Uganda head coach, Jackson Mayanja is firmly focused on his side’s quarter-final clash against the Flying Eagles of Nigeria. Both teams will clash at the Suez Canal Stadium, Ismailia on Thursday night. Victory for either side will see them book a spot at the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Indonesia. The Hippos finished top of Group B with five points from three games. The Flying Eagles on the other claimed the second position in Group A with six points from the same number of games. “This tournament is a bit tricky but this is the game we had to get a result because I also rested my key players because I trust every player,” Mayanja was quoted by CAFonline. “Since we have qualified, now we’re planning for the next one so that we can qualify for the next stage.”
