A man is dead after challenging a Lagos school bus driver who allegedly defiled his seven-year-old daughter. 47-year-old Frederick died on the premises of Luyol School during a scuffle with the suspect known as Jacob. Jacob absconded from the scene and is now the target of a manhunt by the police. Public Relations Officer, SP Benjamin Hundeyin assured that the driver would be arrested and prosecuted. Frederick’s widow narrated how Jacob had been taking her daughter to his house at Ajuwon in Ogun to molest her. The wife said the suspect on the run usually claimed that he needed to drop something at home. She told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that her husband went to school after he was asked to come to settle the matter. “On February 1, my daughter told me that her school bus driver had been taking her to his house in Ajuwon. “The driver would ask my daughter to sit on his lap, to raise her school uniform and to kiss him.” Frederick and his wife went to the school on February 7, met the school owner, the driver and some of the teachers. The proprietor confronted Jacob, recalling he returned late with the school bus the previous week. The widow said after the girl narrated the same experience in front of everyone, the driver queried: “Me?..me?..me?” Frederick then angrily slapped him, which led to a fight; Jacob pushed the father on his chest, causing him to fall. “We rushed him to a hospital, where he was confirmed dead,” the widow disclosed. The incident reported at Iju Police Station is expected to be handled by the Criminal Investigation Department in Panti.
