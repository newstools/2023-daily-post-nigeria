Famous Nigerian singer and internet personality, Peter Okoye, popularly called Mr P, has called out governors of the ruling All Progressive Congress, APC, for asking the Supreme Court to declare President Muhammadu Buhari’s directive on the naira swap as unconstitutional. Recall that President Buhari had on Thursday ordered the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, to recirculate only N200 old notes. This is coming after the Supreme Court did not vacate the order that the old N200, N500, and N1000 notes are still legal tender. Following the president’s directive, some APC governors have been giving contrary directives to citizens in their state to continue accepting the old N500 and N1000 notes. Reacting to this in a series of tweets on his Twitter handle on Monday, Peter accused the governors of fighting for their own selfish reason and agenda. Okoye tweeted: “Dear APC Governors, We, the Nigerian people, are not complaining about the policy. As a matter of fact, we are so used to the hardship APC has brought upon us. We actually stand with Buhari and Emefiele on this one. We still have N50, N100 and N200 Notes in circulation, Desperados. “If the APC Governors fight other issues the way they fight this naira policy, Nigeria would’ve been a better place. Dear Nigerians, don’t be deceived. They are fighting for their own selfish reason and agenda. “APC Governors should stop using “Poor masses” as an excuse and tell President Buhari the truth that they stashed money in higher denominations and they will turn to tissue papers if he insists on this policy.”
