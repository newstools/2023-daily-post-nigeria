Ahead of the 2023 general elections, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Thursday, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to assuage the pain and anguish of Nigerians over the current cash crunch across the country. It also demanded that leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) including its presidential candidate and governors should immediately release the hundreds of billions of new Naira notes allegedly intercepted and hoarded by the ruling party for vote buying purposes in the 2023 general elections. DAILY POST recalled that Buhari, today in his address to the nation had acknowledged, ” the Naira redesign and swap policies are programmes of the APC administration which is also completely in control of the production and circulation of the new notes”. Recall that the PDP had alerted on how APC leaders allegedly sabotaged the system and diverted the new Naira notes to create widespread social unrest to justify their alleged plan to derail the 2023 general elections. The party national spokesman, Nebo Olugunagba said this in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja. Olugunagba added that the PDP had also exposed how APC governors are allegedly warehousing the new Naira notes in facilities in Lagos, Kano, Kogi, Kaduna, Imo and other States of the country for the purpose of vote buying in the presidential election.
