The Conference of Nigeria Political Parties, CNPP, has accused Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State and other governors of the All Progressives Congress, APC, of being desperate to buy votes ahead of next weekend’s general election. In a statement on Saturday signed by its Secretary General, Chief Willy Ezugwu, the CNPP urged Nigerians in Kaduna and other parts of the country to ignore El-Rufai for their own good as only CBN can give directives on legal tender in Nigeria on behalf of the President. CNPP made the assertion while calling on Nigerians not to fall for what it described as the antics of APC Governors as they are not fighting for the wellbeing of the citizens, saying that the “opposing APC leaders are attacking President Muhammadu Buhari and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor Godwin Emefiele because they are desperate to buy votes knowing that APC has failed.” It also urged Buhari to call El-Rufai to order “for declaring Kaduna State a sovereign by ordering the residents to continue to recognise old N500 and N1,000 banknotes as legal tender contrary to presidential directives”. CNPP also reiterated its call on the apex bank to set up modalities for exchanging old naira notes for the Nigerian population, who may have been deceived by the APC Governors to keep their cash till the expiration of the naira swap deadline. DAILY POST reports that this is coming less than two days after El-Rufai addressed the people of Kaduna State amid the scarcity of new naira notes after the CBN redesigned N200, N500 and N1000 notes.
