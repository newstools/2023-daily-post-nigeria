One of the spokespersons for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Presidential Campaign Council, Charles Aniagwu has said the duo of the presidential candidates of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi and the New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, Rabiu Kwankwaso do not pose any threat to Atiku Abubakar. Aniagwu also said that Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress, APC, is just a contestant like other presidential candidates. He made the statement while featuring on Channels Television’s special programme, ‘The 2023 Verdict’, on Wednesday. Aniagwu, also a Commissioner for Information in Delta State, claimed the APC is crying more than the bereaved on the new naira notes swap. He said, “Peter Obi is not a threat; Kwankwaso is not a threat. None of them is a threat; they are contestants in this election. “The challenges they pose is to enable us to also move further into the hinterlands and talk to our people so that they don’t deceive people into following them,” Aniagwu said.
