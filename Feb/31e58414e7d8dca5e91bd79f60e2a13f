National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS, has commended Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State for releasing palliatives to ameliorate the plight of the people in the state suffering due to naira scarcity. The body, however, noted that students are the most affected by the naira scarcity occasioned by the currency redesign of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN. NANS said most Point of Sales, POS, operators are students and are suffering due to the cash crunch. In a statement, the students said the Governor’s gesture demonstrated his commitment to the welfare and well-being of Ogun State citizens and residents. The statement was signed by Comrade Damilola Simeon Kehinde, Chairman of NANS Joint Campus Committee, JCC, Ogun axis, and Comrade Olufemi Owoeye, Public Relations Officer, NANS JCC/Ogun axis. The Governor kickstarted the distribution of 400,000 food items to some residents of the state. The statement reads: “It is, therefore, heartwarming that Ogun State Government has shown itself to be apparently in touch with the current realities of its constituents and have thus taken the bull by the horn by providing the much needed succour via free food items distribution. “We, therefore, commend the Governor for this lifesaving initiative as many families are indeed unable to procure good food for their consumption. NANS urged the Governor to prioritise students ahead of other sectors because “Nigerian students are going through a horrendous time, and food is a major problem for many.” “Without gainsaying, the students are the worst hit by the ongoing cash crunch as essential materials, including food have tripled in cost while access to funds have been severely limited. “We must remember that a sizable number of POS business owners are students and have been largely out of business due to unavailability of cash. In addition, students who engage in other forms of business are experiencing abysmal patronage due to the aforementioned cause,” the statement added.
