The Kaduna State Government on Sunday warned against any unruly behaviour that can lead to a breakdown of law and order. The Commissioner, Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Kaduna State, Samuel Aruwan in a statement said the warning became necessary following credible intelligence received. According to him, the state government received reports of individuals who are ready to disrupt public peace. The Kaduna State Government, while warning the citizens and planners of the protest to stay away, stated that such protests remain strictly prohibited. Aruwan advised residents to avoid all actions capable of inciting a breakdown of law and order, even as he warned that residents must shun the baitings of mischievous groups hoping to capitalise on the present challenge and incite violence. He said the Kaduna State Government and other concerned state governments, are deploying the full instrumentality of the law to attain a proper resolution, and thus bring relief to citizens. The statement noted that the government is also studying options for addressing challenges being faced by citizens with regard to transport to their places of work. While security organisations have been placed on high alert and had been directed by the government to decisively uphold law and order, he said any resort to unruly or violent conduct is illegal and against the public interest which values law and order.
