Former Paris Saint-Germain midfielder, Austin Jay-Jay Okocha, has heaped praises on former Chelsea winger, Victor Moses. Okocha described Moses as a great footballer, adding that the 32-year-old played at a high level for the Blues. The Nigerian legend also backed Moses to fully recover from injury and help his current club Spartak Moscow become Russian Premier League champions. Recall that Moses has not played competitively for Moscow since suffering an Achilles tendon injury against Ural in the Russian Premier League on August 6, 2022. “Victor is a great football player who played at a high level at Chelsea and is now showing his worth at Spartak,” Okocha told Sport24. “It is a pity that he has an injury, but I want to wish him only the very best. “I am sure that when Moses recovers from the injury and returns to the squad, he will help Spartak become the champion.” Moses spent nine years at Chelsea before joining Spartak Moscow on a permanent transfer in 2021.
