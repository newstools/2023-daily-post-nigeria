Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has asked that results from polling units where the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) was not used should be nullified. Obasanjo also requested that results that were not uploaded on the server of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) should not accepted. Obasanjo said this in a letter to President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday, while speaking on Saturday’s presidential election. “Whereas, BVAS and Servers have been manipulated or rendered inactive, such results must be declared void and inadmissible for election declaration,” Obasanjo told Buhari and the Chairman of INEC, Mahmood Yakubu. The Balogun Owu alerted Buhari that tension is building up across the nation asking that elections that were not credible be rejected and be re-conducted on Saturday. ”Your Excellency, let all elections that do not pass the credibility and transparency test be cancelled and be brought back with areas where elections were disrupted for next Saturday, March 4, 2023, and BVAS and Server officials be changed.” The former President said a committee of INEC staff be set up with representatives of the four major political parties so as to know which stations or polling units were manipulated. Obasanjo said the Chairman of Nigerian Bar Association should also be in the committee, asking that members “look into what must be done to have hitch-free elections next Saturday.”
