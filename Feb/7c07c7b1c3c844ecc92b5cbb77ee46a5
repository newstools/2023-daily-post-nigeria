Manchester United defender, Lisandro Martinez has Arsenal striker, Gabriel Jesus as his toughest opponent since he arrived in the Premier League. Martinez has been impressive for the Red Devils since his £57m move from Ajax last summer. There were fears the 25-year-old could be exposed in the Premier League due to his height. But Martinez has gone on to form an impressive centre-back partnership with Raphael Varane and won the World Cup with Argentina in December. The diminutive defender has come up against some of the best forwards in the world this season, enjoying battles with the likes of Erling Haaland and Harry Kane. But Martinez cited Jesus as his toughest opponent since arriving in England in an interview with the Daily Telegraph. Jesus missed Arsenal’s 3-2 victory over United last month through injury but played in their 3-1 defeat at Old Trafford earlier in the season.
