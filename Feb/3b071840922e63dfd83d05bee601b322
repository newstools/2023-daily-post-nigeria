Akwa United manager, Ayodeji Ayeni has showered encomium on his players following the slim 1-0 victory against Gombe United on Thursday. Uche Collins’ eight minutes header from James Ajako’s superb cross was enough for the Promise Keepers to record their fourth win of the season. Gombe United fought hard to get back into the game but Akwa United held on to the lead for the entire duration of the game. Ayeni praised his players for their determination despite the strong performance from the away team. “I really want to commend my players for today’s victory. Their determination and never say die spirit gave us this victory,” Ayeni said in his post match briefing. “I’m excited that we were able to score and defend till the end. We always go with the aim of scoring many goals but where we can’t score, we don’t have to concede.”
