The Assistant Director, Media and Publicity, Tinubu, Shettima Campaign Council, Biodun Ajiboye, has said the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, and not President Muhammadu Buhari should be held responsible for the poor exchange rate of the Naira against the Dollar. Ajiboye made the statement on Thursday while fielding questions on Arise Television’s Morning Show. He accused Emefiele of being a mole working for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, against the All Progressives Congress, APC-led administration, noting former President Goodluck Jonathan appointed him to achieve a particular purpose. Ajiboye further added that he would have fired him and taken propositions from other people who can manage the exchange rate properly, if he were the president. He said, ”An institution manages the exchange rate in question and not the Villa. The institution managing it should take the blame for the unprecedented increase or decrease and for the ability to curtail the exchange rate. ”That the exchange rate is ballooning beyond a reasonable doubt is not entirely the fault of the president or the presidency. But at the same time, if I were the president, for instance, and I see, I feel and know that the exchange rate is going beyond reasonable proportion, I probably would ask the CBN governor, is it that you don’t know what to do? Or what exactly is the problem? If he does not give me a good reason, as chief executive, I will fire him and take propositions from other people who can manage the exchange rate properly. ”I personally don’t see any reason why Emefiele should have continued in the office. Emefiele was a PDP appointee; for whatever reason, President Goodluck Jonathan would not have appointed him if he didn’t suit his purpose. Therefore, I can infer rightly that Emefiele was and is PDP. “His attempt to join APC and his branded vehicles should mean that, at a time, he probably wanted to cross to APC.”
