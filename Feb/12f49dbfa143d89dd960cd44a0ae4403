Newcastle’s players will share bonuses of £1million if they beat Manchester United in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday. The Magpies are looking to win the club’s first trophy in 48 years. The squad’s bonus pool is 10 times the money Newcastle will receive in prize money for winning the trophy. However, the club’s owners are eager to reward the squad for what would be a historic achievement. The bonuses will be shared among the players using a complex formula involving both matches and minutes played in this season’s competition. The manager Eddie Howe will also receive a bonus stipulated in his contract if he succeeds in leading the team to triumph. The Carabao Cup winners will receive £100,000 and runners-up £50,000.
