The Senator representing the Enugu East Senatorial District, Chimaroke Nnamani, who is also seeking re-election, has reacted to the killing of his counterpart of the Labour Party, Oyibo Chukwu. In a seemingly taunting statement, the former Enugu State governor said the deceased was not favoured to win the election as speculated on social media. He also said the late Oyibo Chukwu was largely unknown and that his party (LP) thrives on deception and social media stunts, claiming it was impossible defeating him as a sitting senator and past two-term governor of the state. His reaction is contained in a statement via his verified Twitter handle on Thursday. Recall that DAILY POST reported that Oyibo Chukwu was murdered and set ablaze alongside other party members on Wednesday evening at Amaechi Awkunanaw, Enugu South Local Government Area of the State. It was also gathered that the unidentified persons accosted them while riding in a Toyota Sienna vehicle. Nnamani said he would welcome any opportunity for INEC to postpone the senatorial election in Enugu East Senatorial District. He wrote, “We welcome any opportunity for INEC to postpone the senatorial election in Enugu East Senatorial District. While we strongly condemn the senseless killing of the LP senatorial candidate for the election by yet-to-be-identified gunmen, deeply sympathize with all the bereaved, and urge the investigative agencies to fish out the perpetrators. ”Any suggestion that the deceased was favoured to win the election is ridiculous to say the least. It is only a party that thrives on deception and social media stunts that would claim it was about defeating a sitting senator and past two-term governor of the state with a candidate that was largely unknown (may his soul rest in peace) Indeed the postponement will allow the world to see how it has been scammed by the Labour Party.”
