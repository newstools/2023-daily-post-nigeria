One of President Muhammadu Buhari’s media aides, Bashir Ahmad, has insisted his principal will not interfere with the electoral process. Ahmad said this in reaction to a statement released by former president, Olusegun Obasanjo. Obasanjo called on Buhari to take urgent steps to address the tensions that followed allegations of discrepancies in election results. He also called on elections to be cancelled and redone in areas found to have been affected by compromise. “So Chief Olusegun Obasanjo wants President Muhammadu Buhari to interfere with our electoral process halfway. “The President will never do that. He always allows such institutions to work, independently,” Ahmad tweeted.
