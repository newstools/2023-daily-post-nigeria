Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani Bello has charged all members of the All Progressives Congress, APC, to close ranks and woo voters to ensure victory for the party in the general elections. Bello gave the charge when he inaugurated a 65-man campaign council of the Party for Niger North Senatorial District (Zone C) in Kontagora, headquarters of the zone, noting that voting the party back into power would help consolidate the successes so far recorded. The governor said: “Close ranks, get to the people at the grassroots and canvass for votes. Logistics will be made available to all local governments in the zone.  “I urge you to remain resolute about the victory of the party at the polls to consolidate on the successes recorded.” Responding, the chairman of the campaign council and Commissioner for Local Government, Community Development and Chieftaincy Affairs, Kabiru Abbas, on behalf of other members, promised to work diligently and make concerted efforts for the success of the APC in the zone.
