Out-of-favour Chelsea striker, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, is set for a shock move to Paris Saint-Germain. PSG are reportedly interested in signing Aubameyang from Chelsea in the summer transfer window. Aubameyang has not had the best of times since joining Chelsea from Barcelona last summer. The former Arsenal captain has scored just three goals in 17 appearances across all competitions for the Blues, starting in just 10 of them. The Gabonese star was also left out of Chelsea’s UEFA Champions League squad for the knockout stages. The 33-year-old was not even included in Chelsea’s match-day squad in their last two Premier League matches against West Ham United and Fulham. However, according to SPORT, PSG are monitoring Aubameyang’s situation and could make an attempt to sign him in the summer. The French Ligue 1 champions wanted to sign Aubameyang back in 2017 as well, but the attacker stayed put at Borussia Dortmund and eventually joined Arsenal the following year. The Parisians can now look to sign Aubameyang in the summer, with him clearly out of favour at Chelsea under manager Graham Potter.
