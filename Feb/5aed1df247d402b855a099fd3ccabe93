Jorge, the father to Paris Saint-Germain forward Lionel Messi, has said his son will not return to Barcelona this summer. The 35-year-old’s future is up in the air with his current deal set to expire in June. Messi has been in fine form for the Ligue 1 champions this campaign, with a total of 28 goals and assists in 24 appearances in all competitions. Despite his fine form, L’Equipe reports the World Cup winner is “less and less tempted” to remain in France. That has prompted speculation that Messi could move to MLS or return to Barcelona. Jorge, who also acts as his agent, has told SPORT: “I don’t think Leo will play for Barcelona again. “The conditions are not met. We have not spoken with [Barcelona president Joan] Laporta and there is no offer on the table.”
