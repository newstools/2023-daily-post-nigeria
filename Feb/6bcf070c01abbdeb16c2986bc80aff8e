Chelsea boss, Graham Potter, has explained when he decided to hand Enzo Fernandez his full debut against Fulham. Fernandez starts in midfield as the Blues seek to improve their 10th place in the Premier League. Speaking to Sky Sports ahead of the game about when he decided to hand Enzo Fernandez an immediate start: “As soon as the paperwork came through and we know he can play and he is able to do it, it was clear. “He is an impressive young man, great character, personality and I’m looking forward to seeing him play.” Hakim Ziyech also starts, only days after his loan move to Paris Saint-Germain collapsed. On starting Ziyech, despite a paperwork error causing a move to PSG to fall through, Potter said: “He has played the last couple for us and done well. I had a conversation with him and I think he is old enough and experienced enough to know these things can happen sometimes in football. “He has always been committed to the team and I thought it was right for him to play and help the team.”
