Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has described the first half of their Premier League clash with Leicester City as rubbish. He also singled out three of his players for praise following their 3-0 win against Leicester City. Marcus Rashford struck twice while Jadon added the third to give the Old Trafford landlords all three points at Old Trafford. Leicester City were in control of the first half and went close to opening the scoring through Harvey Barnes and Kelechi Iheanacho. David De Gea made some outstanding saves to keep the Foxes out on both occasions. “Today was really tough but it was first that Leicester played brilliantly but second that we were rubbish. “It was only because of David De Gea that we got a clean sheet until half-time. We were lucky that we scored a goal. Great ball from Bruno, great run from Rashy.”
