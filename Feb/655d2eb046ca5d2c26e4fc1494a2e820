The Football Association has begun an investigation into a video clip involving Chelsea winger, Mykhaylo Mudryk, in which he was repeating a racial slur, The Athletic reports. Mudryk completed a Â£88m move to Stamford Bridge this January. The Ukraine international has made only one appearance for the Blues against Liverpool. But the 22-year-old has already become caught up in controversy after a historical video of him posted on TikTok. In a clip posted in July 2022, Mudryk recited a 2017 rap song called Freestyle by American artist Lil Baby and repeated the N-word. Mudryk has since deleted the video and apologised via his representatives. But Mudryk is now facing a probe from the Football Association and a potential ban.
