Manchester United legend, Gary Neville, has singled out Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg for praise following Tottenham Hotspur’s 1-0 win over Manchester City on Sunday. Neville described Hojbjerg’s display for Tottenham against Man City as absolutely outstanding, adding that he was brilliant against Pep Guardiola’s side. Harry Kane scored the only goal of the match as Cristian Romero was shown a red card. Speaking on Sky Sports, Neville said, “Hojbjerg has been absolutely outstanding, obviously the assist for Kane, the goal, but the way in which he has broken up plays, his energy, his leadership skills, he has been brilliant today.” The result against Man City means Tottenham are in fifth position on the log with 39 points from 22 games.
