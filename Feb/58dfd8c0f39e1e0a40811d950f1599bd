Following the tension that is gradually building up over the scarcity of naira notes and fuel, the Ondo State Police Command has warned residents of the state against any form of protest. While warning against action that can lead to a breach of peace in the state, the Commissioner of Police, Oyeyemi Oyediran, revealed that he has received security reports on the situation. According to Oyediran, the Command is aware of plans to stage a protest in order to air grievances. He urged those planning the protest to refrain from such activities because relevant organisations had been invited to the meeting to help shed more light on the current difficulties the people of the state are facing. While a representative of NUPENG addressed stakeholders at the meeting, a bank manager also provided insight into what caused the scarcity of naira notes. The CP maintained that the protest might be used by criminals to commit other terrible crimes in the state or be hijacked by hoodlums given the stateâ€™s current security condition. After the discussion, it was suggested that a task force should be formed to keep an eye on the actions of the affected institutions and guarantee that issues raised are well handled.
