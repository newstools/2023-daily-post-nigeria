The Rivers State Government has denied being part of the arrest of 30 members of Atiku Abubakar’s campaign organization in Port Harcourt. Atiku, presidential flagbearer of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and the Rivers governor, have been in a battle of words since the party’s primary election. Reports emerged on Sunday that armed policemen arrested about 30 members of the campaign organisation during a meeting in Port Harcourt. The spokesman of the campaign organisation, Victor Moses, had said that some of those arrested were state and local government leaders of the campaign organisation. The campaign spokesman alleged that the police operatives acted on the instructions of Wike, who had vowed to work against the candidacy of Atiku in the forthcoming election. But the Rivers State Commissioner for Information, Chris Finebone, while reacting to the allegation on Monday, said it was illogical for the Atiku Campaign Organization to link Governor Wike to issues it has with the police. Denying the report, Finebone told Channels Television that the allegation is one of the instances in which people find it convenient to point an accusing finger at a government in power.
