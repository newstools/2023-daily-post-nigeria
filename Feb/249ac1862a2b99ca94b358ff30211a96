Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar, has opened up on the reported clash he had with sporting director Luis Campos during his side’s 3-1 Ligue 1 defeat to AS Monaco over the weekend. Campos was reportedly livid with the PSG players, including Neymar, at half-time of their defeat to Monaco and held a discussion with them. However, Neymar has now provided a sneak peek of the discussion without providing many details, insisting that he and Campos didn’t agree. “It happened, a little discussion, we didn’t agree. It happens to us every day, but I love them all, it is like with my girlfriend. Football is not just about love, not just friendship. There is respect, but it happens to have discussions. We aren’t used to losing; when there are defeats, of course, that disturbs us. It makes part of the process to improve,” Neymar said (via RMC Sports). He continued, “For the locker room, it sometimes lies what comes out in the press, and it goes around the world. It happened that rumours came out at key moments of the season. We have to find out what is going on. It isn’t normal for stories to come out in the press. It has to stay between us. “We have to walk together. When there is news like that, we are angry. I guarantee you that a lot of information is wrong, but some are true.”
