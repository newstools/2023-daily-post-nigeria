Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, has defended Vinicius after the forward received more racist attacks and insults in Los Blancos’ La Liga 1-0 defeat against Mallorca on Sunday. Speaking ahead of Real Madrid’s Club World Cup semi-final tie against Al Ahly on Wednesday, Ancelotti did not hesitate to publicly defend Vinicius. The Italian said at his pre-match press conference, “The problem is Vinicius? Vinicius’ teammates? What does Vinicius have to defend himself against? The problem is what happens around Vinicius. And that is the end of it. “It is a problem in Spanish football that we have to solve. Vinicius is the victim of something I don’t understand.” Vinicius has been subjected to hate attacks since he arrived in Spain back in 2018. The most recent was last weekend at a Spanish league game in Mallorca. In January, Vinicius’ effigy hung off a bridge in Madrid before Real’s Copa del Rey derby against Atletico Madrid.
