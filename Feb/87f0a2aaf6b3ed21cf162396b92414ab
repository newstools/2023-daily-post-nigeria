The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar on Saturday rubbished claims by a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, chieftain, Femi Fani-Kayode that he secretly met with serving military generals. Atiku accused Fani-Kayode of lying, while charging him to provide the day the meeting held. Shaibu added that Femi Fani-Kayode, who runs the social media arm of the APC campaign, had also been an active propagator of fake news. Speaking through his Media Aide, Phrank Shaibu, Atiku described Fani-Kayode’s claim as another “tale by moonlight.” Speaking with DAILY POST, Shaibu said: “Atiku was in Bauchi on Wednesday, Kano on Thursday and has been in Yola since Friday. It is a common principle in logic that a person cannot be in two places at the same time. Unfortunately, the APC’s lies are bereft of any modicum of intelligence. “These people are so desperate that they are trying to use lies to get into Aso Rock. He should tell Nigerians when Atiku met with those generals.” Fani-Kayode said the alleged meeting between Atiku and the military generals could have troubling implications on the presidential election. He wondered if Atiku’s alleged meeting with military generals is a coup d’etat. The APC chieftain wondered what could be the agenda of such a meeting.
