Manchester United manager, Erik ten Hag, has given injury updates ahead of Wednesday’s Premier League clash with Leeds. Antony will miss the game, after leaving the field in discomfort during United’s 2-1 win over Crystal Palace last Saturday. Ten Hag has also revealed Anthony Martial and Scott McTominay are unavailable due to their own respective knocks. “They [Martial and McTominay] are not involved tomorrow. “And the same with Antony dos Santos. He is also not available for tomorrow so we have to sort that out,” Ten Hag told reporters today.
