The Social Democratic Party, SDP, has denied adopting All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate and Oyo Governor Seyi Makinde ahead of the general elections. A statement by the National Secretary, Saleh Dass, made the clarification in a statement on Wednesday. Dass recalled the National Working Committee, NWC, only gave an advice to state chapters due to the lingering court case over the legitimate constitution of the leadership. The directive issued was that they were at liberty to enter into alliances “with an opposition party”, for the purpose of the elections in February and March. Dass noted that those who decided to align with the ruling APC as well as the PDP in Oyo took a position that violated the resolution of the SDP. The NWC has constituted a five-member committee with Senator Ebenezer Ikeyina as Chairman, the secretary announced. Mallam Nasiru N’Abba, Mr Kelvin Damara, Mrs Y. Nolan are members, while Mrs Adenike Olujembola will serve as Secretary. The committee is to meet regarding the reports that some leaders of the SDP in Oyo and elsewhere are supporting Tinbu and Makinde “contrary to the directive of the party”.
