He said that people should avoid religious gatherings that see only negativity. According to the singer, in a post shared on his Instagram page on Friday, “Avoid religious gatherings that only see bad things. God didn’t create you and envelope in suffering and curses. God is love. God loves you.” Recall that Timi had a few weeks ago, in a tweet advised Nigerians to be mindful of people they allow to lay hands on them for prayers. He warned parents not to allow people to lay hands on their kids if they had been careless with themselves in the past. However, the singer did not give details of what informed his advice.
