Having broken the club’s goal record and set a new one, Harry Kane has been told to leave Tottenham Hotspur without further delay. Chelsea legend Tony Cascarino said Kane should join PSG and form a strike partnership with Kylian Mbappe. Despite hitting the 200-goal mark for the club, the England international has not won any major trophy in all his years from White Hart Lane to the London Stadium. The England captain’s current deal runs out at the end of the 2023-24 season, and the 29-year-old is yet to sign a new one. Cascarino wrote in his column in the Times: “If I were in Kane’s boots and had the choice of all the teams around Europe – which I believe he will – I would choose PSG. “They are filled with world-class players, are ambitious, and I think Kane could build a wonderful partnership with Kylian Mbappé. Together they would be formidable.”
