Following the scarcity of fuel and naira notes that have disrupted the socio-economic activities of Nigeria, residents of Ondo State in Ore Local Government Area on Tuesday protested over the development. The resident who appeared visibly frustrated over the lingering situation barricaded the busy Ore-Benin expressway. They lamented that the situation has had a severe impact on their livelihood. Travellers who were caught in the gridlock have been stranded for hours as the protesters vowed not to open up the road. According to one of the protesters Bayo Oke, Nigerians can no longer cope with the hardship ravaging the country, describing it as quite alarming. â€œWe are protesting to send a message to the government, that we the masses are suffering.
