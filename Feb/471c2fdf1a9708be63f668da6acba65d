Surgeon Gianpaolo Tartaro has said he doesn’t know why Victor Osimhen still plays in a protective mask. Osimhen underwent surgery after sustaining a fracture on his cheekbone and eye socket in Napoli’s Serie A clash against Inter Milan in 2021. The Nigeria international picked up the injury following a nasty head clash with Inter’s Skriniar. Tartaro performed facial surgery on Osimhen. The 24-year-old has been playing with a protective mask since returning to the pitch. “Superstition? I don’t know. It was modeled and remodeled with the assistance of the player so that it doesn’t create the slightest discomfort, “Tartaro told II Mattino when asked why Osimhen still wears the mask. Osimhen has scored 21 goals in 25 appearances across all competitions for Napoli this season.
