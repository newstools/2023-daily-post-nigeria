Liverpool legend, Jamie Carragher has hit out at Liverpool duo, Joel Matip and Joe Gomez for their poor performances in the Reds’ Premier League disappointing 3-0 defeat to Wolves on Saturday. Carragher singled out Matip and Gomez for their displays for Liverpool against Wolves, referring to them as “shambolic.” Matip compounded Liverpool’s woes by scoring an own goal five minutes into the match, with Craig Dawson and Ruben Neves also scoring for Wolves to give the hosts all three points against Jurgen Klopp’s side at Molineux Stadium. Matip and Gomez were clearly overwhelmed by Wolves attackers, and Carragher was visibly unhappy with the lack of focus and discipline from the two defenders. Writing on his Twitter account, Carragher said: “It’s not too difficult to play centre-back next to the leader of the back four, judge center-backs when they have to lead themselves. Shambolic.”
