The challenges facing Nigeria are surmountable with unity, faith and commitment, the Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, has said. Tinubu said this at the Meet the Mentor Dinner organised by the Progressive Sisters Network (PSN) on Sunday in Abuja. “As a nation, we are facing some challenges, but these challenges can be overcome. We have the capacity to find our way in situations where there seems to be no way. “Please, let’s work together to build the Nigeria of our dreams. I know it is difficult not to look for the easy way in today’s Nigeria, but together with our faith in one another and our nation, we can solve our problems,” he stressed. Tinubu said if elected as the country’s president, he would ensure that Nigeria’s mineral resources are effectively harnessed to bring her greatness. “We will achieve greatness in this country, let us just believe in ourselves,” Tinubu assured and thanked the organisers of the dinner.
