Argentina goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez, has revealed that captain Lionel Messi advised against him doing his infamous celebration after winning the Golden Glove award. Martinez was named the goalkeeper of the 2022 FIFA World Cup for his outstanding performances. The Aston Villa keeper had a controversial celebration afterwards, holding the Golden Glove near his crotch. His actions divided opinions, as many pointed out that his behaviour was against the spirit of the game. However, Martinez has now revealed that even Messi advised against him performing the move. Martinez told France Football (via GOAL): “Do I regret the celebrations? Well, there are things I would not do again in the same way, I didn’t set out to hurt anyone. Throughout my career, I have played with French people and I have never had a problem… You can ask Giroud what kind of person I am. I really like the French culture and mentality. “The gesture I made with the best goalkeeper trophy was a joke with my teammates. I had already done it at the Copa America, and they all said to me: ‘No way’ to do it again. Even Leo told me that. I did it for them, nothing more. It lasted a second and that was it.”
