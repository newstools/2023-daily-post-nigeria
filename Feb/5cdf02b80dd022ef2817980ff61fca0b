The Coalition of Southern and Middle Belt Youth Leaders Assembly, COSMBYLA, has condemned an alleged verbal attack on the Benue State governor Samuel Ortom by the former CBN governor, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. Governor Ortom had a few days ago, alleged that some Fulani elite, led by the deposed emir, was after his life over the unfortunate killing of some herders in Nasarawa State. The governor who accused Sanusi of pointing fingers at him said that he had no hands in the incident. Reacting, COSMBYLA, an umbrella body of all the youth groups in South East, South South, South West and Middle Belt regions condemned Sanusi’s allegation, describing it as unfortunate. The coalition, in a statement issued by its President General, Goodluck Ibem, said: “It is quite unfortunate that Sanusi will make such baseless and unfounded allegations against Governor Ortom. How will Ortom attack herdsmen with a helicopter when he has no personal or state-owned helicopter? “Herdsmen have been attacking and killing Benue indigenes on a daily basis in Benue State and the governor did not attack them back with a helicopter. It is very laughable that a man of Sanusi’s standing will make such an unfounded statement. “Sanusi should be arrested immediately by security agencies for all the assassination attempts on the life of Governor Samuel Ortom who has always obeyed the law to the letter.”
