Femi Fani-Kayode on Sunday predicted victory for Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of All Progressives Congress, APC. A statement by the former presidential aide declared that Tinubu will not be “robbed” like the late Obafemi Awolowo and MKO Abiola. Fani-Kayode said the ruling party and its flagbearer were ready to go into the February 25th battle with strength and power. He noted that no matter how thick the conspiracy is, they shall stand firm, hold the line, keep the flag flying and “prove that we are men.” “60 years ago Awolowo was robbed and lost it, 30 years ago Abiola was robbed and lost it. “30 years later and in two weeks’ time, despite the desperation, plots and plans of our enemies, history will not repeat itself, Tinubu will not be robbed.” The former Minister of Aviation charged the Jagaban Army to stay strong, assuring that Nigeria will soon renew and regain its lost glory. Advising Tinubu’s supporters never to waver, FFK maintains “Asiwaju shall be President” because it’s “his turn and our time.”
