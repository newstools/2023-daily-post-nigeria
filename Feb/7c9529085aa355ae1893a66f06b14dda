President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday commiserated with the family of a prominent businesswoman and committed All Progressives Congress, APC, stalwart, Mrs Bewaji Kuku, who passed on recently. In a condolence message he issued through spokesman, Malam Garba Shehu, Buhari condoled with the APC family in Lagos State on losing a frontline politician. He noted that the deceased had contributed time and resources to the development and cohesion that had become the hallmark of Lagos as the City of Progressives. Buhari recalled her indelible contributions to the Policy, Research and Strategy Directorate of the APC Presidential Council in 2015. He also lauded her for deploying her experiences as a chartered administrator to galvanise and enhance the participation of women in political activities.
