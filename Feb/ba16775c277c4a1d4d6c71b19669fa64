Manchester City are reportedly considering Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta as their next manager if Pep Guardiola leaves the Etihad at the end of the season. As per Four Four Two, Man City are huge admirers of the work Arteta has done at Arsenal so far. Man City view Arteta as the perfect candidate to take over from Guardiola. Prior to taking charge at Arsenal, Arteta worked as Guardiola’s assistant at Man City for more than three years. The Citizens are going through an uncertain period following an investigation from the Premier League over financial rule-breaching. The situation has put Guardiola’s position at the club in serious doubt. The former Bayern Munich and Barcelona head coach had previously made it clear earlier that he would leave Man City if it was proven that the club had lied to him. Guardiola is unlikely to remain in charge of Man City beyond this season as Paris Saint-Germain are ready to make an offer for the Spaniard if he decides to quit the Premier League champions.
