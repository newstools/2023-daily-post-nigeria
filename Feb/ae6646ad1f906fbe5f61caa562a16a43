Chelsea legend, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, has slammed his former club, saying they are not good enough after their Premier League 2-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Chelsea were beaten 2-0 against Tottenham, following goals from Oliver Skipp and Harry Kane. The result means Chelsea have won just one of their last 11 games in all competitions and are currently stuck in 10th position on the Premier League table. “The amount of passes is not really that important. What is important is have you worked as the goalkeeper? Fraser Forster had an easy day,” Hasselbaink said on Sky Sports. “For a Chelsea team, that isn’t good enough! Now you can spin it and say that Spurs were amazing at the back, they defended with five, and they did really well defensively. “They did. But as a big team, you always find a moment, a really good chance and that moment never came today.”
