The 75 coronet Obas installed by Senator Ibikunle Amosun have appealed to Governor Dapo Abiodun to reinstate them. DAILY POST reports that the sacked monarchs begged Abiodun to obey a court judgment which ordered that they be reinstated. Recall that Amosun had during the tail end of his administration promoted some Village Heads known as Baales to the position of coronet Obas. But after his assumption of office, Abiodun set up a committee headed by the Olu Ilaro, Oba Kehinde Olugbenle, who recommended the demotion of the said Obas. As Abiodun implemented the recommendation of Olugbenle, the affected Obas headed to court and they got a favourable judgment, which the State government is yet to adhere to. Speaking through their principal counsel, Barrister Olumide Oniyire, the monarchs urged the Ogun State Government to obey the November 29, 2021 ruling and reinstate them as coronet wearing Obas. According to the counsel, the Ogun State government had filed an appeal against the judgment seeking a stay of execution of the judgment, but it was dismissed. Oniyire begged the state government to do the needful by returning the Obas to their palaces to avoid contempt of court.
