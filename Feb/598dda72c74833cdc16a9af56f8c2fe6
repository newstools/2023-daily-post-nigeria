Napoli President, Aurelio De Laurentiis has refused to rule out the possibility of selling Victor Osimhen any time soon. Osimhen arrived Naples from Ligue 1 club, Lille in 2020 and has grown to become one of the most fearsome forwards in the world. The 24-year-old scored for the eighth consecutive game in Napoli’s 2-0 win against Bundesliga club, Eintracht Frankfurt on Tuesday night. Overall, the Nigerian has netted 20 times in 24 outings across all competitions for the Partenopei this season. There is a growing interest in Osimhen from Premier League giants, Chelsea and Manchester United, who will look to secure his services this summer. De Laurentiis admitted he would love to see Osimhen remain at the club for a long time but know he can’t turn down a tempting offer him. “I am very good at making contracts, so when they come to me, they are blocked, so keeping them here won’t be difficult,” he told TNT Sports Mexico. “However, never say never. Sometimes there are offers you can’t refuse, so you never know. To me, we’ll see them shine for a long time.”
