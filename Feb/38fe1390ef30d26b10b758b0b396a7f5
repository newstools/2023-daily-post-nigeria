Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, has again hit out at the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Godwin Emefiele over the Naira redesign. Fani-Kayode, in a tweet on Tuesday, claimed that Emefiele and those who sent him to bring “hardship and misery to Nigerians will rue the day” if the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu wins the election. According to him, the old Naira notes “will come back”. He wrote: “By Saturday after Asiwaju wins all this nonsense stops & everyone will know their place in the scheme of things. “As for the old notes be rest assured that they will come back. “Emefiele is not God and those who sent him to bring hardship & misery to Nigerians will rue the day.”
