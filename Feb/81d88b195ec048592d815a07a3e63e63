Prof. Razaq Abubakre, ex-Vice Chancellor of Al-Hikmah University in Ilorin, said evil plotters were scheming to stop Bola Tinubu from becoming President. The scholar declared the All Progressives Congress, APC, co-founder as the best 2023 presidential candidate. Abubakre hailed Tinubu for appointing competent citizens without discriminating, adding that he would replicate his achievements in Lagos if elected. He said the flagbearer’s solutions to issues make him fit to address insecurity, low national cohesion, revenue challenges, exodus of youths, among others. “Many actors in his detractors’ political camps often behave as agnostics, underestimating what God shall do,” he noted. Abubakre accused Tinubu’s opponents of putting stones, snakes and scorpions on his way to stop him. The ex-Commissioner in Osun Public Complaints Commission said enemies’ stratagems often boomerang resulting in a reversal of fortune for them. He stressed that God’s power abides by Tinubu and shall grant him “victory at the poll to the eternal chagrin of the evil plotters”. Abubakre, former Dean of the Faculty of Arts at the University of Ilorin, is a member of Agba Osun (Elders of Osun).
