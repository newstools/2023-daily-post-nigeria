As the collation of the presidential election continues, some youths have protested against the results being reeled out. The protesters, who are mostly youths, stormed the national collation centre, the International Conference Centre, ICC, in Abuja, to express their displeasure over the election results. The youths, led by activist, Moses Ogidi-Paul, described the conduct of the presidential election as disgraceful. Placards displayed by the protesters read: “BeingbackIREV, no IREV no collation,” “Nigeria not for sale, we fight for justice,” “INEC keep your promises” among others. At the time of this report, no INEC official has come out to address the protesting youths.
