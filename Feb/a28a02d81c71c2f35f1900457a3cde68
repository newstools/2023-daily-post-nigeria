Justice Chukujekwu Aneke of the Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos, on Wednesday adjourned hearing in the trial of former Ekiti governor Ayodele Fayose to March 20. The politician and his company, Spotless Investment Limited are being prosecuted over an alleged N6.9 billion fraud. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on July 2, 2019 re-arraigned Fayose and Spotless on an 11-count charge bordering on money laundering and stealing. The defendants were first arraigned on October 22, 2018 before Justice Mojisola Olatoregun. Musiliu Obanikoro was questioned by prosecution counsel Rotimi Jacobs, SAN, at the resumed sitting today. During cross-examination by counsel to the second defendant, Olakekan Ojo, SAN, he narrated how N2.2 billion was budgeted for the 2014 Ekiti governorship poll by the NSA’s Office. Obanikoro stated that the funds came from the NSA’s security account to Silver Maclamaran Nigeria Limited, a company he controls. The former Minister of State for Defence however distanced himself from Silver’s daily operations and denied being a signatory. “Olalekan Olafare is the signatroy…I was the chairman of the Committee and a lot of funds were contributed even up to the national level of our party,” he said. Asked if he could remember the name of any member of the fund-raising committee, Obanikoro mentioned T. K. Aluko and Lateef Agbaje.
