A Shariah court sitting at Filin Hockey area of Kano metropolis has ordered the remand of a famous TikTok skit maker, Murja Ibrahim Kunya, in a correctional center. DAILY POST reports that the popular skit maker was on Thursday arraigned on charges that border on defamation of character, vulgarity, public nuisance and breach of public peace. The defamation charge was added to the count following a complaint filed by two other Tik Tokers: Aisha Najamu and Idris Maiwushirya, accusing Murja of defaming their character. After all the charges were read to the accused by the prosecuting counsel, Lamido Sorondinki, she pleaded not guilty. Thereafter, Murja’s lawyer, Yasir Musa moved an application for her bail, but was opposed by the prosecution counsel. Abdullahi Halliru, the Judge, ordered that the accused person be remanded in prison custody and adjourned the case till February 16 for ruling on the bail application. Recall that Miss Murja was recently arrested by the police in Kano on the order of a Shari’a court.
