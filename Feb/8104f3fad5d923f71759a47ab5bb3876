The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar, has disclosed how he stopped former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s third term bid. He disclosed this at an event with the party’s National Assembly candidates on Sunday night in Abuja. According to Atiku: “During my tenure as Vice President, I developed a very intimate relationship with members of the National Assembly, and it is that relationship that enabled us to stop the third term presidency attempt by Obasanjo. “I really look forward to re-engaging you as you return to the National Assembly for your functions from the constitution to further deepen democracy development and progress of our nation.” The PDP flag bearer, who decried the current security and economic predicament of the country, lamented: “We are more divided than ever because of the activities and policies of the current APC government.”
