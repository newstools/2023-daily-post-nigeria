National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members posted to Taraba State for their one-year mandatory service have been cautioned against dabbling into local politics in their various areas of primary assignments, even as they were warned to be security conscious. The Taraba State NYSC coordinator, Anthony M. Nzoka, cautioned the corps members on Tuesday at the closing ceremony of the 2023 Batch A Stream 1 which took place in the orientation camp in Sibre, Ardo Kola Local Government Area. Urging them to remain neutral while executing election duties, he said: “I want to urge you all not to meddle in the local politics but remain neutral as you perform the election duties for a better country.” Delivering the message of the Director General of NYSC, Brig Gen Yushau Ahmed, to corps members, Nzoka admonished them to be conscious of their security, and to eschew unauthorised travel and any night travel while also warning them against acts that may compromise their security. Corps members were also advised not to take the law into their hands but instead take their complaints to the leadership of the NYSC or security operatives.
