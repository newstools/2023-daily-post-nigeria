The Director-General, National Agency for the Control of AIDS, NACA, Gambo Aliyu, has warned Nigerians against unusual behaviour on Valentine’s Day that would expose them to contracting deadly diseases like HIV. In a statement he signed, Aliyu said most people, especially young people, indulge in sexual intercourse with the opposite sex on Valentine’s Day, noting that they have misconstrued the actual meaning of Valentine’s and the purpose of celebrating the day. According to him, many people engage in risky behaviours during this period, thereby putting themselves at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. Aliyu further added that though, Valentine’s Day is important in people’s lives globally, it brings a lot of cause to worry as the expression of love, especially among adolescents, youths, and other diverse populations, most often fall out of context. He urged the youth to express love within the context of caring deeply for their loved ones with the intention of protecting them from all forms of harm and avoiding risks that would make them vulnerable to HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.
