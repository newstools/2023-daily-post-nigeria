Paris Saint-Germain president, Nasser al Khelaifi and Chelsea co-owner, Todd Boehly had a meeting in Paris on Tuesday, to discuss a potential transfer of Neymar, ESPN reports. PSG tried to sell the Brazil forward last summer but could not find a club willing to buy him. Neymar, who turned 31 last week, is under contract with the Ligue 1 champions until June 2027. Boehly was offered the chance to recruit Neymar last summer, but a move never materialized although the American was tempted. Al Khelaifi and Boehly met for lunch and in addition to a possible move for Neymar, the pair discussed the failed transfer of Hakim Ziyech from Chelsea to PSG in January.
