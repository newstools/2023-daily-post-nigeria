The Minister of Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola, says he does not see victory for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the forthcoming presidential elections. Fashola, the Director, Election Planning and Monitoring of the APC Presidential Campaign Council, made the remark at the Formal Launching of Eko O Ni Baje 10,000 Foot Soldiers for Tinubu/Shettima and Sanwo-Olu/Hamzat on Thursday in Lagos. He said that the main opposition party had been so divided to record electoral victory either in the state or at the centre in the February 25 and March 11 elections. He said that if PDP failed to beat the APC in the 2019 elections when it was united with the current presidential candidates of NNPP and Labour Party in the party, it would be impossible for the party to beat APC in forthcoming elections. “When they (PDP) were together, they were not enough to challenge us. They are now broken into three; how can the sum total of what was not enough then be enough now that they have broken it into three parts? “Politics is about numbers, but it is also about mathematics. It is a game of addition and multiplication. It is not a game of division and subtraction. “From 2019, this umbrella party that used to be one has now been divided into three. That party has divisions and subtractions, and I don’t see a way to victory (for PDP). “Tell them that the arithmetics do not add up. We must go out and use our strength now. We have the largest number of registered voters; it must count,” he said. Fashola urged the canvassers to move out and tell voters some of the reasons to allow APC to continue.
