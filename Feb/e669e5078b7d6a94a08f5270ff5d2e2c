Chelsea will not sack Graham Potter as manager despite a 1-0 defeat to Southampton on Saturday. James Ward-Prowse’s first-half free-kick proved to be the winner at Stamford Bridge. The team was booed off the pitch at the break and at full time. There were also more calls for Potter to be sacked by the club supporters. But according to the UK Telegraph, there is no change in the Chelsea board’s position on Potter. The former Brighton manager still has the backing of co-owner Todd Boehly. Chelsea are still 10th on the log with 31 points.
