Legendary Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, believes the Red Devils need to sign another striker in the summer transfer window. Ferguson said Manchester United need to bring in a new striker at the end of the season to share the goalscoring burden with forward Marcus Rashford. According to him, Rashford, who has scored 17 goals in his last 19 appearances for Erik ten Hag’s side, is currently Man United’s main source of goals this season. The Scottish said this after Rashford netted the second of Man United’s Carabao Cup final 2-0 win over Newcastle United at Wembley Stadium on Sunday. Asked about Rashford, Ferguson told Sky Sports: “I don’t think he is a striker, he operates really from the left-hand side. “But fantastic. His finishing is always good. He always keeps his shots down, which is really important for a striker. “He is in a great vein of form and unfortunately for us, he’s the main source of goals. We could do with an extra one, you know. But he is doing it for us.”
