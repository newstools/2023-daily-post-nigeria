A spokesperson of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Presidential Campaign Council, PCC, Dele Momodu has provided an update on the crisis rocking the party. The crisis involves five Governors of the party, known as the G-5, and led by Rivers State helmsman Nyesom Wike. In doing this, Momodu compared the crisis in the All Progressives Congress, APC, as a World War when juxtaposed to what is going on in the PDP which, according to is just a civil war. The former presidential candidate wondered why an APC Governor like Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State and others could publicly attack their own government on the national level. Speaking in an interview with Arise Television, on Monday, Momodu said, “Wike has been fighting his political party ever since the What we have in PDP is a civil war while what is happening in APC is World War. “Where Governors are attacking their own President; attacking the leadership of their party frontally. “In PDP, yes five people, one of them aggrieved that he lost the election, that’s normal. “Some people lose elections and go away quietly while some lose elections and become inconsolable. So Wike has been inconsolable. “We’ve been trying to console, advise and plead with him but he has refused and it’s his choice. “But in APC what you have is volcanic eruption. They’re fighting as if Buhari is already out of power. Gov El-Rufai threatened that once Tinubu wins we’re going to reverse the policies of Buhari. I’ve never heard such a thing in my life.”
