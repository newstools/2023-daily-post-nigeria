Arsenal legend, Thierry Henry, has snubbed Paris Saint-Germain’s Lionel Messi and named former Gunners hero Dennis Bergkamp as the best player he has played with in his career. Henry stated this while covering the UEFA Champions League on CBS Sports. The Frenchman was a former teammate of Messi during their time together at Barcelona. The former striker also played with Bergkamp during their time at Arsenal. Along with Henry, Liverpool legend, Jamie Carragher and former Manchester United defender, Micah Richards were also asked about the best players they played with during their respective careers. While Carragher named Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard, Richards was quick to pick Manchester City legend, Yaya Toure. However, when presenter, Kate Abdo asked Henry to pick his choice, the 45-year-old quickly replied: “Dennis Bergkamp.” Abdo questioned back, asking: “Not Messi?” But Henry, however, was not interested in elaborating and replied back: “Is it quickfire?”
