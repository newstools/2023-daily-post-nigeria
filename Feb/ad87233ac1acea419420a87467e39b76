The Director General of the National Youth Service Corps, NYSC, Brigadier General Yusha’u Dogara Ahmed has advised Corps Members to be security conscious as they go about their assignments. He also told the corps members to try to acquire vocational skills through the NYSC Skill Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development programme. The DG noted that many NYSC members who embraced the programme some years ago are now ripping the fruits. He said this while addressing Corps members at the Kano State Orientation Camp in Kusala Dam-Karaye. “Be security conscious, believe in yourself, and wherever you are posted, God will help you realize your dreams there. Please don’t allow anyone to change your destiny”, he said. The newly sworn-in Director-General met a total of 1,437 Corps Members, 730 males and 707 females at the camp.
