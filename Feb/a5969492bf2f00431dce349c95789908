Veteran Nigerian actor and spokesperson for the Labour Party Presidential Campaign Council, Kenneth Okonkwo has revealed why going to court to challenge the presidential election results is an absolute waste of time. Recall that the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, had tasked parties aggrieved with the presidential election result to go to court to challenge it if they were unsatisfied. This is coming after the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, agent, Dino Melaye and other parties agents on Monday staged a walkout at the national collation centre in Abuja over INEC’s delay in uploading the election results to the election results viewing portal (IRev). Reacting to this in a series of tweets on his Twitter handle on Tuesday, Okonkwo said, “Any Nigerian who thinks he will get justice in a court against a Muslim-Muslim ticket forcefully foisted on Nigerians in a country where the President, Vice President, Senate President, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, National Chairman of the Party and the Chief Justice of Nigeria were Muslim is ignorant of the Machina treatment. ”This is a government that can’t give poor Muslims like Bashir Machina justice, and some ignorant Christians believe they will receive justice from such a government,” he asked.
