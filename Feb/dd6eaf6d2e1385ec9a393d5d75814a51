Nnamdi Azikiwe University Business School has revealed that it is holding training for appointees of the Anambra State governor, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, and traders in Onitsha Main Market. The director of the school, Prof. Emma Okoye said the institution has secured a spacious and serene facility in Onitsha where the training will hold. He added that the training will be centred mostly on teaching the traders Chinese and French languages, to facilitate the efficient delivery of their businesses with international partners. According to him: “The international businesses that most of these traders do entail doing businesses in French and Chinese languages. So, because they do not speak these languages, they are, most times, cheated by their business partners or [have to] rely on their interpreters. “We have decided to train them for three months, and the turnout has not been very encouraging because an average Igbo man still has reservations about university education. There is apprehension and fear in them, but we are waiting to get the required number because the leadership of the market has shown keen interest in the programme.” Okoye added: “In a bid to deliver world-class learning experience for short-term certificate programmes, we entered into collaboration with the Centre for Regional and International Development (CRID), based in Canada and the United Kingdom, and other organisations.” An associate professor in the institution and Deputy Director of Unizik Business School, Dr Chinedu Onyeizugbe who spoke on the training of Soludo’s appointees said Unizik Business School hopes to enhance the capacity of the appointees, to be able to perform optimally. “We also offer a course on Governance and Legislative Studies at PhD level. We are offering flexible courses that will help people to enhance themselves. It may interest you that we do not go on strike, so people can take this opportunity,” he said.
