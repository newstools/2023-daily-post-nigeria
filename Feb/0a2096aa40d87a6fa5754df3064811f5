Newcastle United will be without Nick Pope for the Carabao Cup final against Manchester United. Pope was shown a straight card against Liverpool on Saturday. The England goalkeeper was dismissed for handling the ball outside the area with Mohammed Salah putting him under pressure. Newcastleâ€™s third-choice goalkeeper Loris Karius is now in line to make his first senior appearance in two years at Wembley. Manager Eddie Howe brought on second-choice keeper Martin Dubravka to replace Pope. But Dubravka is not eligible for the Carabao Cup final because he made two appearances in the earlier rounds of the competition while on loan at United.
