One of the spokespersons for the Bola Tinubu, Shettima Presidential Campaign Council, Festus Keyamo on Sunday said the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has gone into political epilepsy. Keyamo said PDP developed epilepsy due to President Muhammadu Buhari’s endorsement of the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. Lately, there have been insinuations of crisis between Buhari and Tinubu. Tinubu had accused some elements in Buhari’s government of trying to sabotage his presidential ambition. The APC flag bearer said the fuel scarcity and naira redesign was targeted at him by some people in the Presidential Villa. Despite the claims, Buhari had vowed to continue campaigning for Tinubu, while urging Nigerians to vote for him. The president spoke during the APC presidential campaign in Lafia, Nasarawa State. However, Keyamo said Buhari’s endorsement of Tinubu was affecting the PDP. In a tweet, Keyamo wrote: “Since the event in Lafia where President Buhari endorsed @officialABAT unequivocally. “The PDP has gone into a fit of political epilepsy, calling press conferences & issuing incoherent statements. This is like a game of cards. We have just brought our trump card to say ‘check-up.”
