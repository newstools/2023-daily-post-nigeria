The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Thursday re-arraigned four men before a Lagos High Court in Ikeja for alleged purchase and possession of forged U.S. dollars. The defendants, Mark Obisean, Olumide Mcintouch, Bolaji Bakare and Goodluck Bazunu were re-arraigned on an amended 11-count charge bordering on purchasing forged bank notes and conspiracy to purchase forged bank notes. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The EFCC counsel, Mr Nwandu Ukoha, asked the court for a trial date to enable the prosecution to call its witnesses and tender relevant documents to prove the case against them. Counsel to the first defendant, Mr Bolaji Ayorinde, SAN, however, informed the court of the bail application filed on behalf of his client, whom he argued did not constitute a flight risk. Counsel for the other defendants, on the other hand, had no formal bail applications before the court for the court to hear and rule on. Justice Ismail Ijelu, while ruling on the bail application, admitted the first defendant to N20 million bail with two sureties in like sum. Ijelu ordered the remaining defendants remanded in a correctional facility pending the filing and hearing of bail application. The case has been adjourned till April 3 for trial.
