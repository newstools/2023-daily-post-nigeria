Former senator representing Adamawa Central senatorial district, Abdul-Aziz Nyako said grassroots development laws would receive legislative attention in the 10th National Assembly because of the peculiarities of their challenges. Nyako who is the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the 2023 general election spoke at a town hall meeting held at WEEIN Hall Jimeta, Yola on Sunday. The interactive session was a platform for the electorate in the senatorial zone to air their views, during which the former lawmaker assured that grassroots development is important because of its benefits to the people. To have a development that has a direct bearing on the people, Nyako said, it must be mainstreamed through legislative activity which he will be committed to if he returns to the Red Chamber of the 10th National Assembly. According to him, if lawmaking becomes an Act, it has a direct and lasting effect on the people more than projects executed. He further told the constituents that project execution is the direct responsibility of the executives and not lawmakers, noting that the reverse is the case, thereby placing lawmakers in a tight corner and at variance with their constituents. He cited the case of the North East Development Commission, NEDC, and the Federal medical centres as good examples of laws that became acts that last longer. “When you make law, it becomes an act and it last longer,” Nyako insisted. Earlier, the chairman of the planning committee of the town hall meeting, Dauda Marcus Gundiri, advocated for collective ideas that will help the senator to perform well if elected.
