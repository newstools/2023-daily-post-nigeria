The MD/CEO CashToken Africa, Lai Labode was effusive in praise of the partnership he said will impact the lives of Nigerians, one cash token at a time. “It is sustainable because every time a customer patronizes 9mobile, they become more prosperous, and what 9mobile is doing is sharing a part of that prosperity with Nigerians. “I need you to imagine what it is for a 9mobile customer in Okokomaiko who has been purchasing airtime to receive a cash token of N10,000,000. It is a big deal,” Labode enthused. Every recharge of N1000 for existing customers or N200 for new customers earns the customer one CashToken. Cumulative credit recharge to the limit of N1000 for existing subscribers and N200 for new ones within a month also qualifies for the reward. Every CashToken generates an instant cash-back of N6 and is an entry into the National CashToken draws every Saturday at 9:00 pm on the AIT network. Subscribers can enter multiple times to increase their chances of winning. For every N1000 spent on data or airtime purchases, customers automatically get an entry into the weekly National CashToken Draw. Customers must dial *6700*09# to enroll on the CashToken platform before they can enjoy these benefits and can view and redeem their CashToken balances anytime by dialing *6700#. Accumulated CashTokens can be redeemed as 9mobile airtime/data or to pay for transactions with over 200 participating merchant platforms.
