The African Democratic Congress, ADC, has endorsed Peter Obi, Labour Party presidential candidate for the Saturday poll. The development is sequel to the formation of a grand coalition, which aims at propelling Obi and his running mate, Datti Baba-Ahmed for the nationâ€™s top job. The endorsement was held at the River Plate Gardens in Abuja on Monday morning. The coalition, which is made up of several star alliance partners such as Nigeria Mothers for Good Governance, Fulani United, and League of Imams, among others, said they seek to create a formidable force for the Obi-Datti ticket. The event was attended by prominent figures such as the ADC National Chairman, Chief Raphael Nwosu, BoT Chairman, Dr Mani Ibrahim Ahmed and Prof Pat Utomi.
