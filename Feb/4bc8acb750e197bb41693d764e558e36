The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi, has promised that his administration will respect the rule of law if he is voted into power. Obi gave the assurance during a town hall meeting, organised by the Imo chapter of the party on Thursday in Owerri. He further reaffirmed his commitment to a new Nigeria that would work for and accommodate everyone, irrespective of tribe, religion or other inclinations. He assured Nigerians that electing him as president would help to unite the country and bring an end to poverty, suffering and insecurity. His emergence, he said, would open the way for the country’s economic emancipation. “My government will work closely with state governments to build uncommon synergy, with the aim of all-inclusive governance for the overall good of all the citizens. Nigeria is blessed, we have all it takes to be a great country,” Obi stated. He said further: “All we need is the right leadership that will harness our potential as a country, such as the oil and gas in Imo, for our collective benefit. I will ensure respect for rule of law, secure and unite Nigeria and move the country from consumption to production. Vote for Labour Party, vote for human beings: papa, mama, pikin.”
