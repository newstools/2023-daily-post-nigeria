Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has pinpointed one mistake made by Graham Potter during Chelsea’s frustrating 1-1 draw in the Premier League against West Ham United on Saturday. Ferdinand believes that how Potter handled a crucial moment in the game and the handball drama, clearly showed the manager’s lack of experience. He said the likes of Jose Mourinho, Pep Guardiola or Liverpool’s Jurgen Klopp would never have made such mistakes. With the score level at 1-1 and just a minute to the stoppage time, the Blues were denied what appeared to be a clear penalty when Tomas Soucek blocked Conor Gallagher’s shot with his arm. Addressing the press after the match Potter was asked about the incident and the Englishman, who was clearly not interested in dwelling on the matter, said, “These are the little things you need to go in your favour and at the moment they are not so that’s life there is nothing to complain about.” Rio Ferdinand pointed out that former Blues boss, Mourinho would have made the incident the back page headlines on Sunday while Guardiola and Klopp would have also handled the situation differently. Ferdinand told BT Sport: ‘It comes with experience, if you look at a Pep Guardiola or Klopp or Mourinho in years gone by at Chelsea, Mourinho would have been out there in the presser tomorrow and that would’ve been the story, the back page would’ve been Mourinho slams VAR and takes the focus off what happens on the pitch.”
