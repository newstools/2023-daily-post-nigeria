Biggie had instructed that behind the line, each pair rep had 3 minutes to throw three balls at the target board. At the end of the round, the Royal and Maya emerged finalists. They were then instructed to flip the cups one by one using their fingers. Biggie said the cups had to flip onto the next cup, and had to land in an upright position or upside down. The Royals won the game and emerged HoH. Meanwhile, Jaypee and Lukay were evicted during the live show on Sunday.
