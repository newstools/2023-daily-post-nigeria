The Labour Party, LP, has called for the removal of Olusegun Agbaje, the Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, in Lagos State. The party urged the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to do so before the general elections starting on February 25. A spokesperson for Peter Obi Campaign Organisation, Kenneth Okonkwo made the demand in a Twitter post on Monday. “If Prof Mahmood Yakubu doesn’t sack Olusegun Agbaje now, then Nigerians must realise that Prof Mahmood has decided to rig the election of 2023 in favour of APC,” he tweeted. Okonkwo accused Agbaje of referring to the people of South-East origin based in Lagos as immigrants in their country. He said the REC denied Igbos the collection of their Permanent Voter’s Cards, PVCs, “while foreigners from Niger Republic, Chad, etc were given PVCs and NINs in El-Rufai’s Kaduna State”. The Nollywood veteran stated that “Nigerians have lost confidence in any election that will be conducted by this ethnic and confused bigot”. Okonkwo said Agbaje is “suffering from impaired reasoning like the principal he is working for who has commanded his followers to snatch power at all costs”. The LP chieftain further charged Nigerians to insist the right thing is done “starting with the firing of Olusegun Agbaje.” The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar last week asked INEC to remove Agbaje.
