Former Manchester defender, Danny Simpson, has urged his former club to sign former Red Devils forward, Wilfried Zaha, in the summer transfer window to partner Marcus Rashford in the team’s attack line. According to Simpson, Zaha’s combination with Rashford is firepower. Zaha, who currently plays for Crystal Palace, is out of contract at the end of the season. The Ivorian is yet to pen a new deal at Crystal Palace and he is unlikely to stay with Patrick Vieira’s side after the end of the current campaign. Zaha has been linked with a move to Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal, respectively. “I would bring him back here. If you are looking at Marcus Rashford as the No. 9 and Wilfried on the left, that is some firepower. It was Sir Alex Ferguson who signed him then he left. Moyes obviously came in and it didn’t work out,” Simpson told Stadium Astro. “I do genuinely believe if Sir Alex was the manager when he signed, we would have seen a different Wilfried Zaha at Manchester United.”
