Real Madrid head coach, Carlo Ancelotti, is reportedly keen on getting rid of €40 million rated defender, Ferland Mendy. As per Diario GOL, Ancelotti is ‘fed up’ with Mendy’s attitude at Real Madrid and has informed the club’s board to sell him in the summer transfer window. The report added that the former Chelsea and Everton manager has lost patience with the French left-back and does not want him in his squad next season. The Italian has not used Mendy regularly since his arrival at Santiago Bernabeu and has even played centre-back Antonio Rudiger in the left-back position. Paris Saint-Germain were linked with Mendy earlier this season and are said to be still interested in the 27-year-old. The Parisians were willing to offer €40million to Real Madrid for Mendy’s signature and could return with the offer at the end of the season. Mendy has played 14 La Liga matches for Los Blancos so far this season but has not convinced Ancelotti.
