Former Manchester United midfielder, Owen Hargreaves, has named N’Golo Kante as the player who can solve Chelsea’s problems this season. The former England international believes Kante could help Chelsea to turn around their poor run of form this season, adding that the France international makes teams better. Chelsea have had a tough 2022/23 season, as they are languishing in 10th position in the Premier League table. Speaking to Premier League Productions, Hargreaves said: “I think if Kante comes back… Every team he plays, he makes it better, whether it is Leicester, Chelsea, or France. “If they can find a way to get him back fit, that’ll make a huge difference. That covers up a lot of the issues [for Chelsea].” Kante has missed the majority of the ongoing season after he sustained a hamstring injury in their 2-2 draw against Tottenham Hotspur last August.
