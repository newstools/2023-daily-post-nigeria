Al-Nassr forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, has expressed happiness after scoring his first goal for the club in a competitive match. Ronaldo nets his first goal to help Al Nassr move back to the top of the table as they drew 2-2 against Al Fateh on Friday. After making an inexplicable mistake, hitting the goal post, having a goal disallowed for offside and missing two clear chances, Ronaldo finally managed to get his name on the scoresheet, as Al Nassr drew 2-2 against Al Fateh in the 15th round of the Saudi Arabian League. The former Manchester United star was the player who made it 2-2 from the spot five minutes into the second half’s stoppage time to help his team snatch a point. His teammate, Talisca, also got his name on the scoresheet. Reacting, Ronaldo, in a tweet via his Twitter handle after the game, also hailed his teammates for their display against Al Fateh. Ronaldo tweeted, “Happy to have scored my first goal in the Saudi league and great effort by whole team to achieve an important draw in a very difficult match!”
