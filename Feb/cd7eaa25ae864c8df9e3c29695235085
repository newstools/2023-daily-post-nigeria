Barely seven days to the presidential election, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has urged Northerners to vote the Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate, Peter Obi. Okechukwu Isiguzoro, the Secretary-General of Ohanaeze, said Northerners should choose Obi ahead of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. Isiguzoro said Northerners and Nigerians in general should unite together for the greater future of the country by voting for Obi. In a statement he signed, Isiguzoro said Nigerians should save themselves from corruption and mess by voting Obi instead of Atiku. According to Isiguzoro: “There is an ongoing battle between the corrupt elites and President Buhari, as there are attempts to bend the President to accept the elites’ covetousness and allow a particular unpopular candidate to win the 2023 Presidential election. “The North should know that it’s only Peter Obi will salvage the myriad of problems in the North and resuscitate the dwindling fortunes of the North. “Those who are aged, without the stamina will not be able to do the work rather than helping the north, they will aggravate and worsen the situation.” Isiguzoro urged Northerners to shun ethnicity and religious cards in deciding Nigeria’s next president. He added: “Northerners should shun ethnicity and religion cards and choose competence, capacity, and character in the bid to end insecurity and banditry in the North. “We are begging the Northerners to choose Peter Obi ahead of Atiku and Tinubu to save the country from total collapse.”
