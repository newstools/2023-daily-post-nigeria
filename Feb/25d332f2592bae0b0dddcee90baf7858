All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has hailed President Muhammadu Buhari for abiding by the tenure limit. The former governor gave the commendation on Monday at the Yoruba Leaders of Thought summit in Lagos. Tinubu assured the gathering that he was prepared for the February 25 election and confident of victory. He said the journey was never meant to be easy, and to become President out of 200 million people “you have to keep working and working”. On stipulated terms of office, Tinubu noted that Buhari is different from an individual who sought to remain in office against what the law specifies. “We should thank President Buhari for keeping his words to handover power when he is done, not like “someone” that wanted to extend his stay,” he stated. The APC flagbearer recalled his visits to states across the country, describing the campaigns and other demands as challenging. Tinubu thanked organisers for the event, disclosing he expected most people to have left the venue because he arrived late. The frontrunner urged his supporters to come out en masse with their family and friends to vote for him and to vote for APC. “By the Grace of God, all the prayers will be answered and we shall be victorious at the end of the day”, he added.
