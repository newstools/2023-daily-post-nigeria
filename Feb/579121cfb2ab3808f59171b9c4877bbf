Flying Eagles head coach, Ladan Bosso praised his players for executing their plans in the win against Mozambique on Saturday night. The West Africans zoomed into the quarter-finals following a 2-0 victory against the Young Mambas at the Suez Canal Stadium, Ismailia. Samson Lawal and Ibrahim Muhammad scored two sublime goals for Bosso’s side in the first half. The seven–time champions finished in second position in Group A behind the Cubs of Senegal.
“We worked for it. We have seen them play about two matches in Cairo,” Bosso said during his interaction with the media. “We tried to rush them and we did just that and got our two goals in the first half. The second half we introduced other players preparing them for the next stage.” The Flying Eagles will discover their quarter-final opponent on Monday.
