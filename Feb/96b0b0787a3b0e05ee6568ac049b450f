Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai has accused the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Godwin Emefiele of economic sabotage due to poor implementation of the Naira redesign policy. He said the policy was designed ab initio to frustrate Nigerians. El-Rufai made this disclosure on Thursday in a live broadcast in Kaduna while addressing citizens on the currency crisis. He explained that CBN’s admittance of printing N400 billion new naira notes in a banking system where it mopped N2.1 trillion old naira notes early February, indicates economic sabotage. He stated that President Muhammadu Buhari had been lied to about the capacity of Nigerian Security Printing and Minting, NSPMC. He agreed with economic experts who said Nigeria needs over 2 trillion cash in circulation, stating that N700 billion benchmarked by the CBN for ‘cashless policy’ needs to be revised. El-Rufai said, “The CBN informed the President at the beginning that the Mint (NSPMC) has enough capacity to print the needed currency in circulation within the 6-week timeframe for the so-called ‘cash swap’. “By its admission, only N400bn worth of new notes had been printed for CBN in early February. The current cash shortage was therefore designed from the beginning. The President was lied to about the domestic capacity of the Mint to print, and even if the announced N700bn was printed, it would have been grossly inadequate anyway. Imagine printing only N400bn and making most of it unavailable to the banks but passed to favoured entities through special arrangements. How can the CBN collect N2.1 trillion from citizens and print only N400bn? Is this not a clear case of economic sabotage?”. El-Rufai was reacting to Buhari’s Thursday pronouncement on the Naira redesign policy and the ongoing currency crisis Nigerians are experiencing.
