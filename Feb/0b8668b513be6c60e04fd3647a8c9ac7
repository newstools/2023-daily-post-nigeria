The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu has denied stockpiling new naira notes ahead of the presidential election. Tinubu was reacting to an allegation by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, alleging he was mopping up new naira notes for vote-buying. Speaking through his Special Adviser on Media and Public Affairs, Mahmud Jega, Tinubu described the allegation as false. A statement by Jega reads: “We are not surprised that the PDP made a volte-face to conjure a completely unfounded allegation against Tinubu. “Having realized that Atiku’s selfish, uncaring position has generated popular anger and resentment against him, it came up with this absurd claim that our candidate is mopping up new currency notes. We want to assure Nigerians that claim is utterly false.” The statement said Tinubu was speaking for the voiceless in his campaigns by calling for the extension of the naira swap deadline.
