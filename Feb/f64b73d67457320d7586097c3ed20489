The New Nigeria Peoples Party NNPP has said the future of Nigeria lies in the hands of the youths. NNPP gubernatorial candidate in Jigawa State, Malam Aminu Ibrahim Ringim stated this while addressing the party’s supporters at a rally in Babura local Government on Tuesday. He said for the whole eight years of the APC’s administration Nigerians have been going through unique adversity including, hunger, poverty, insecurity, and others. “APC administration has deliberately put Nigerians in a state of poverty and hunger to take that advantage and distribute money to the voters on Election Day” “Whenever they give you money collect and think about the eight years of APC’s bad governance and the difficult situation they have put Nigerians and vote wisely for the brighter future of the country” He said youths are the key actors in championing change in every society, therefore, it was high time for them to salvage the country from the present predicament. “The future of this country lies in your hands, therefore it is a higher time you rescue Nigerians from the current hardship deliberately created by the APC’s administration,” Ringim said. He said the NNPP candidates have the required experience and political will to change the country for the better. Ringim, however, reiterated the party’s commitment to rebuilding the country’s economy and changing the insecurity situation for the betterment of Nigerians when given the mandate in the 2023 general election.
