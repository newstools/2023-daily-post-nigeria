A group known as Civil Society Organization has accused governors of the All Progressives Party, APC, of plotting to cause chaos in Nigeria over the naira redesign policy implementation. The group convener, Obed Okwukwe said this during a press conference in Abuja on Tuesday. He disclosed that these governors would orchestrate intensified cash scarcity to frustrate the Naira redesign policy. “Unfortunately, these governors have sworn allegiance to their new Godfather. They are willing to disobey constitutional governance and do anything, including creating anarchy, to enthrone him. “There will be intensified cash scarcity; there will be drama across the geo-political zones in the country, people will pretend to collapse in marketplaces, banks and ATMs over the Naira redesign policy”. For weeks now, Nigerians have continued to suffer hardship over the nationwide cash crunch owing to the non-availability of the new naira notes. Last week, the Supreme Court restrained the central bank of Nigeria from implementing the February 10 deadline to phase out the old naira notes pending a substantive hearing on Wednesday.
