The Supreme Court said the candidates who emerged from the primaries conducted by the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led faction of the Edo Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, are authentic. Justice Centus Nweze’s judgment on Wednesday brings to an end the legal battle to determine the camp in control of the state chapter. The other faction, the Legacy Group of the PDP, is led by National Vice Chairman, Dan Orbih. Delivering the judgment in the appeal filed by Omoregie Ogbeide-Ihama and others against Mathew Iduoriyekemwen and others, the apex court held that the case was faulty. Justice Nweze said it did not emanate from the judgement of the appellate court, dismissing the appeal on the grounds of incompetence. The ruling set aside the judgment of the Appeal Court which was in favour of candidates belonging to the Legacy Group. The judge held that an appeal must be based on issues contended at the lower court to qualify for review. “Any ground of appeal that does not challenge issues raised at the lower court is incompetent. I enter judgment in favour of the respondents,” said Justice Nweze. The outcome means the candidates of the Obaseki-led faction will stand for the National Assembly and State House of Assembly elections on March 11.
