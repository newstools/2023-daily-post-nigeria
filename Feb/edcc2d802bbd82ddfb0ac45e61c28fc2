Operatives of Osun Amotekun corps have arrested a 41-year-old man, Temitope Olojede for suspected theft. Olojede was arrested on Thursday after operatives received a distress call from residents that he had robbed a church at the Ogo-Oluwa area of Osogbo. Confirming the arrest to journalists in Osogbo on Saturday, the Osun Amotekun Corps Commander, Brigadier General Bashir Adewinmbi described the suspect as a known culprit who has been terrifying the residents of Ogo-Oluwa Area, Osogbo. “Our men received a distress call from one of the residents of Ogo-Oluwa that a church was burgled and they needed the attention of the operatives urgently to arrest the felon; they swung into action immediately and he was arrested after trying to circumvent the scene. “During investigation, he confessed to being in the act for a very long time and that he has been stealing from the area and its environs,” Adewinmbi asserted.
