He said that the operations started on Friday and the bandits continued their nefarious activities till Saturday, saying that the kidnapped victims were taken to the forest. “Innocent passengers on their way to attend the annual Islamic Maulud were abducted by the notorious bandits. Passengers of two commercial vehicles were kidnapped by the terrorists in between Yandoton Daji and Kwatarkwashi”, he said. He further stated that some residents of Tsafe were also attacked by the bandits on Friday along Yandoton Daji-Gidan Dawa, adding that the victims narrowly escaped as a result of the quick intervention of the military operatives.
