The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Plateau State, Caleb Mutfwang has reassured citizens of the state that his administration will restore peace and prosperity in the state if he wins the forthcoming election. He promised competent leadership that will run an all-inclusive government and pave way for justice and equity for all. Mutfwang stated this during town hall meetings in Quaan Pan and Mikang local government areas in the state’s southern senatorial zone. While he promised to provide purposeful leadership that would restore the dignity of Plateau citizens, he also pledged to secure the state by reviving the state-owned security outfit, Operation Rainbow. The governorship candidate further said deliberate steps would be taken to empower rural communities, local vigilantes and hunters, to complement the effort of conventional security agencies in the state. He avowed further that youths, women, and people living with disabilities will occupy a strategic place in his administration if elected into office to fix the state’s economy. On skills acquisition and improvement, Mutfwang said his administration shall revive institutions like the School of Relevant Technology to help with that process, along with making mechanized farming profitable and attractive to the people.
