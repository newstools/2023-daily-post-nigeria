President Muhammadu Buhari has arrived Katsina State from where he would proceed to Daura, his home town to participate in Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections. Buhari’s aircraft landed at the Umaru Musa Yar’ Adua Airport, Katsina at exactly 4:40 pm. He is expected to cast his vote for his preferred candidates in Daura later on Saturday. Prior to leaving Abuja for Katsina, on Thursday, Buhari had summoned a Security Council Meeting, where he met with heads of security agencies to intimate them on the need to protect electorates and ensure the elections are hitch-free. Buhari had also met with the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Prof. Mahmood Yakubu in Abuja, where he had admonished him to ensure the elections are free, fair and credible. He was also present at the International Conference Centre Abuja, on Wednesday, where he witnessed candidates participating in the 2023 presidential election signing a peace accord. At the event, Buhari had charged all the candidates contesting in the elections to accept the outcome of the elections as the choice of the electorates. In the build up to the elections, Buhari, who is serving out his last term as President, had repeatedly said he would bequeath an electoral process that would be adjudged credible and transparent. The President had in February 2022 signed the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law. Buhari became President in 2015 after defeating his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan in a keenly contested election. He rode to power on the platform of the All Progressive Congress (APC), a party that got its formation in February 2013, from a merger involving the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), and the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) along with a breakaway faction of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). Buhari is expected to hand over the baton of leadership to his successor on May 29, 2023.
