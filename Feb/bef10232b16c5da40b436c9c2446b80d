The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission, ICPC, has secured the conviction of Mr Ojoko Robinson, a director with Rojoke CNE Services Limited, and the company for contract fraud to the tune of N13, 710, 252.44. According to a statement on Friday by ICPC spokesperson, Azuka Ogugua, the anti-corruption agency had filed a seven-count charge against Robinson and the company before Hon. Justice N. O. Dimgba of the Federal High Court, Asaba Judicial Division, on allegations bordering on forgery. ICPC in suit No. FHC/ASB/3C/2022 informed the court of how the defendants used forged documents in bidding and securing two World Bank contracts, contravening Section 1(2) (c) of the Miscellaneous Offences Act, CAP M17, LFN 2004. Having listened to both augments, the trial judge found the defendants guilty on all counts, as the prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. In handing down his judgment, Justice Dimgba ruled that the defendants should refund 25 per cent of the benefits derived from the contracts to the World Bank through the Asaba office of the ICPC. The trial Judge further ordered the 1st defendant, who is an Information Technology expert, to teach Information Communication Technology (ICT) at the Delta State ICT Hub, Asaba for two years at his own expense. The 1st defendant is to work out a programme with the management of the ICT Hub within two weeks from the date of the judgment and file a notice of compliance with the registrar of the court. The judge also ruled that the 1st defendant, having been sent for training on integrity by the World Bank, is to deliver regular talks on integrity to final-year students in three secondary schools (two in Asaba and one in his hometown) and file progress reports every three months with the registrar of the court.
