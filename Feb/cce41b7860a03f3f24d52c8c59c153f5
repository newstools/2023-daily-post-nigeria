In a rare show of loyalty, President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday in Daura, Katsina State, displayed his ballot paper, with a thumbprint for the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. DAILY POST reports this in a statement by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to Buhari. According to him, “President Buhari, who cast his vote alongside his wife, Mrs Aisha Buhari and other family members, at Ward A, Sarkin Yara Polling Unit, 003, said it was a pity that only one female emerged as the gubernatorial candidate of the APC, Aisha Ahmed Binani, urging support for the candidate. “The President assured that he had always supported the candidature of Asiwaju Tinubu, and the show of his ballot paper to the media and the public further shows his commitment to the party and the national leader. “I am very impressed because I have seen how the people turned up. I am very impressed and very happy. Well, the candidate I voted for I have already mentioned in many states in Nasarawa, Katsina and Sokoto. “All over the place, I mentioned my favourite candidate, Asiwaju Tinubu, and I believe my constituency will elect him 100 per cent,” he said. “President Buhari advised Nigerians to ensure that their rights to vote were always respected. “Nigerians should ensure that they are respected; that means that the candidate they want to vote for is allowed to vote for him. “It is a pity there is only one female candidate from Adamawa State, so the electorate should kindly follow our party,” he added. “The fourth time I said ‘God dey’, and God sent technology, Permanent Voters Card, so no fraudulent person can claim anything,” he stated. “According to the President, “APC will win, from Daura to Lagos.”The President’s family members and staff also voted at the polling unit”, the statement reads.
