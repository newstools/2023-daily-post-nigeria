The All Progressives Congress, APC, governorship candidate for Niger State, Mohammed Bago, has said the problem posed by the scarcity of naira and fuel is “generic.” This was as Bago said the new naira policy does not affect politicians who have money. Lately, Nigerians have been lamenting over the scarcity of the naira following the new policy initiated by the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN. But, speaking in Abuja, Bago maintained that the fuel scarcity is sabotage, adding that the Federal Government should prevail on supervising agencies to ensure the availability of the product. According to Bago: “People who are advising for the redesign of the naira and the implementation of the policy are not being considerate of the plight of the people. Politicians who have money are not raising funds, so they don’t care whether you change money or you don’t change money. “The fuel scarcity is purely sabotage and there is a need for the government of the day to make sure that it enforces or put agencies in charge of this industry at work so that there will be the availability of fuel.” Bago also vowed to provide security, infrastructure and socio-economic development in the state if elected governor.
