The Veteran Organisation for Human Rights (VOHR), a human rights organisation, has expressed worries over the continuous cases of sexual molestation in the country. The group is also seeking justice for victims of rape. Tunde Badmus, the President of the group, who disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday in Osogbo, also expressed sadness over the rape incidence that occurred at the Abayomi area of Ibadan, Oyo State, on Monday. Badmus, who said issues of sexual defilement and domestic violence in the country were getting out of hand, added that it had become necessary for governments at all levels to take drastic solutions to ensure such heinous acts were curtailed. In his words, “An innocent young woman wearing purdah was attacked, raped, assaulted and mogged at Abayomi Area, Iwo Road, Ibadan and attempt to cover up the ugly incidence has generated a lot of concern for our organisation. “The perpetrator’s father is well known and several attempts to cover up the morally repugnant and immorally obvious act are ongoing.” “We want the whole world and other human rights bodies to know about this incident in order to ensure the victim gets justice,” Badmus said. Badmus revealed that a popular Islamic scholar, Sheikh Sulayman Amubieya had held a peace walk to demand justice for the victim who was raped. He said the name of the perpetrator was identified as Idris Idris, popularly called “Kesari Rekereke” by the victim.
