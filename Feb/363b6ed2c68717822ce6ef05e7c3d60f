Voting in Unit 1 ward 10, Ikot Ebom primary school, Itu LGA in Akwa Ibom State has been halted following a fracas that erupted among party agents. Voters were seen scampering for safety amid the fight as the corp members parked the election materials and stood in a corner waiting for the next line of action. The police official attached to the unit overwhelmed by the pandemonium entered a motorcycle and left the voters to their fate. It was gathered that trouble started when agents of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in the unit only made way for PDP supporters to vote while those they believed will not vote for PDP were blocked from voting. A voter who did not want his name in print explained that other voters in the queue who observed what was happening insisted on being allowed to vote for candidates of their choice but were not allowed. In an attempt to fight back, the suspected PDP thugs allegedly overpowered the voters, causing pandemonium in the unit. Meanwhile, the female police officer who left the unit earlier returned with a backup of other officers who released several canisters of teargas, dispersing the crowd and leaving the polling unit empty. Many voters who claimed not to be PDP supporters for the presidential election are now lamenting the disenfranchisement they suffered.
