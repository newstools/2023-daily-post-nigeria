A man, David Gaius has been arrested by the Adamawa State Police Command for allegedly raping his stepdaughter. The man is now being probed by the police on the charge of raping the stepdaughter on three occasions. Gaius, who resides in Unguwan Prison in the Dirma village of Dumne, Song Local Government Area, admitted committing the offence, according to the State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Suleiman Nguroje. The man, narrating how he slept with the girl three times, blamed it on the devil which he said deceived him into the act while he was drunk. He contradicted his own stance, however, when he admitted using a charm of attraction, saying that he put the charm in the meat which his victim and himself ate, to attract her. He said he first had carnal knowledge of the girl in 2020 when she was 14 years old while living in the same house with his wife and other children after the other members of the family had slept. He added that when he did it the third time recently, his wife caught him red-handed, but that she lied to her that a native doctor asked him to rape a little girl. He denied using a white handkerchief to clean his victimâ€™s private part for ritual purposes as alleged by the girl, adding that he did not rape her for ritual purposes.
