One of the spokespersons for the Bola Tinubu, Shettima Campaign Council, Festus Keyamo, has described the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, as a ‘political prostitute’. Keyamo made the statement on Sunday in a post via his verified Twitter handle. The Minister of State for Labour and Employment was reacting to a post by Dogara on his Twitter handle. Dogara had referred to President Muhammadu Buhari’s endorsement of the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu, at a campaign in Nasarawa State as a mockery. “I know that PMB loves to crack jokes but I didn’t know he will escalate it to the level of satire. Asiwaju’ll give his best to Nigeria, really? Fake certificates, fake parentage, golden triangle escapades, racketeering. No PMB, Nigeria does not deserve his best but we get the satire,” Dogara said. However, Keyamo took to his Twitter handle calling out Dogara as a wanderer and back-stabber. He wrote, “My brother and law school mate, @YakubDogara, this tweet is beneath you. You are actually pained by the support of PMB for @officialABAT, two leaders who have stayed true to their beliefs and causes, unlike the political prostitute, wanderer and back-stabber that you’ve always been.”
