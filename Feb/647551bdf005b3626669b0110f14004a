Ex-Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic PDP, Bode George has denied saying INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmoud Yakubu met with Bola Tinubu in Lagos. Circulating information claimed the electoral chief flew into Lagos Saturday night and left in a private jet owned by the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate. In a rebuttal Sunday night, George stated that the claim “must have emanated from demented souls” and was a strategy to cause confusion in the polity. “I don’t work at the Control Tower or Cargo Section of the airport. I am not an official of INEC, so how will I know the movement of INEC Chairman? “Everybody knows he is in Abuja as the Chief Returning Officer of the presidential election.” The politician recalled that after voting, he returned home with his wife to watch coverage of the election by various television stations. George said nobody could use him to score cheap political points, revealing prominent Nigerians have been calling “because of this senseless statement.” On election results, the PDP chieftain insists they should be transmitted immediately, adding that he suspects those against BVAS fabricated the comment linked to him.
