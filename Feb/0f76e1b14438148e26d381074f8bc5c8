Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State on Friday said President Muhammadu Buhari must urgently take decisive action on the current fuel and naira situation in the country. Akeredolu lamented that the crises had inflicted suffering on Nigerians. The governor stated this in a statement entitled, “The President must Intervene, Decisively, on the Crisis of Distribution of Petrol and Currency Notes,” which he signed personally. According to him, some people are out to sabotage the economy which the president must immediately find a solution to. While faulting the move of the Central Bank Governor, CBN, Godwin Emefiele, on the new notes, Akeredolu, stressed that ordinary people were affected mostly by the policy. He also maintained that the crises were targeted at harming the reputation of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, and its candidates ahead of the polls as he described the situation as a case of sabotage. According to him: “The people of this country have been compelled to live under excruciating pains occasioned, mainly, by the contrived crisis in the petroleum sector. Ordinary people are the victims. Depositors can no longer access their monies, even to feed their families. Hunger is not the anticipated result of a monetary policy. “While no reasonable person will contend with the decision of the CBN to discharge its statutory functions, the plight of the downtrodden must, however, be considered. At present, the majority of Nigerians groan under the crushing weight of these crises.”
