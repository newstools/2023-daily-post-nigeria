Presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi, on Saturday defeated Bola Tinubu in the Oniru area of Lagos State. DAILY POST confirmed official results showed Peter Obi won at the polling units on Ogunyemi Road, Water Corporation Road, Palace Road, and near Shoprite. The All Progressives Congress, APC, candidate lost despite the dominance of the ruling party in previous elections. However, the exercise went smoothly but was disrupted at two locations: the unit near the Palace of Oniru, and the unit on Ogunyemi Road. Video recordings posted on social media revealed how the process was interrupted until the police arrived, allowing the votes to be counted. After another round of violence, the Police Division in Maroko, about 7:20pm, moved in to secure the ballot boxes and retrieve election officials who couldn’t leave Palace Road. DAILY POST witnessed as a team of eight officers in a white patrol vehicle escorted out ballot papers, officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, and LP agents out of Oniru. The results: PU 079 Oniru LP 87 APC 22 PDP 1 Palace road Oniru PDP 7 APC 58 LP 213 Meanwhile, Adewale Ojomo, one of the youths who stood his ground as thugs invade the area has called for protection. “Hello @NigeriapolicePR @PoliceNG my life is in danger because of elections. Please come to my aid. Thugs are after my life in the Oniru vicinity. “Please help me keep tweeting till I can confirm that I’m safe as I am not. They have positioned themselves everywhere waiting for when I turn up outside. “They have sent people to my house. My wife & daughter have just moved out of the house,” he cried out via Twitter. Ojomo tweeted again at 8:10pm with a photo: “For the avoidance of doubt, this is me being ferried off in the trunk of a car to safety as I type because of my political beliefs and choices.”
