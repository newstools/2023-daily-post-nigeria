Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez has nicknamed his new team-mate Wout Weghorst ‘Bobo’, which is translated as ‘idiot’ according to SPORT. This follows Weghorts’s infamous fallout with Lionel Messi. The 2022 World Cup quarter-final clash between Argentina and Holland turned ugly after Messi and co won on penalties. Weghorst came on as a substitute with the Dutch two goals down and scored a late brace to force extra time. The game was marred by ugly scenes afterwards, with Argentina’s players taunting the Holland players after Lautaro Martinez’s winning penalty. As Weghorst waited by Messi in the tunnel – to reportedly shake the PSG star’s hand and ask for his shirt – he was told: “Que miras bobo. Anda palla,” which translates as: “What are you looking at, idiot? Clear off.” Martinez still sees the funny side and has nicknamed Weghorst ‘Bobo’ since his arrival at Old Trafford.
