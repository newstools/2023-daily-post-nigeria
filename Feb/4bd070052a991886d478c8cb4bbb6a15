Former Liverpool defender, Jamie Carragher, has admitted he was wrong about Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez. However, Carragher insists the Argentina international will still be “exposed” for his lack of height. Martinez, who won the World Cup in December, has become an important part of Erik ten Hag’s defence. There had been concerns that the defender’s 5ft 9in frame would prove costly in the Premier League. But Carragher acknowledges that Martinez has “surprised” him this year. Speaking on the Overlap Fan Debate, he said: “Lisandro Martínez has been brilliant. To be that small and play centre back, you obviously have to be a special player. “At the World Cup with Argentina, we saw him have that fight. Someone of that size will get exposed in the air – that has to happen at some stage. “Every player has weaknesses; the best players hide them or make sure they don’t get exposed. He’s a really good player and he’s surprised me the way he’s coped.”
