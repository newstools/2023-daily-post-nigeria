Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has explained why he has started Leandro Trossard against Aston Villa on Saturday. Arteta has left regular starter, Gabriel Martinelli on the bench for the match at Villa Park. According to the Gunners’ boss, he wants to bring more “energy” to his frontline. Arteta said: “Well probably it’s to give Leandro as well the chance he deserves in the starting XI. “He’s been impacting the team every time he’s been on the field and we need some changes and some energy as well in the front line.” Arsenal is looking to return to the top of the Premier League table – albeit briefly – with a win at Villa Park in the day’s early kick-off.
