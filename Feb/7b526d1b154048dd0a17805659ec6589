Palpable fear and anxiety have gripped the political camp of the Senate President, Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, as the Supreme Court is set to deliver a make or mar judgment in his struggle for the senatorial ticket of Yobe North Senatorial District. The Apex Court had last Wednesday fixed today, February 6, for final judgment in the long-drawn legal battle. At the time of this report, a retinue of political sympathisers and followers, as well as the All Progressives Congress, APC, officials in support of the Senate President have stormed the court waiting for the judgment moment to come. Our correspondent observed that apart from hundreds of politicians, many security operatives have been deployed to the court to maintain law and order before and after the landmark verdict. Ahmad Lawan, who has been in the Senate since 1999 when the democratic dispensation came on board, is battling for the Yobe North senatorial ticket with Bashir Sheriff Machina. Machina, said to be a former member of the House of Representatives, had defeated the Senate President at the Federal High Court and the Court of Appeal. At the time of filing this report, a 5- man panel of Justices of the Court to be led by Justice Centus Chima Nweze, is expected to deliver the verdict. APC, which is backing the Senate President to emerge as its senatorial candidate, filed the appeal against the judgments of the Federal High Court and Court of Appeal, which held Bashir Sheriff Machina as the partyâ€™s candidate. The APC is being represented in the fierce legal battle by Sepiribo Cromwell Peters, while Sarafa Yusuff is standing for Machina.
