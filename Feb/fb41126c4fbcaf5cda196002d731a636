Barely two weeks to the general elections, residents of Kaduna State have resorted to prayers and fasting over the various problems of insecurity and scarcity of fuel and new naira notes plaguing them and other Nigerians. Many residents on Sunday in their various churches prayed for peaceful elections and a peaceful aftermath devoid of political crisis and any form of unrest. A respondent who spoke with DAILY POST, Mrs June Moses, said in ECWA Church, “we prayed for abundant new naira notes, enough fuel to move around before, during and after elections.” Moses Audi, a Living Faith pastor at Sabon Tasha told DAILY POST the congregation spent over an hour praying for peaceful elections across the country. He said: “We prayed that every hindrance, before, during and after elections should be erased.” According to him, the congregation specifically prayed against bandits’ attacks, fuel scarcity and all forms of criminalities.” Only when voters are given the opportunity to vote, would they know that their rights have not been denied, he added. Pastor Williams Obete of Christ Glorious Ministry, Nasarawa, said: “We all prayed for peaceful elections, we also prayed for availability of new notes for people to have money to transport to their various voting centres across the state, and also, buy foods for their families.” Pastor Gbenga Ofemilole of Mountain of Fire and Miracle Ministry said the prayer point at the church was on security. “All members of the church prayed against violence during the election, because it’s only when there is peace, there would there be an election,” he said.
