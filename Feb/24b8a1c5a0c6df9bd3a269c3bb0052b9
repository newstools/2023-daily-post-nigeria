Former Manchester United star Rio Ferdinand has named the club to win the Premier League this season after Arsenal’s defeat to Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday. Sean Dyche won his first game in charge of Everton after being appointed to take over from Frank Lampard last week. The Toffees fought hard to beat their visitors who are sitting five points above Manchester City in the Premier League table. Despite the defeat on Saturday, Ferdinand still believes the Gunners can win the title but feels Mikel Arteta’s side have to fight for it. Mikel Arteta’s Gunners were pressed relentlessly by Everton’s attackers – Alex Iwobi and Amadou Onana as the league leaders struggled to create chances. James Tarkowski scored the only goal of the game to pull Everton out of the relegation zone. It is Everton’s first win in eleven games which put them 17th in the league table depending on the outcome of other matches to be played this weekend. The Gunners’ lead in the table will be reduced to just two points if Manchester City beat their opponents on Sunday. Ferdinand told BT Sport: “Arsenal, we have been sitting here all of us believing they can win this league and I put them as favourites and I still put them as favourites and edge them slightly. “It’s a real psychological test for them now though, how do they handle this bump in the road? It’s a big learning curve for them.”
