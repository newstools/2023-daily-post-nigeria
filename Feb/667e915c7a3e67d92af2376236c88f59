The Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) on Friday said it has deployed two hundred armed operatives to fight vote buying in Kano, Jigawa and Katsina States during Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections. The Kano Zonal Commander of EFCC, Farouk Dogondaji, made this known during an interview with NAN in Kano. Dogondaji said that the deployment was part of EFCC’s commitment towards ensuring transparent and credible 2023 elections in the zone. He said, “We have deployed fifty personnel to monitor the conduct of the election in Kano State, fifty in Jigawa State and fifty in Katsina State to prevent vote buying throughout the electoral process. “The remaining [fifty] officers were deployed to Malam Aminu Kano International airport in Kano and the Umaru Musa Yar’Adua Airport in Katsina.” According to Dogondaji, the commission has enough personnel on standby, adding that they are battle ready for any threat, even during and after the election. The 2023 general election will take place today, Saturday, across the 36 States in Nigeria, including the Federal Capital Territory.
