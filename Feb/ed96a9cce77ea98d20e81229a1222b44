The Zamfara State Command of the Nigeria Hunters and Forest Security Services has lamented that the State government cannot succeed in the issue of banditry without the total support of other security agencies. According to the command, only the conventional security agencies in the state can not contain the ravaging acts of the terrorists operating in the state, saying that the conventional security agencies need support of other agencies. The command noted that there are some unrecognized associations in the state that can be of great help towards ending the dastardly acts but there is no support from the state government. The council pleaded for government support, saying that upon all its efforts to assist the state government in the fight against banditry, the government was not supportive. This was disclosed during an interview with DAILY POST in Gusau, the state capital by the State Commander, Alhaji Suleiman Lawali Zurmi. According to him, the command has been working in synergy with the security agencies in the state by arresting and handing over some criminal elements to the security agencies especially the state police command for prosecution. “We have been doing our best by arresting and handing over some arrested criminal elements to the security agencies and our efforts were not being recognized by the state government,” he lamented.
