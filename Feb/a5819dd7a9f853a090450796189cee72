The Enugu State Police Command arrested two suspects, Joseph Chinenye, 39, and Onyeka Kenneth Ezeja, 29, allegedly for possessing, transacting and selling counterfeit notes of the newly redesigned naira. A statement issued on Friday by the command’s spokesperson, DSP Daniel Ndukwe, said the suspects, who reside at Iheakpu-Awka in Igbo-Eze South and Onicha Enugu-Ezike in Igbo-Eze North local government areas of the state, were caught with 180 pieces of the newly redesigned N1,000 notes which are counterfeit. Ndukwe revealed that preliminary investigation showed that the notes, which were in three separate batches, “bear the same serial numbers of A/34:282656, A/46:578759 and 8/93:852942,” while the suspects claimed to have secured the fake notes from an unidentified woman in Benin, Edo State. “In addition, they confessed to attempting to sell the notes to a POS operator, who rejected them, before [police] operatives arrested them at a filling station in Ibagwa-Aka community of Igbo-Eze LGA, where they used the notes to purchase petrol,” he stated. The Police Public Relations Officer affirmed that the suspects would be arraigned in court once investigation is concluded by the state CID. The statement reassured the public of the commitment of the Police to fish out criminal elements perpetrating such acts of economic sabotage and ensure that they are brought to book.
