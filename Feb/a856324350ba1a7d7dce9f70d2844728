President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday expressed sadness over the death of Dr Nuhu Sanusi, the first-class traditional ruler (Emir) of Dutse in Jigawa State. Buhari, in a condolence message issued by his media aide, Garba Shehu, in Abuja, described the deceased as one of Northern Nigeria’s modernising leaders. He conveyed his sympathy and that of Nigeria to the Dutse Emirate, the government and the people of Jigawa State over the sad loss. While expressing sadness on the passing of Sanuni, Buhari said, “He was instrumental to the progress Dutse had achieved in the last three decades under his watch.” He added, “He was a grassroots person who was loved by all.” Before his death, Emir Sanusi was the Chancellor of Sokoto State University.
