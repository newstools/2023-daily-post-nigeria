Senator representing Delta North Senatorial District, Peter Nwaoboshi has been rearrested after he went underground for eight months after the Court of Appeal in Lagos convicted and sentenced him to seven years imprisonment. He was convicted for money laundering to the tune of N805 million when he was Commissioner for Works in Delta State. He was reportedly picked up at a hospital in Lagos on Monday by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC and immediately whisked to Ikoyi Custodial Centre on Wednesday, February 8, 2023, to serve his prison terms. The anti-graft agency confirmed this development on its site on Wednesday.
