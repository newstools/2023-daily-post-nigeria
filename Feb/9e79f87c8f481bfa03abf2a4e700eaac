The Commissioner of Police Ebonyi State, Aliyu Garba on Saturday vowed to fish out the gunmen who attacked the gubernatorial candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, Prof Benard Odoh, at the Rest House, Okpoto community in Ishielu LGA. Recall that the driver of the APGA governorship candidate, Odoh, whose name is yet to be identified was killed during the attack. Aliyu, in a statement signed and made available to newsmen in Abakaliki by the command’s spokesperson, Chris Anyanwu, said the command responded swiftly and mobilized tactical teams who assisted the Ishielu Divisional Police team in a hot chase of the hoodlums. He confirmed that the gubernatorial candidate of APGA, Odoh, was ambushed by armed men who shot sporadically at his convoy while returning from a campaign visit. The statement reads in part: “The unfortunate incident which took place at the Rest House axis within Okpoto in Ishielu L.G.A left one of the drivers and an SPU personnel wounded with bullet injuries. He revealed that a Toyota Hilux van was burnt to ashes while another of the convoy vehicles was equally damaged by the armed men. The commissioner noted further that Odoh and all other dignitaries and party supporters escaped unscathed. He, however, stated that the Command has activated an intelligence-led investigation, headed by the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of the State Criminal Investigation/Intelligence Department, SCIID, to fish out the perpetrators of the dastardly act. Aliyu, also empathised with the party and its members over the ugly development and urged politicians to reset their campaign itineraries to avoid nocturnal movements. He further assured that the perpetrators will be trailed and brought to book.
