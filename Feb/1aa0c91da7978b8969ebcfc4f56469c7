Big Brother Titans housemate, Ipeleng, has emerged as the first female housemate to win Biggie’s Friday night Arena Game. The housemates were instructed to complete four tasks: ignite the light, put out the light, stack the lanterns, and copy the colours, which all the challenges were expected to be completed in four minutes. And any housemate, who completed the challenges in the shortest amount of time would be declared the prize winner. Ipeleng won this week’s game by completing the challenges in one minute and 50 seconds. Juicy Jay also finished the game in a record time, but Big Brother confirmed that the person behind the clock fumbled the controls. Reacting to the win on some social media, many viewers have called the game unfair after pictures showing Ipeleng stepping on the starting line surfaced on the internet. Recall that Big Brother had disqualified Yuvonne from one of the HoH games for the same reason.
