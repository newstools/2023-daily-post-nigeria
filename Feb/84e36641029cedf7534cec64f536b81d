Two hunters, whose names have not been ascertained, have discovered a bag full of Permanent Voter Cards, PVCs, in a forest in Nnewi, Anambra State. This is coming just four days to the all-important general election in Nigeria. The hunters saw the bag containing the PVCs in a bush in Akamili, a community in Nnewi, on Tuesday, and later took it to the premises of a popular radio station, Authority FM. Station manager of Authority FM, Mr Charles Ede, who spoke to DAILY POST said he was off duty when the cards were brought, but his staff members have reported to him about the incident. “I was off duty when the incident happened, but one of my staff members received the hunters when they came. I will send you his number,” he said. A video of the PVCs, which was made in the compound of the radio station in Nnewi, which has been trending online showed that most of the PVCs belonged to people of the area. The radio station’s staff, who ran a short commentary on the video, urged those who were yet to get their PVCs to come to the premises of the FM to check if they can find theirs.
