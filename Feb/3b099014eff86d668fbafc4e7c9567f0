A former National Assembly member, Senator Shehu Sani has lambasted the Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu over his position on the implementation of the new monetary policy by the Buhari administration. The Governor had challenged President Muhammadu Buhari, asking him to end the “endless drift into the abyss of chaos” created by the shortage of naira notes in the country. Akeredolu had also slammed the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Godwin Emefiele, for what he described as the “obviously mischievous implementation” of the naira redesign policy. He explained that the naira crisis affecting the generality of Nigerians has shown that the policy has woefully failed. Furthermore, the Ondo Governor called on the President Buhari-led government to allow the Supreme Court’s order on February 8 restraining the apex bank from carrying on with the February 10 deadline to stop the circulation of old naira notes. But Sani, who represented the Kaduna central district at the 8th Assembly, noted that the Governor has never been so concerned about the people before now, pointing out that the Ondo helmsman did not approach the security issues in his state the same way he has taken the issues of new monetary policy. “I read a long letter written to the President by my friend the Ondo Governor on the cashless policy. “I expected that long letter when terrorists massacred innocent lives in the state. I believe insecurity is the major problem in the state,” Sani tweeted.
