Former President Goodluck Jonathan and former Lagos Governor Bola Tinubu met on Tuesday amid smiles and banters. Jonathan and his delegation visited the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate at his Abuja residence. The former leader is the head of ECOWAS Election Monitoring Team for the general elections in Nigeria. The one-time Bayelsa State Governor and Vice President was accompanied by ex-President of Ghana, John Mahama. The meeting took place 72 hours after the conclusion of the presidential poll, amid complaints of over-voting, disenfranchisement and falsified results. Though Tinubu is leading, the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, is yet to declare the winner. Interestingly, the APC co-founder teamed up with President Muhammadu Buhari to defeat Jonathan at the 2015 presidential election. In July 2020, ECOWAS appointed him as the special envoy of its mediation mission to Mali after the military intervention.
