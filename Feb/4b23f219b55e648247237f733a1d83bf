Former Arsenal and Manchester City defender, Bacary Sagna, has backed the Gunners to win the Premier League title ahead of Pep Guardiola’s side this season. Sagna said that Arsenal could deal with pressure, adding that they have chemistry in their squad to win the Premier League title. Arsenal are currently on top of the Premier League table with three points ahead of second-placed Man City with a game in hand. But Sagna is backing Mikel Arteta’s side to go on and win their first Premier League title since 2004. “I want to believe there is enough experience and chemistry in the Arsenal squad to win the Premier League title,” Sagna told Premier League Odds. “It is the first time in a while that Arsenal have a good team bonding and connection with the coach. “The atmosphere at the stadium has been amazing from the start and I expect it to continue to the end. I don’t think Arsenal will crumble as Gary Neville said. “Arsenal can deal with the pressure, I remember when they played Manchester City last year and were the better team, but they lost. This time they’ll need to focus from the beginning to the end.”
