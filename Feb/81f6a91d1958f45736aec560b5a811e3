Arsenal legend, Paul Merson, has criticised Manchester United over their latest new signing, Marcel Sabitzer. Man United recently signed Sabitzer on loan from Bayern Munich. But Merson has now described Sabitzer as a ‘panic buy’. He stated this ahead of Man United’s Premier League tie with Crystal Palace on Saturday. “They [Manchester United] have brought Marcel Sabitzer in on loan from Bayern Munich, but is he what they really wanted? He was not on the radar in the first place, and it looks like a panic buy,” Merson told Sportskeeda. “I could not think of a better game to judge how much Eriksen could be missed. If you are bringing reinforcements in from Bayern, you are surely thinking of playing him.” Sabitzer will hope to feature for Erik ten Hag’s side against Crystal Palace this weekend.
