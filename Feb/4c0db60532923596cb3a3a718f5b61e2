Barely four days to the presidential election, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, has claimed that his party would win 25 states at a stretch. The Chief Whip of the Senate also claimed that all the people [presidential candidates] contesting for Saturday’s general election are helping the APC. Kalu spoke while fielding questions on Arise Television’s Morning Show programme on Tuesday. The likes of Bola Tinubu (APC), Atiku Abubakar (PDP), Peter Obi (LP) and Dr. Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso (NNPP), among others, will contest during Saturday’s presidential election to become Nigeria’s next president. “Peter Obi is a very close friend of my family and we go to the same Catholic church. I don’t want to get involved talking about Peter Obi, so I don’t want to discuss Atiku, I don’t want to discuss anything [about Obi too],” Kalu said. “Any question you want to ask me should be centred on my presidential candidate [Bola Tinubu], who is the incoming president and commander in chief. “This business is not done by tribe or region. It is about voting when all Nigerians agree that he will be president the way all Nigerians have agreed that Bola Tinubu will be president. “All the people contesting are helping our party. If you come here [Abia], the votes that will be shared are the votes of the PDP. If you go to the North, the vote that is supposed to be shared by Kwankwaso is a vote of the PDP. “Anywhere you go. Our main base is in the North, and our main base is in the Southwest. We are going to win about 20 states or 25 states at a stretch. I have no fear that February 25, and before midnight, President Bola Tinubu will be announced, President-elect.”
