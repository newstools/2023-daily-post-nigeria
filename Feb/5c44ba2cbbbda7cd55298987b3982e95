Arsenal legend Paul Merson has said that the club could lose out in the title chase this season. Merson said that the Gunners could even finish third if they suffer defeat to Aston Villa. The Gunners suffered a 3-1 defeat to title rivals Manchester City on Wednesday and were leveled on 2-2 down against Aston Villa as at the time of writing this report. A defeat to Aston Villa would open a three point lead between Mikel Arteta’s side and City. “I think if they win this game they’re in a title race, if they lose this game I would seriously be having a look at third,” Merson told Sky Sports. “They look nervous, there’s no change up.” Merson criticised Arsenal for playing just the same type of football that could see the likes of Bukayo Saka marked out of games. “This is the problem with Arsenal now they’re predictable,” he added.
