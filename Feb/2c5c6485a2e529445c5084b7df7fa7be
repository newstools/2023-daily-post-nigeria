Arsenal legend, Thierry Henry, has insisted that the financial allegations brought against Manchester City spurred them on in their Premier League 3-1 win over Arsenal on Wednesday night. According to Henry, Man City played as champions against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. Arsenal were defeated by Man City following goals from Kevin De Bruyne, Jack Grealish and Erling Haaland. Bukayo Saka did score a penalty for Mikel Arteta’s side during the encounter. Recall that Man City were last week charged with over 100 breaches of financial rules, with Pep Guardiola’s side potentially facing a raft of punishments. The Citizens will contend the charges, as they are insisting they are innocent of all the allegations. The saga has not affected their performances on the field as they defeated Arsenal to move top of the Premier League – ahead of the Gunners on goal difference. “I feel like teams that win titles cannot lose their control at any moment. Man City, you asked questions at the beginning. I wanted, I wished, I hoped that Arsenal would get the win – I said 2-1 for Arsenal,” Henry told CBS Sports during the Champions League coverage, noting that he felt the alleged breaches worked in Man City’s favour against Arsenal. “But City tonight showed you why they are champions, so far, because nobody has taken that title yet. “Since those financial fines, or not fine, or whatever is going to happen to Man City (allegations), I think that little thing did add something extra into City’s mind in that dressing room.” He added, “It changed it as Pep (Guardiola) can say to everybody they don’t want us to win, let’s show them we’re the champions. They played as champions.”
