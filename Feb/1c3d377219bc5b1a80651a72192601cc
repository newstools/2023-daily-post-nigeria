Liverpool legend, Jamie Carragher, has hit out at Tottenham Hotspur manager, Antonio Conte branding him as ‘impatient’. Carragher said Conte could not do what Mikel Arteta has done for Arsenal, adding that he lost his head at a press conferences. Conte, who has won one English Premier League title and four Serie A titles in his managerial career, is rated as one of the best managers in the game. Arteta, meanwhile, is yet to establish himself as a winner on the managerial circuit. Speaking on The Overlap, Carragher claimed that while Conte was a great manager, he didn’t possess the patience required to build a team like Arteta. “I don’t think Conte could do what Arteta has done, or Klopp, almost build it every year and getting better,” Carragher said. “Conte, he wants to win right now, he is impatient. That is why he loses his head in press conferences. I don’t think it is ever a project with Antonio Conte. And that is not a criticism. He wants to win today, he is not even thinking about tomorrow.”
