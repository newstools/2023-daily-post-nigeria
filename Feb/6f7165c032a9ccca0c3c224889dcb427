Some Nigerians on Friday protested the unavailability of the new naira notes in Mile 12 and Agege area of Lagos State. DAILY POST gathered that hoodlums took over major roads, attacking commuters, and the Bus Rapid Transport (BRT). Confirming the incident, the Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin said the commande is aware of the development and officers have been deployed to the area. “It is true. Our men are there. Reinforcement units have been deployed. Stay safe out there,” he tweeted. President Muhammdu Buhari had on Thursday ordered that the deadline on the use of the old N1000 and N500 notes remains. He said only the N200 Naira note would circulate alongside the new notes. Citizens have continued to experience hardship occasioned by the scarcity of the Naira notes. This is despite assurances by the Central Bank of Nigeria.
