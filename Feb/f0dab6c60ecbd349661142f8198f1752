Chelsea’s most expensive signing, Enzo Fernandez, has urged the club to sign 23-year-old forward, Joao Felix, on a permanent transfer at the end of the season. Fernandez described Felix, who is currently on loan at Chelsea from Atletico Madrid, as a great and fantastic player. “When you get on with someone off the field, it helps on the field to have that special connection,” the Argentina World Cup winner told The Times. “He’s a great player, isn’t he? A fantastic player. He’s got lots of ability and loads of qualities. “He is a key player for us, an important player, and he is on loan. “Let’s hope that Chelsea can do all they can to keep hold of him come June, that would be great.”
