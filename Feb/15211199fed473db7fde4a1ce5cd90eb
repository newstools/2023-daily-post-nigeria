The All Progressives Congress, APC, has described reports in some sections of the media about the postponement of the forthcoming elections as false and reckless. The party said the general election is a matter of extreme national importance bordering on national security and corporate integrity of the country, which should not become a matter for idle, rash or insensitive speculation by the media or any institution for that matter. APC National Publicity Secretary, Felix Morka in a statement issued on Wednesday said beyond its loud headline, the report offers no substantive justifying content aside from its intended purpose of misleading and causing needless anxiety and speculations regarding the upcoming elections. He noted that under President Muhammadu Buhari’s leadership, the ruling party continues to wage the most extensive and vibrant campaign in the history of the country’s democracy seeking to elect its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, his running mate, Kashim Shettima and governorship, national and state legislative flagbearers into office. Morka said: “Our attention has been drawn to a shadowy media report in some media outlets that the All Progressives Congress (APC) is pushing for a postponement of the 2023 general elections. The report is blatantly false and reckless, and bears no iota of credibility.” He maintained that the ruling party stood ready for the general election, and remained confident that Nigerians would overwhelmingly renew the party’s mandate in a peaceful, free and credible electoral contest.
