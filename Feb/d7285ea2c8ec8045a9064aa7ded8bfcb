Paris Saint-Germain head coach, Christophe Galtier has given a reason Marseille eliminated his team from the Coupe de France at the round of 16 stage on Wednesday. Galtier watched as Marseille defeated PSG following goals from Alexis Sanchez and Ruslan Malinovskyi. Sergio Ramos did score for PSG against Marseille at Stade Vélodrome. Speaking after the game, Galtier said PSG were unlucky and came up against a quality Marseille goalkeeper, adding that his players really struggled to put moves together during the encounter. “Even though we conceded a goal from a penalty and they had chances, we also had some in the first half but were occasionally unlucky or came up against a quality ‘keeper,” Galtier told PSG TV. He added, “One way or another, we managed to equalise. Then, in the second half, as soon as we conceded their second goal, Marseille switched to a low block and played on the transition, and at that point, given the number of bodies that Marseille had in defence, we really struggled to put moves together.”
