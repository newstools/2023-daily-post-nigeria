A Police patrolman has gunned down a woman in the Adamawa State capital, Yola, causing public fury. It was gathered Friday morning that the incident, which occurred at Doubeli culvert in Jimeta, Yola North LGA by 9:00pm on Thursday, also injured two children of the deceased and one other person. The offending policeman was said to be among policemen on routine patrol in the neighbourhood who held up a young man found sitting in front of his compound. Witnesses said the policemen wanted to whisk the man away but the neighbours resisted, demanding an explanation, a situation that annoyed the policemen who allegedly fired shots that hit and killed the woman, Maryam Abdullahi, a 70-year-old grandmother. The gunshots allegedly also hit three other people, two of them the womanâ€™s children, causing them injury. Angry youths reacted to the development by going violent and attacking the Doubeli police station. Responding to an enquiry, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, SP Suleiman Nguroje said the Police Seargent implicated in the gunshots has been arrested. He added that the command was carrying out further investigation for more facts on the case.
