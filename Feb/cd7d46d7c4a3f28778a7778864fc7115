The United Nations has advised Nigeria’s political parties and candidates to respect their commitments under the peace accord. All 18 political parties signed a peace pact on the 2023 general elections on Wednesday in Abuja. The agreement, coordinated by the National Peace Committee, NPC, entails that all parties accept the outcome of the elections. In the event of grievances, such are expected to be channelled through legitimate means for redress. UN Spokesperson, Stephanie Dujarric, told the News Agency of Nigeria in New York that the global body supports the accord. Dujarric confirmed there have been political engagements by the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel, UNOWAS. She said a top official is in contact with the NPC Chair and “ready to leverage good offices to support quiet diplomacy efforts to urge key actors to respect their commitments”. UNOWAS and the Office of the Resident Coordinator Office already engaged with the main candidates, opposition leadership and institutions.
