The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Kaduna State chapter, has advised all Christians to go out on election days to exercise their constitutional duties by casting their ballots to candidates of their choice. Kaduna CAN chairman, Rev. John Joseph Hayab, while speaking on Sunday during a program tagged: corporate prayers ahead of the 2023 general elections, said, “Christians from all walks of life in Kaduna State and the country as a whole should come out and perform their constitutional responsibilities by voting candidates of their choice. “In doing so, they should remain calm, peaceful and orderly in their conduct to vote credible candidates that will change the narratives of the country and give a new hope for the unity, peace and development of the country.” He explained, “Christians should stay away from any form of violence but ensure they are not intimidated by anybody by voting candidates of their choice.” The state CAN chairman warned Christians against selling their votes for peanuts, saying, “Selling of votes is an indication that one is inviting another four years of any kind of suffering. I think, we should think of the future of the country by electing credible leaders that will pilot its affairs in a manner that every Nigerian will be proud to belong.” He said that after praying for divine intervention for peaceful and credible elections in the country, “it is now time for Christians to exercise their faith by ensuring they elect God fearing leaders that would carefully manage the resources for the benefit of all without discrimination.”
