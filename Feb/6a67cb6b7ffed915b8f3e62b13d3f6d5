Two persons have been reportedly killed in Ward 12, Ubimini community, in Emohua Local Government Area of Rivers State. Trouble started when a member of Onelga Security Peace and Advisory Committee, a local security outfit, attempted to apprehend a young man for unknown reasons, but they were resisted by the people. It was gathered that the members of the local vigilante group started shooting sporadically, which led to the death of a woman. One of them was, however, apprehended when he attempted to flee, but he was mobbed by the people. The tension in the community led to the end of the election in unit 6 and 7 of Ward 12. Voters later re-converged in other polling units to continue with the process.
