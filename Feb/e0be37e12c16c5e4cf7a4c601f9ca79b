Manchester United legend, Gary Neville, has identified midfielder Casemiro as the club’s most important player under their manager Erik ten Hag, this season. Neville said this while giving his verdict on Casemiro’s three-match ban. Recall that Casemiro was given a red card during Man United’s Premier League 2-1 win against Crystal Palace over the weekend after placing both his hands around the neck of Will Hughes. The Brazilian international will now miss Man United’s next three Premier League games against Leeds United (home and away) and Leicester City. “It will be difficult for [Erik] Ten Hag because he’s been the most important player for Manchester United,” Neville said during his podcast with Sky Sports on Sunday. “He’s held the ball well in midfield, and Eriksen is obviously out as well.”
