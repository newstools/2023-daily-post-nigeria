Former Arsenal player, Kevin Campbell, has criticized the club’s midfielder Granit Xhaka. Campbell said Xhaka’s feet are not quick enough, adding that the Swiss is getting caught on the ball. Speaking on the Highbury Squad YouTube channel (via HITC), Campbell said: “We have seen Xhaka play better with [Thomas] Partey for a lot longer, we get that. At the end of the day, though, Xhaka, as an attacking force, has not been the same. “He is getting caught on the ball, and his feet are not quick enough most of the time.” He added, “Xhaka is more ponderous than [Patrick] Vieira. Over this period, it can happen and that is why you have Vieira there to make the difference.” Xhaka scored eight goals for Arsenal so far this season and has featured in 24 Premier League appearances for Mikel Arteta’s side.
