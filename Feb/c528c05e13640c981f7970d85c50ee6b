Mr Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, in the coming election, has promised to train youths with skills to address unemployment in Nigeria. Speaking on a courtesy visit to the Emir of Zazzau, Ahmed Nuhu Bamalli, at his palace in Zaria, the presidential candidate lamented that the north has not been adequately harnessed despite its vast fertile land. He assured, “I will priortise agriculture to address unemployment to give you ample opportunities to showcase their talents for their development and that of the country.” Obi also promised to revive industries that had been moribund in Kaduna and Kano states to give thousands of unemployed youths employment to contribute to the country’s development. He assured that if elected, Nigerians would no longer be deceived to vote along ethnic, sectional and religious lines, but steps would be taken to ensure divisive politics engaged by some politicians is completely ignored for politics of issues and credibility. LP’s vice-presidential candidate, Yusuf Datti Baba Ahmed, an indigene of Zaria, urged the electorate to vote massively for the party, assuring that they would work hard to justify the conference of Nigerians.
