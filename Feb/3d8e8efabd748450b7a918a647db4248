Former House of Representatives Speaker, Yakubu Dogara said Atiku Abubakar will be sworn in as Nigeria’s President by May. The legal practitioner and Bauchi native, made the prediction in a Twitter post on Sunday. “I still reaffirm in the words of Victor Hugo that, “All the forces in the world are not so powerful as an idea whose time has come.” “Atiku represents an idea whose time has come. By God’s grace, who alone gives power, Atiku will soon be president – elect and Mr president by May,” he tweeted Dogara advised Atiku’s supporters to discountenance “the propaganda on social media” as against what the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, would release. The former Speaker advised them to keep eyes on our goal “so that we don’t drop the ball”.
