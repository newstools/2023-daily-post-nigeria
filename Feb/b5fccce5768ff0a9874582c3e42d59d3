The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has arrested a 38-year-old man, identified as Salman Umar Hudu, in Abuja. Hudu was arrested in a hotel on Tuesday for impersonating the Chairman of EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa. In a statement by the commission, the 38-year-old got N100,000 from someone under the guise of being Bawa and handling any matter with the anti-graft agency. EFCC said the suspect would be charged to court after giving useful information. The statement reads partly: “The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Tuesday, February 14, 2023, arrested one Salman Umar Hudu, a 38-year-old indigene of Kano, at a hotel in Abuja, for falsely representing himself as the Executive Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa, and other officers of the Commission, and obtaining N100,000.00 from a person he convinced that he can ‘handle’ any matter with the EFCC.”
