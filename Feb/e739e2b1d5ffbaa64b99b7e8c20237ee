Former Nigerian lawmaker, Senator Shehu Sani, has reacted to the Supreme Court judgement on Monday, which restored the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan as the authentic Senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress APC, for Yobe North Senatorial District. Sani’s reaction was contained in a post via his verified Twitter handle. Recall that the Apex Court in its judgment voided and set aside the judgments of the Federal High Court and that of the Court of Appeal which had earlier confirmed Bashir Sheriff Machina as the APC Senatorial candidate. However, Sani said in his reaction noted that the forces against fair elections in the country are not giving up anytime soon. He also advised Nigerians to be watchful if the country must have a credible election. “It’s glaring that the forces against fair elections are unrelenting; We must all be vigilantes for democracy if we really want this election to be credible,” he tweeted.
