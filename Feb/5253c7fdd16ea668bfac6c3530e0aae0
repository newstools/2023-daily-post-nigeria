President Muhammadu Buhari has vowed to continue campaigning for the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. The president disclosed this while addressing Nigerians during APC presidential campaign rally in Nasarawa State. “I congratulate you and I can assure you we are going to win through and through; I’ll continue to campaign for Bola Ahmed Tinubu. He’s a committed Nigerian and I believe he’ll give all he has to this country and to you Nigerians. I thank you very much,” Buhari said. The president’s remark is coming amidst claims of a rift between Tinubu and certain elements within the presidency. Lately, Tinubu had said the current fuel scarcity and naira redesign policy by the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, was targeted at him. The APC flagbearer said Nigerians would vote for him despite the current situation in the country. Tinubu further claimed that some elements in the Presidential Villa were working against his presidential ambition. His claim was corroborated by Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State.
