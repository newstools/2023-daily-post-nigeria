Twitter owner Elon Musk has announced the Blue App will share revenues from advertisements that appear in reply threads between it and Twitter account holders. Musk disclosed this on Friday in a series of posts via his verified Twitter handle. He said only those who could benefit from the new policy are accounts that have subscribed to the Twitter Blue Verified icon. The Tesla boss further announced that Twitter’s legacy Blue Verified is tainted with corruption and so, would soon be phased out in a few months. He wrote, “Starting today, Twitter will share ad revenue with creators for ads that appear in their reply threads. To be eligible, the account must be a subscriber to Twitter Blue Verified. Twitter’s legacy Blue Verified is unfortunately deeply corrupted, so will sunset in a few months.”
