The Police in Ogun State has arrested two men who reportedly bought the stolen vehicle of the slain Fatinoyes. Mr Kehinde Fatinoye, his wife Bukola Fatinoye and their son, Oreoluwa, were all killed in an operation masterminded by their driver, Lekan Adekanbi and two others. After the assassination was carried out, the suspected killers also went away with a car belonging to the victims. In their determination to bring all those involved in the murder to justice, operatives of Ogun State Police Command on Monday, February 13, 2023, apprehended the two suspects, “who bought the stolen car of the deceased.” A statement by the police spokesman in Ogun, Abimbola Oyeyemi said the two suspects, Azeez Usman and Owolaja Aanuoluwapo were apprehended at different locations in Ogun State, following the confession of the suspected murderers that the Hyundai car was sold to Azeez Usman at N150,000. Oyeyemi explained that after killing the couple, the suspects got hold of their son and their adopted child, Felix Olorunyomi; they tied them with rope and drove them in the Hyundai car to the Ogun River bridge at Adigbe area, where they threw them into the river. The suspects were said to have parked the car somewhere in Oke Ata area of Abeokuta but they later contacted Owolaja, “who drove the vehicle to Azeez Usman’s workshop.” At the workshop, DAILY POST learnt that “the car was butchered into pieces and sold in parts.” According to a police investigation, the two suspects were duly informed that the said car was stolen but they went ahead and bought it at the rate of N150,000. He said the Commissioner of Police in Ogun, Frank Mba, has ordered that all the suspects be arraigned in court as soon as the investigation is concluded.
