The Murtala Muhammed Foundation, MMF, has stressed the need for decisive leadership as the country prepares for the 2023 general elections. The organisation noted that Nigeria needs a leader like the late Head of State who was committed to the wellbeing of all citizens. Muhammed was killed in Lagos, along with his aide-de-camp Lieutenant Akintunde Akinsehinwa on February 13, 1976, in an ambush on his way to office at Dodan Barracks. A statement on Monday, MMF Chief Executive Officer Aisha Muhammed-Oyebode said Muhammed’s regime birthed the transition to a democratic rule which was brought to fruition by his successor. “The greatest gift for late Head of State’s 47th memorial anniversary is to ensure a smooth transition through free and fair general elections on February 25, 2023,” it reads. Aisha emphasized that the nation is at “a fragile crossroads”, urging the people and the authorities to ensure elections that will usher good governance. She recalled her father’s administration prevailed in the battle against indiscipline, while creating the institutions that would engender nationalism, sustainable peace and security. The statement noted that Muhammed fought corruption to a standstill and began the process of moving the federal capital from Lagos to Abuja. “The administration addressed the issue of bureaucratic inefficiency, and, most importantly, initiated the process for a return to civilian rule.” Recalling Muhammed’s belief in the existence of a powerful and vibrant Nigeria within a united and affluent Africa, MMF said Nigerians can replicate that belief in their voting choices.
