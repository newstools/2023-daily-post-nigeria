Chelsea board will look to sell attacking midfielder Mason Mount this summer if he fails to agree to a new contract at the end of the season. Mount will enter the final year of his contract with Chelsea in the summer. The 24-year-old is yet to agree to fresh terms with the west London club. It’s understood that Mount is not willing to sign Chelsea’s current offer as the Blues want to tie him down to a seven-year deal. Chelsea currently risk losing the England international on a free transfer next year, but according to The Athletic, the club’s chiefs ‘will not countenance’ seeing the player leave the Premier League giants for nothing. Instead, Chelsea will be open to offers for Mount if his contract situation with the Stamford Bridge club is not resolved. The report added that the likes of Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United are all interested in a move for Mount.
