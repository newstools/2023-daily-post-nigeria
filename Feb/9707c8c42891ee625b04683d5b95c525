The Delta North senatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Ned Nwoko today said it’s not a do-or-die affair for him to be voted a senator. Nwoko made the assertion during an interactive session with journalists in Asaba. Nwoko who was a guest at “The Platform”, a programme organized by the Delta State Council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ also said he wouldn’t like to be in the opposition when he emerges as the next senator at the red chamber. He explained that he can’t function effectively well as an opposition in the house. According to Hon. Nwoko, it will be an uphill task for him to go and convince Peter Obi and Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to do what he wanted for him. He stressed: “It’s almost impossible. But if I have Okowa and Atiku, it’s easy. Please, make room for them. I believe they will make things happen. If I am in opposition, it becomes a problem.” Nwoko noted that the PDP agenda will be those things discussed and agreed upon with the people. While noting that the same goes for the governor, Nwoko told the people that they are shooting themselves in the leg if they support a candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC to be governor of Delta State. “I cannot work with an APC governor. I know him,” he said. He then solicited support for all PDP candidates in the forthcoming elections.
