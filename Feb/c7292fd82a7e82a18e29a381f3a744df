Famous Nigerian actor and comedian Ayodeji Richard Makun, also known by his stage name AY, has warned more Nigerians would flee the country if unresponsive leaders emerge winners in the forthcoming general elections. This statement was contained in a post via his verified Twitter handle on Monday. He wrote: “Nigeria Immigration Service issued a total of 1,899,683 passports in 2022, the highest in a single year. This JAPA mission will increase in 2023 if we vote in people who are not obedient and responsive to the needs of the people.”
