Malam Ibrahim, a bank customer in Dutse, alleged that the amount of the new naira notes in circulation is less than the amount released by the CBN to banks He alleged that the commercial banks were not giving out the money over the counter and all the ATMs are also not dispensing the new notes. According to him” No money in the banks, no money in the ATMs, where are the monies given to the commercial banks by the central banks of Nigeria, so these bank managers must explain where they are taking the money to.” Sadiya, another customer in Dutse, said for two days she has not been able to withdraw any money either in her bank or ATM because there was no money anywhere.
