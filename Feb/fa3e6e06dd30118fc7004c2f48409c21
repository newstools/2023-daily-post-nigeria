The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State has assured that its governorship candidate, Ladi Adebutu, would complete the agro-cargo airport in Iperu area of Ogun State. DAILY POST reports that the agro-cargo airport initiated by the Gbenga Daniel administration was revisited by the incumbent Governor, Dapo Abiodun. On Thursday, the airport witnessed its maiden test flight at an occasion graced by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and other dignitaries. But, the PDP in a statement by its spokesman in Ogun, Akinloye Bankole, reminded Ogun people that the cargo airport project was actually a brainchild of the PDP administration in Ogun State between 2003 and 2011. Bankole said, “the project was licensed for Cargo/Commercial/Training Airport as obtained by the Otunba Gbenga Daniel, OGD’s administration.” While acknowledging the good in the fact that Gov Abiodun chose to continue with the project, the PDP wondered why the experiment on maiden flight testing “when there is no observation tower that would monitor and coordinate landing signal equipment, terminal building and other technical requirements at the airport.” The opposition party described the flight test as a ‘fly and land blind’; an extremely deadly sign-posted political ziggy.” “As of today, 24th Feb, 2023, we have it on good authority that the only physical structure at the airport that is close to completion is the runway which has not been fully certified by the Nigeria Cargo Airport Authority (NCAA). Therefore, the macabre dance at the airport construction site yesterday was one of his orchestrated antics to bamboozle unsuspecting members of the public. “By the special grace of Almighty God and through the anticipated mandate of the people come March 11, 2023, Hon. Oladipupo Adebutu will give the cargo airport project the deserved attention and speedy completion of all facilities that an International airport deserves,” the PDP assured.
