Former Chelsea striker, Tony Cascarino, has urged his former club, under the leadership of Todd Boehly, to sign Brentford’s Ivan Toney. Cascarino said Toney, who is rated £100m, is so strong, adding that the England international will thrive well at Chelsea. The number 9 position has proved problematic for the Premier League giants in recent seasons, with Romelu Lukaku failing to justify a stunning £100 million move to the Blues and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang flopping this season. While Chelsea are struggling under manager Graham Potter, Cascarino believes the Stamford Bridge club are ‘so close’ to clicking and says Toney could be the ‘missing piece of the jigsaw’ for the west London club. “Chelsea are so close to getting it right under Graham Potter,” Cascarino told The Times. “Their performance away to West Ham – particularly in the first 20 minutes – was much improved, but they’re still crying out for a striker. Ivan Toney could be the missing piece of the jigsaw. “With runners off him such as Mykhailo Mudryk and Joao Felix and quality deliveries into the box, the Brentford forward would thrive at Chelsea. “He’s so strong in the air, loves to get in behind and has the confidence and swagger to succeed at a top club.”
