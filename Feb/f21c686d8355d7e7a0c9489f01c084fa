The All Progressives Congress, APC, has denied reports that its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu asked Nigerians to disregard President Buhari’s order on naira notes. Director, Media and Publicity, APC Presidential Campaign Council, Mr Bayo Onanuga, in a statement on Friday, said that the report was an attempt by opposition elements to put a wedge between Buhari and Tinubu. Onanuga described the report as fake news, stressing that Tinubu never issued an advisory on behalf of Asiwaju Tinubu. He stated: “Our attention has been drawn to fake viral news published by the Peoples Gazette, claiming Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the APC presidential candidate has asked APC governors to ignore President Muhammadu Buhari’s broadcast and enforce the Supreme Court ruling on the recirculation of old naira notes. The message quoted by Peoples Gazette was being randomly shared on WhatsApp. Mr Alake was not the author.” Onanuga maintained that Tinubu has called for calm as the authorities try to find a solution to the currency crisis and also offered a six-point suggestion to lessen the anguish Nigerians are facing trying to get money from commercial banks. According to him, it was inconceivable and unthinkable that Tinubu would instruct APC governors to disregard President Muhammadu Buhari’s order on the currency matter. Onanuga, therefore, urged journalists to always confirm the authorship of their materials from the Media & Publicity Directorate of the campaign.
