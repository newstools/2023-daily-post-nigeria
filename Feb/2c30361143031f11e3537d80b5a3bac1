The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has explained why there were collation glitches during the Presidential and National Assembly elections on February 25 across the country. According to the electoral body, the delay experienced in the collation of results was due to the inability of some ad-hoc staff to work up to speed in transmitting the collated results to the INEC viewing centre. INEC’s National Commissioner, Festus Okoye, disclosed this on Sunday. Speaking on Channels Television’s The 2023 Verdict, he said: “We conducted this election in 176,848 units across all the states of the federation. It’s the responsibility of the Presiding Officers (POs) and the Registration Area (RA) technical support staff to assist and make sure these results are uploaded into our INEC result viewing centres. “Some of them (ad-hoc staff) are not uploading the results with the speed we expected them to upload the results. So, our IT support staff have been contacting most of them to make sure they do the right thing and upload these results in real-time for Nigerians to have confidence and see these results as they are coming in.”
