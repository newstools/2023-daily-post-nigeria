The presidential campaign council of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has canceled the planned rally in Kano State. The Secretary of the campaign council, James Faleke in a tweet on Thursday, said the rally that was scheduled for February 16 has been cancelled. Mr Faleke did not provide any reason for the cancellation of the rally. The campaign held a rally on 4 January in Kano at the Sani Abacha Stadium but according to the timetable of the party, Kano is supposed to host the party twice. It is unclear if the cancellation of the rally is unconnected to the outcry over the scarcity of Naira.
