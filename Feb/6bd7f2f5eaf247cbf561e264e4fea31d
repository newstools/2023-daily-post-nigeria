Kelechi Iheanacho has been named in the Premier League Team of the week for the second consecutive week. Iheanacho was on target and provided an assist in Leicester City’s 4-1 win against Tottenham Hotspur last weekend. The 26-year-old was also named Man of the Match after the game. The Nigeria international was also included in the Team of the Week in the previous matchday after scoring once and recording two assists in the 4-1 win against Aston Villa. Iheanacho has netted three times and provided five assists in 16 league appearances for the Foxes this season. The forward has regained his position in Leicester City’s starting line-up after he previously lost his place in the side.
