Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, his three predecessors, Ibikunle Amosun, Gbenga Daniel and Segun Osoba on Friday met with the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Ladi Adebutu and his running mate, Adekunle Akinlade. The Ogun political heavyweights met one another at the funeral church service of late Dame Caroline Adebutu, mother of the PDP gubernatorial candidate. At the event held at the Wesley Methodist Cathedral, Iperu, Ikenne Local Government Area of Ogun State, the politicians sympathised with Ladi and his father, Sir Kessington Adebutu.  The funeral service presented an uncommon opportunity for the politicians to meet one another and exchange pleasantries a few weeks to the 2023 general elections. DAILY POST reports that Abiodun is contesting against Ladi under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), while Amosun is behind the candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), despite being a member of the APC. At the event, Abiodun and his closest rival in the 2019 election, Akinlade, had a handshake; the first since four years ago.  Speaking about the event, Abiodun said: “We were at the funeral church service of late Dame Caroline Oladunni Adebutu, JP, wife of Sir Kessington Adebutu, at the Wesley Methodist Cathedral, Iperu this morning. “Until her passage to eternal glory, she was a woman of virtue who lived a very good and fulfilling life. “We pray God grant her eternal rest.”
