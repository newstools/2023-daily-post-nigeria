One person was reportedly killed in the Apata area of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, on Saturday when protesters clashed with security agents. DAILY POST was told that two persons were also injured in the incident at the Dogo area of Apata and have been hospitalised. The clash is barely 24 hours after protests rocked some parts of Ibadan. Some protesters had on Friday staged protests over the scarcity of new naira notes and petrol in Ibadan. Some affected areas include Agodi Gate, Iwo Road, Monatan, Olodo and Iyana Church. It was, however, learnt that some people in the early hours of Saturday staged a protest in the Apata area. The clash, it was learnt, led to the death of one person who is a commercial motorcyclist. “I have told you the cause, the Apata people did their own today. You know that there were protests in Iwo Road and Gate yesterday. It is because of the scarcity of new naira notes and petroleum. It happened at Dogo, just immediately after government college,” a source told DAILY POST. Our correspondent learnt that normalcy has returned to the area. Efforts made to get a reaction from the Public Relations Officer of the state police command, Adewale Osifeso, proved to be abortive.
