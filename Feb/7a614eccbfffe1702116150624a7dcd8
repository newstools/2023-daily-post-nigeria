Paris Saint-Germain forward, Lionel Messi, has broken his eternal rival Cristiano Ronaldo’s record of scoring the most goals in Europe’s top-five leagues (EPL, La Liga, Ligue 1, Bundesliga and Serie A). Messi surpassed Ronaldo when he netted PSG’s second goal in their 3-1 Ligue 1 victory over Montpellier on Wednesday. The Argentina captain scored his 697th club goal, having played his entire senior professional career in Europe’s top-five leagues. The former Barcelona captain overtook Ronaldo’s tally of 696 goals while taking 84 fewer games than the Portugal captain. Messi is now just four short of Ronaldo’s tally of 701 all-time club goals. Ronaldo is yet to score for his new club Al-Nassr in a competitive encounter, so it might not take long for Messi to overtake him. Messi’s goal against Montpellier was his 14th goal of the season for PSG in all competitions so far this term.
