On-loan Manchester United midfielder, Marcel Sabitzer avoided a red card against Leicester City, because VAR officials didn’t feel his tackle was made with sufficient force or momentum, the UK Mirror reports. Sabitzer only arrived at Old Trafford in January from Bayern Munich. The midfielder’s arrival was timely after Casemiro was handed a three-match ban after picking up a red card against Crystal Palace. But Sabitzer was lucky to escape a suspension after a nasty-looking tackle on Foxes defender, Wout Faes. The incident occurred in the final moments of the first half where Marcus Rashford had given the hosts the lead. A positive 45 minutes would have been undermined had referee Stuart Attwell reached for his red card.
