A crowd of voters across council wards in Ohaji/Egbema local government area of Imo State are stranded following the non-availability of election materials. Recall that the electoral umpire had stated that voting would commence throughout the federation today by 8:30am. When our correspondent visited booths 003 and 004 in Assa/Obile ward of the LGA, there was no election actually. At the time of filing this report, neither officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) detailed to administer the elections nor agents of the various contesting political parties were seen. However, the worried voters are now wondering whether voting would still take place in the council area or not. Meanwhile, some voters are still milling around the venues designated for their polling booths in anticipation of the arrival of election materials, officials and party agents.
