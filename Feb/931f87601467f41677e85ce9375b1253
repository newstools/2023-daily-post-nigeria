Nollywood actress, Kate Henshaw has called out the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, for disenfranchising her and twenty others in her polling unit. In a video shared on her Twitter handle, the actress lamented that she could not cast her vote because the BVAS says she is not registered. Henshaw explained further that she found her name on the register on the wall and the INEC register. However, she can’t vote. She called on the person in charge of INEC in Lagos to find a quick solution to the problem. While stating that she won’t take things easy with INEC for playing with her destiny, the actress also called on international media organisations like BBC and CNN to note what is happening in Nigeria.
