Premier League star, James Ward-Prowse, has become the latest footballing personality to pick who is the greatest player of all time (GOAT) between Paris Saint-Germain’s Lionel Messi and Al-Nassr’s Cristiano Ronaldo. Both Messi and Ronaldo are arguably the two best players of their time. With 12 Ballon d’Or awards, 1,400 club goals and nine Champions League trophies between them, Messi and Ronaldo have dominated the sport like no other footballer. Messi even added the FIFA World Cup trophy to his collection last December, which Ronaldo does not have in his corner. The Messi-Ronaldo debate has been raging on for over ten years, with no definitive answer still in sight. Some of the most decorated footballing personalities have had their say over the years, with Ward-Prowse, who is the current captain of Premier League side Southampton, being the latest to file his answer. Ward-Prowse picked Ronaldo over Messi in the GOAT debate. The 28-year-old revealed his pick in the #ThisOrThat challenge on JD Football’s Tik Tok account. Choosing between Ronaldo and Messi was not the only task that Ward-Prowse was handed. The midfielder was also asked to pick between Zinedine Zidane and Andres Iniesta, with Ward-Prowse picking the Spaniard. He also chose Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk over Manchester City legend Vincent Kompany and Thierry Henry over Ronaldo Nazario as well.
