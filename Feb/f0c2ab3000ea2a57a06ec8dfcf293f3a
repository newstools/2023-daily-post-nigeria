Ahead of the 2023 presidential election, the General Overseer of Christ Embassy Church, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome has revealed what an angel told him about the leading candidates. Oyakhilome who spoke at the Loveworld praise-athon on Friday said the name of Nigeria’s next president is in the Bible. The cleric said the first candidate is under the influence of a devil. ”The Lord gave him a name. The name is Jackal. He is influenced by a demon. This demon is mocking Nigeria. But he’s been cut off. He further stated that if the second candidate wins, he will sell the country, ” In the spirit, the second candidate, if you let him get into office, you will have no country. You would have sold your country.” He, however, added that the third candidate is scared of winning. ”The third candidate, there’s fear of winning. He is afraid to win. But the lord will give him wings to fly! HIS NAME IS IN THE BIBLE. Hope you’ve gotten your PVC?” he asked. The leading candidates for Saturday’s general election are Asiwaju Bola Tinubu of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party and Peter Obi of the Labour Party.
