Arsenal captain, Martin Odegaard has revealed that manager Mikel Arteta convinced him to join the Emirates club when they were in 15th position in the Premier League table. Odegaard initially joined Arsenal on a loan deal from Real Madrid in January 2021 before the Gunners made the move permanent for £30m plus bonuses the following summer. The Norway international, who was made Arsenal’s permanent skipper last summer has played a key role in their success since his arrival from Los Blancos. “I spoke to Mikel Arteta on a Zoom call and he told me all about the project,” Odegaard wrote in The Players’ Tribune. “At the time, Arsenal weren’t doing well. They were way down like 15th in the [Premier League] table, but that meeting… Honestly, I challenge anyone to come away from a meeting with Arteta and not believe everything he tells you. “He’s next level. It is hard to explain. He is passionate, he is intense and sometimes, yeah, he is a bit crazy… but when he speaks, you understand that whatever he says will happen, will happen.”
