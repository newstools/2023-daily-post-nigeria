The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Friday appointed Isa Abdulmumin as the Acting Director of the Corporate Communications Department at the apex bank. Abdulmumin’s appointment followed the retirement of Osita Nwanisobi, the immediate past Director of the department. The Deputy Director, reputed to be a hard-working and efficient professional has been in the service of the bank for many years. Before Abdulmumin joined the Apex bank, he had worked as a Senior editorial staff and manager in the Trust group of newspapers: Daily Trust, Weekly Trust and Aminiya (the Hausa version). Recall that Nwanisobi had taken over as the boss of the apex bank’s communication section in October 2020, when his predecessor, Isaac Okorafor, retired from service. He served as a special assistant to the Financial System Stability (FSS) Deputy Governor between 2009 and 2011 and also as a Special Assistant to the Corporate Services Deputy Governor from 2001 to 2009.
