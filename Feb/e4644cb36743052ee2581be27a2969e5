The Brazilian Football Federation have denied reports that Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has agreed on a new deal to take over as the head coach of the national team. Brazil have been actively seeking a new manager since Tite stepped down after their exit from the quarter-finals of the 2022 FIFA World Cup last year. Reports had earlier emerged that Ancelotti had agreed to join Le Selecao as their head coach. The former Chelsea and Everton manager was among the high-profile names to take over as Brazil’s national coach. However, the Brazil football federation has now denied those rumors in a statement on Friday. The statement read in part, “The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) informs that the news released this Friday (10/02) that the coach of Real Madrid, Italian Carlo Ancelotti, is the new coach of the Brazilian national team is unfounded.”
