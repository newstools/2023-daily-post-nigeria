Former France left-back Bixente Lizarazu has told PSG boss Christophe Galtier he is too dependent on Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe and Neymar. The French top-flight champions managed to secure a 2-1 win against Toulouse at the weekend. Superstars Mbappe and Neymar were not available for the game over injury problems. Galtier drafted in Achraf Hakimi, who scored the equalizer after Branco van den Boomen had put the visitor ahead before Messi won the match for the Ligue1 giants. Lizarazu, who played for Bayern Munich, noted that Galtier is relying too much on Messi, Mbappe and Neymar. He said the manager is still looking for the best lineup that suits the squad, adding, “And so far he can’t find it. This team is always dependent on its stars,” he told Canal Supporters: “Obviously, the absence of Kylian Mbappé in the first game is a big problem because he scares all defenses with his quality of speed, his depth. “Paris Saint-Germain is obviously less dangerous without Kylian Mbappé.”
