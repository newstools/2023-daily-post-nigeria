The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Enugu State, Barr. Peter Mbah has instituted a libel suit against the Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the State, Barr. Ugochukwu Agballah. Mbah is claiming that a certain statement and a publication by the defendant were “calculated to lower him in the estimation of right thinking members of the society.” The lawsuit marked E/25/2023, filed before the Enugu State High Court said the action of the defendant was meant to “isolate the claimant (Mbah) from the society; expose the Claimant to hatred, odium, contempt, and ridicule, cause other persons to shun or avoid the Claimant and discredit the Claimant in the matter of his business and political engagements. Mbah is therefore demanding the sum of N1 billion as general damages for the said libelous publication. He accused Chief Agballah of false and malicious publication about his person. In a Statement of Claim filed by his lawyers, Dr. Onyechi Ikpeazu, SAN & Co, Mbah said Agballah accused him of joining the governorship race in order to use Enugu’s funds to pay up an alleged N40 billion business debt. He equally accused Agballah of labelling him a member of a criminal gang, which allegedly engaged in malicious damage to property, assault, and other criminal activities against the people of Enugu State. Mbah said he was severally embarrassed by countless calls and messages from concerned family members, business and political associates, loved ones, friends and in-laws, while several Nigerians, who thought the claims to be true, condemned him in the media and social media platforms. Mbah added that although he had caused his solicitors to write the defendants vide a correspondence dated 22nd July, 2022, in which he demanded a retraction of the publication and an apology as well as compensation for damaging his reputation, they chose to ignore it. Mbah is equally demanding N10 million as cost of the suit.
