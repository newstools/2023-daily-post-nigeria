The Muslim Right Concern, MURIC, on Wednesday called for justice for a woman purportedly raped inside a worship centre in Oyo State. This was disclosed in a statement issued by its Oyo State Ambassador, Ibrahim Agunbiade. MURIC, an Islamic group, said it would do everything possible to make sure the incident was not swept under the carpet. The statement disclosed that the group had confirmed the suspect is one Idris, also referred to as Kesari Rekereke. MURIC alleged that Idris was the son of an influential transport union leader known in the Oyo State National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW). The statement read in part: “We call for the prosecution of Idris and warn that the case must not be swept under the carpet. “We commend the police for arresting the culprit. Justice must not only be done in this case but it must also be seen to have been done.” MURIC also implored the Muslim faithful in Oyo to stay calm and law-abiding and not take the law into their own hands.
