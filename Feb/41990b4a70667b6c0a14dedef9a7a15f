Chelsea manager, Graham Potter, has insisted that a recent tweet ‘liked’ by the club’s co-owner Todd Boehly’s Twitter account criticising defender Marc Cucurella is ‘not a reflection’ of the American billionaire. On Thursday, Boehly’s Twitter account liked a tweet from football.london with an article carrying quotes from Chelsea legend Frank Leboeuf. “We don’t want to see Cucurella anymore,” Leboeuf said. “With all due respect to a man that I don’t know, the player is not good enough for Chelsea. It is as simple as that.” When asked about the development, Potter told a press conference on Friday ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League tie with West Ham United on Saturday: “I don’t know, I can’t comment. It’s nothing I would say is a reflection of Todd in any way. “But I don’t know how social media works. But like I have said, everyone here is really supportive of Marc and we are trying to help him get back to the level he can get to and enjoy his football because if a player is enjoying their football, they are playing well.” Cucurella, 24, was named Brighton’s Player of the Season under Potter last season. He joined Chelsea from Brighton in a £57million deal last summer but has struggled to replicate last season’s superb form in the west London club.
