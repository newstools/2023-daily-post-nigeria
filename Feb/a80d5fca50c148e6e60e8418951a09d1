Former Nigeria’s minister of finance Dr. Ngonzi Okonjo Iweala has revealed what she noticed in her polling unit as she cast her vote on February 25, 2023. Nigeria held its successive 7th election in the democratic dispensation on Saturday and Okonjo Iweala returned home to perform her civic duties. The Director-General of the World Trade Organization, WTO, has since returned to Geneva, Switzerland after the exercise but did not leave without revealing what appeared strange to her. It is on record that Nigerian youths turned out en masse to cast votes for their choice of presidential and National Assembly candidates on Saturday. It was the first time an election in the country would receive such a massive attention from the young people. Okonjo Iweala said that ‘all’ the young people in her village in Umuda Isingwu village, Umuahia, Abia state, cast their votes, adding that the election was largely peaceful. “Back in Geneva, happy to have voted & to see Nigeria’s youth in action! All the young people in my village had PVCs & voted. “Despite some challenges, thank God for a largely peaceful election. We pray for peace to prevail. Wishing all of us & Nigeria well at this important time,” she wrote.
