Ahead of the presidential election on Saturday, the candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has reflected on the deaths of some party leaders and members in the course of the campaigns. The Labour Party had lost some of its members and notable among them are Mallam Lawal Garba, who was the Zonal Party Chairman in Kaduna. He died in a ghastly motor accident late last year. The Labour Party Women Leader in Kaduna State, Mrs Victoria Chimtex, was murdered in Kaura late last year, while the party’s candidate for Onuimo LGA Constituency of Imo State Christopher Elehu, was killed in December 2022. Others are Isaac Dauda the party’s leader in Mangu Local Government Area, Plateau State, who died in January 2023 and a supporter in Lagos State who was amputated. “We console and pray for the repose of the souls of Nigerians, particularly our supporters that died or were killed in our struggle for a New Nigeria,” he tweeted on Thursday evening while mentioning the above names and how they died. Obi further lamented the attacks on members of his political party and supporters, especially the recent one in Lagos State where some of them were attacked and badly injured during a rally in the state. He sympathized with them and also reminded the security agencies that the attackers should be brought to book.
