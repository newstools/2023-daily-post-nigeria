The All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu has cautioned the people of Anambra State against voting for his counterpart from the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi. Tinubu said Obi would deny his promises like the Biblical Peter denied Jesus Christ three times before the cock crowed. He spoke at his presidential campaign rally at Ekwueme Square in Awka, the Anambra State capital on Tuesday. Tinubu said a man who kept people at home to suffer could turn around and ask to be voted for. According to Tinubu: “I’m not afraid of anybody, and I don’t worry. The man who left here, he calls himself Peter Obi. We read in the Bible that before the cock crows three times, he will deny Jesus Christ. “Before cock crows, he denied. So how can he keep a promise to you? He who cannot keep a promise to God.” Describing himself as smart, Tinubu said he never closed down any market or killed anybody.
