A former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, on Friday described the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Godwin Emefiele as a satan sent to torment Nigerians. Fani-Kayode said Emefiele would soon be abandoned by the satan using him. In a tweet, the All Progressives Congress, APC, chieftain wrote: “Godwin, you were sent by Satan to torment Nigeria. You are an inglorious bastard & a beast. “The satan that is using you will soon abandon you & drop you like used toilet paper. After that the Nigerian people will skin you alive and make you pay for your crimes against humanity.” The APC chieftain also disclosed that the Federal Government has bowed to the will of the Supreme Court. “The FG has bowed to the will of the Supreme Court and declared that the old naira notes remain legal tender unless and until the court says otherwise. We WIN,” he wrote. Emefiele has been criticized by Nigerians over the scarcity of the Naira following the redesign of N200, N500, N1000 notes. Despite efforts by the CBN to stop the circulation of the old denominations, the Supreme Court had halted the Federal Government from stopping the use of the old notes from February 10.
