The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, IPMAN, has denied planning to cease operations once the government enforces N195 per litre pump price. A statement on Monday by National Operations Controller Mike Osatuyi advised the public to ignore the information. Mojeed Adesope, Publicity Officer of Ibadan Depot, on February 3, called for the shutdown of IPMAN filling stations over the fuel price limit. Adesope said dealers, particularly independent marketers, were not comfortable with the government’s directive due to the high ex-depot price. But Osatuyi hinted the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd., NNPCL, was preparing the logistics to start supplying petrol to IPMAN members directly. He urged members to sell petrol to Nigerians, assuring the association would not undermine national security by hoarding the product. “Apart from IPMAN members loading at DAPPMAN depots in Abule-Ado, Ijegun, Lagos, DAPPMAN has also agreed to sell petrol at N172 per litre to IPMAN members.” The official also disclosed lPMAN would soon load at NIPCO and MRS depots massively for South West and North West. He however appealed to the Petroleum Tanker Drivers, PTD, under the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Worker, NUPENG, to reduce transportation costs.
