Hours after the Supreme Court stopped the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN from executing the February 10 deadline for the validity of old naira notes, the governor of the apex bank, Godwin Emefiele met with President Muhammadu Buhari. DAILY POST recalls that a seven-man panel of the Supreme Court led by Justice John Okoro, in a unanimous ruling had on Wednesday ordered that the old naira notes remain in circulation even after the new deadline. The development followed an ex parte filed on Tuesday by the Kogi, Kaduna and Zamfara state governments. The Supreme Court also held that the Federal Government and the CBN must not continue with the deadline pending the determination of the hearing on February 15. The outcome of the meeting is yet to be known but according to Channels TV, the visit by the apex bank chief is in connection to the ruling of the Supreme Court.
