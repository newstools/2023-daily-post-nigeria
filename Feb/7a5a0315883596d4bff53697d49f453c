Abel Ogwuche will take the place of captain Daniel Bamaiyi in the Flying Eagles’ line-up for the quarter-final clash against the Hippos of Uganda. Bamaiyi is suspended for the encounter after picking up his second yellow card of the competition in Flying Eagles’ 2-0 win against Mozambique last Saturday. Ogwuche, who plays for Swedish club, Trelleborgs FF, has been picked as the man to take his place, according to a report in SCORENigeria. He got the god because of his physical presence and aerial ability. The Flying Eagles will take on the Ugandans at the Suez Canal Stadium, Ismailia on Thursday. A win in the game will see them book a spot at the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup to be hosted by Indonesia.
