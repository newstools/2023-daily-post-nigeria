The Ondo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, APC on Wednesday, ordered the immediate suspension of its campaign activities in the state over the current scarcity of fuel and the newly redesigned naira notes. Mr Ade Adetimehin, the state chairman of the party in a statement explained that the decision was in solidarity with residents of the state. “The party has, therefore, directed Chairmen, and Director-Generals at all levels, within the chapter, to suspend rallies, in sympathy with our people,” Adetimehin said. The chairman expressed regrets that the country was experiencing an unusual shortage of petrol and scarcity of the new naira notes, a few weeks to “an all-important general election.” He argued that the people of the state had the right to be angry, and express the same over the unfortunate development but urged them to do so as “patriots that believed in a better tomorrow.” “As a party, we identify with our people at this unpleasant period. We agree they are exercising their rights but we urge them to do so with measures of restraints. “Our belief is that this time shall fade soon,” he added He commended the efforts of the Gov. Rotimi Akeredolu-led administration to ameliorate the harsh situation and ensure the security of residents of the state.
