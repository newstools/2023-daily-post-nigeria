The Taraba State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, APC, caucus in the National Assembly has rejected the removal of Ibrahim El-Sudi as its chairman. The caucus, led by Danjuma Shidi, a member of the House of Representatives, briefed journalists on Monday at the National Assembly on the current crisis rocking the party. Shidi, who is APC senatorial candidate for Taraba South, said the removal of the embattled chairman was done by a skewed and self-serving section of the State Executive Committee. It would be recalled that El-Sudi was removed on Sunday by the SEC of the state for “negligence”. Also, the party is scheduled to conduct a fresh governorship primary after the court sacked Emmanuel Bwacha, its governorship candidate. Shidi said the perpetrators of the impeachment were working in connivance with the Peoples Democratic Party. “The perpetrators of this unholy idea are in deep romance and in fact sponsored by the Peoples Democratic Party state government in Taraba to destabilize the APC.”
