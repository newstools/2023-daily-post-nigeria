The national leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, has reacted to a letter currently in circulation on social media, alleging that the sum of N2 billion was given by the presidential candidate of the Labour party, Mr Peter Obi to Churches under the umbrella of CAN. CAN’s reaction is contained in a statement signed by Archbishop Daniel C. Okoh, its President, and made available to reporters on Sunday. The CAN president stated categorically that the so-called letter of petition reportedly signed by one Pastor Frank Onwumere and addressed to the office of CAN President is illogical and can best be described as a failed attempt to drag the apex Christian body into the politics of 2023. The statement said that CAN will investigate the source of the letter in the interest of the public. To set the records straight, CAN said it was not aware of any N2 billion given to churches in Nigeria to mobilise votes for any 2023 presidential candidate and never received the said petition dated December 22, 2022. “Nigerians should note that CAN, as a faith-based entity, maintains its non-partisan stance and will not endorse or mobilise support for any candidate in the upcoming elections as against the social media post being circulated by some elements bent on soiling its name and image,” the statement spelt out. The apex Christian body, therefore, called on Nigerians to disregard the purported letter of petition as its contents are not only untrue but malicious. “We warn those peddling the falsehood to desist from such acts because they are capable of defaming innocent people and revered religious institutions as well as breaching public peace,” it said.
