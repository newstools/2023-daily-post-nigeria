Chelsea boss, Graham Potter, has explained why Southampton defeated his team 1-0 in Saturday’s Premier League tie. Potter watched as James Ward-Prowse’s only goal of the match ensured Southampton defeated Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. The Englishman said that Chelsea lost a bit of fluidity and cohesion against Southampton, adding that even their second-half display was not good enough. “It was, certainly, in the first half. Returning from the Champions League and we had to make some changes, we lost a bit of fluidity and cohesion,” Potter said at his post-match press conference. “Southampton mixed the game well, but our performance wasn’t what we wanted in the first half and I take as much responsibility in that. The second half was good and we deserved a goal. But when you don’t, it’s obviously difficult.” He added, “My job is to help the team and work through a team period. The truth is we took a step back with our performance in the first half. Our response in the second half was good, but it wasn’t enough.”
