Nollywood actress Sarah Martins has reacted to May Edochie, the first wife of actor Yul Edochie’s N500 million lawsuit against her following her photoshopped image. May Edochie had earlier taken legal action against the actress for sharing a photoshopped version of her family picture which had Yul’s second wife, actress Judy Austin, in the frame. Sharing the suit file on her Instagram page on Saturday, May noted that she had directed her lawyers to file a charge against Sarah Chukwukere, with the username @officialsarahmartins, for sharing an edited image of her and her children. The lawsuit demanded a public apology and a retraction of a defamatory publication as she threatened to sue for N500 million in damages if Sarah failed to meet the demands stated. Reacting to this on her Instagram page, Sarah stated: “I wasn’t the one that made the utterances she claimed I made. one Sandra James was the one that said all she claimed. ”No, I won’t keep quiet, especially when I’m being insulted, harassed and bullied by her so-called fans over what I did not do. Today, I was physically harassed by her uncultured and aggressive followers, and I won’t tolerate such behaviour against me again. You will hear from my legal team.” Recall that during the 2022 Christmas celebration, May shared photos of her and four children while wishing her fans a merry Christmas on her Instagram page. Hours later, Sarah Chukwukere photoshopped Yul, his second wife Judy Austin and their baby boy into the picture posted by May. Reacting to this, Yul wrote: “Yes, oo Sarah. Beautiful family. As it should be. Blessed man with blessed family. Everybody will be living in peace, love and jolly. May Zukwanuike.”
