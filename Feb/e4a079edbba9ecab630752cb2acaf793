It seems the scarcity of Premium Motor Spirit, PMS, otherwise known as petrol that hit Osun State will not abate in the coming days. DAILY POST had reported that the Osun State Governor, Ademola Adeleke on Friday, set up a special monitoring committee which was tasked with making PMS available. The team, which is headed by his Chief of Staff, Kazeem Akinleye is to look into the deepening distribution and pricing challenges.  The monitoring team, which comprises the Nigeria Police, DSS, Army, IPMAN, NLC, TDU is to monitor the distribution of PMS from point of delivery by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to various discharge outlets in Osun State. Governor Adeleke had urged the monitoring team to liaise with the major marketers for collaboration with the independent marketers to ensure that the products are circulated across the State. While promising to look into the development, he reiterated the commitment of his administration not to fold its arms while the people suffered. Due to the scarcity of PMS, DAILY POST gathered that some politicians are using it as a measure to seek votes. A former Commissioner for Works in the State, Oluremi Omowaiye on Saturday in Ilesa, was observed freely distributing PMS to commercial motorcyclists from the headquarters of his campaign office. Many residents had also criticised him for endangering the lives of residents and for taking the advantage of PMS scarcity to induce the people. Meanwhile, the protest planned for today, Monday, by the coalition of Osun Civil Societies Organisations over the lingering scarcity of PMS and alleged anti-people policies of the Muhammadu Buhari administration has been postponed indefinitely. In the notice of suspension of the protests which was contained in a statement by the Publicity Secretary of The Peopleâ€™s Advocates, Emmanuel Olowu on Sunday, the postponement came after a thorough review of some developments surrounding the protest.
