The National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission, NSWIC, has declared 100 per cent readiness to tackle emerging workers’ wage challenges. The commission’s Chairman, Mr Ekpo Nta, said this while signing a Memorandum of Understanding, MoU, between the commission and the National Centre for Technology Management, NACETEM, on Wednesday in Abuja. According to him, the commission would continue to reinvent itself for the good of the Nigerian workers. “The Partnership that culminated in the signing of this MoU commenced in 2020 when we received a proposal from NACETEM requesting participants for the training they organise. “The meeting led to a capacity-building exercise for 55 staff in operation and other support departments in NSIWC”, he said. Nta added that government agencies needed to collaborate to better deliver on their mandates.
