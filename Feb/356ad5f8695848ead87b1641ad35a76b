As Nigerians go to the polls on Saturday, Esther Gabriel, a Nigerian beauty queen has urged citizens to elect leaders with demonstrated capacity and ability to turn around the fortunes of the country. In a post shared on her Instagram page, the Nigerian delegate at the 2021 Miss Globe World finale claimed the country has been mismanaged by past leaders. She also advocated for reformation and prompt action to elect visionary, committed and capable leadership. “In the past, we have allowed tribalism, blind loyalty, selfishness religious extremism and sentimentalism take away our democratic rights and power. And in turn denied ourselves the right to freedom, safety, employment and every opportunity we deserve to enjoy as citizens. “We ruined our land and made it unlivable for ourselves and thereafter run away to places we feel are better and safer than ours. “Nigeria as a country has all it takes to be great. Nigeria has everything it takes to give its citizens all that they need to live. But sadly her citizens kept denying themselves that right and opportunity through their political actions and decisions. “Now, here is another opportunity another chance to right our wrongs and make informed and unbiased decisions”. Concerned about the tendency of few who may be interested to vote along tribal and religious lines, she issued a warning, saying, “This is the time as Nigerians to make the decision to either free ourselves from the shackles or continue to live in bondage. “Remember hunger and insecurity does not care about tribe or religion. Vote wisely, Vote right”, she added.
