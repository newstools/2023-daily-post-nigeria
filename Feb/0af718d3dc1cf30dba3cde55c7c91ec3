Juventus coach, Max Allegri has revealed that midfielder, Paul Pogba will play again for the club in three months’ time after he suffered a new injury setback in training. Speaking ahead of Juventus’ Coppa Italia quarter-final tie with Lazio on Thursday night, Allegri revealed that Pogba, who has recovered from knee surgery, pulled up short in training yesterday. He said, “When the players have been back for a long time, I think of Chiesa out for ten months or Paul [Pogba] for six months, since July 23, they are struggling because they’ve to restart a car that has been standing still for a long time. “Pogba did a good workout during the week. Then he had some pain: the engine needs to settle down and there it takes time, as happened with Chiesa.” He added, “Maybe in 2-3 months, he’ll be in optimal condition.” Pogba, 29, left Man United for Juventus in the summer of 2022.
