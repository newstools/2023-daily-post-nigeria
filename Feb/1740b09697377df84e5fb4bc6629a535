The National Deputy Campaign Manager, Obi-Datti Presidential Campaign, David Isaac Balami, has been involved in a car crash. Balami and other Labour Party’s supporters as well as volunteers were involved in a ghastly car crash while on their way from Biu in Borno South. The accident which occurred between Gombe and Biu had Balami’s SUV Prado Jeep damaged as the vehicle ran into the bush. Balami, while confirming the accident to DAILY POST, said no life was lost, but that they had to abandon the vehicle at the scene due to the porous nature of the area. According to him, the area is notorious for Boko Haram activities, hence they were advised to leave there immediately. He said, “Despite the situation, we are not going to retreat in our effort to deliver Borno South for the Labour Party. We are moving forward. “As for the SUV, it’s a sacrifice for Obi’s victory,” he said. Elections are already ongoing in Borno State with situation report of late arrival of BVAS and electoral materials to the state.
