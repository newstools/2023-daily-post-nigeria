President Muhammadu Buhari, on Sunday, sent a message home from Addis Ababa, saying he is fully aware of the hardship of some policies of government and vowed to take appropriate action, while also urging Nigerians to vote for the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. While making the disclosure in a statement, Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to Buhari on media and publicity, stated: “In the campaign message to voters, the President specifically called on “our traditional rulers, religious leaders and parents to warn their followers and wards alike, to not allow themselves to be used by a few to foment trouble”.” Buhari’s message, as contained in the statement, was concise and to the point: “I want to assure you that the Government has taken adequate security measures to allow everyone to come out and cast their votes. I am therefore appealing to everyone to give them the necessary support. “Fellow Nigerians, I want to use this opportunity to thank you again for electing me to be your President on two occasions. “I am not a contestant in this election, but my party, the All Progressives Congress, has a candidate in the person of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. As I mentioned before, Tinubu is a true believer in Nigeria who loves the people and the development of our country. “I am calling on all of you to vote for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. He is reliable, and I trust he will build on our achievements. “Finally, I am fully aware of the current hardship you are facing as a result of some policies of the Government which are meant to bring overall improvement to the country. “I am appealing to you to exercise further patience as we take appropriate measures to ease these hardships. God willing, there will be light at the end of the tunnel.”
