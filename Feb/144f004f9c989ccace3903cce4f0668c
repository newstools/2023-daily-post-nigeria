Arsenal legend, Ian Wright, has urged Manchester United to sign Tottenham Hotspur’s Harry Kane in the summer transfer window. Kane, 29, has long been linked with a move to Man United, but this summer looks like the final realistic opportunity for the Red Devils to sign the England captain, The striker has also attracted interest from the likes of Chelsea, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. Kane will be in the final year of his contract this summer. Talks are yet to be opened over a new extension, and Wright believes Kane will be a proper No.9 for Man United. “[Manchester United] are a Harry Kane away from really kicking on [next season],” Wright told The Kelly and Wrighty Show. ”When you look at Wout Weghorst… Yes I have been surprised with him coming off the No.9 [role] to No.10 and making things happen… but if that is the plan, then Harry Kane is the perfect person to do that. “Marcus Rashford in that form, Alejandro Garnacho with his pace… If Antony kicks on… Everything they have already got going forward with a proper No.9, Man United will be back. “You just feel Man United are not a million miles away [from winning Premier League titles].”
