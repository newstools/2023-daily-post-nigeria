Senate Chief Whip, Orji Uzor Kalu has lamented the hardship emanating from the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN money policy. Senator Kalu, who featured in a Channels Television program on Monday, said the naira scarcity has brought suffering to him and his family. The lawmaker, however, said the policy is right but blamed the timing and other shortfalls of the CBN towards the policy. He said, “You can see the policy is right but I don’t keep money in my house. I am suffering.” “The other day, my house manager told my wife in Abuja that we have no money to cook food. My wife was virtually roaming around and we feed over 250 people every day.
