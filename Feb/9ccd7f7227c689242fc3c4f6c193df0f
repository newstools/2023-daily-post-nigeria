Famous Nollywood actress and filmmaker, Toyin Abraham has responded to critics of her support for the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu. Recall that the actress had earlier in January, during a live interview on a popular television talk show, Your View, said she would be voting for Tinubu because she loves him for the things he has done for her industry. The actress has been called out, insulted, and trolled on social media since her declaration. Speaking amid the backlash, the unbothered Toyin, during a live Instagram session with actress Kemi Afolabi, said those who placed curses on her over her preferred candidate were wasting their time. “If anybody curses me or swears for me, it can’t affect me because I didn’t collect a dime. It’s only those that took money that can be affected. I, Oluwatoyin, didn’t collect money, and neither did I campaign for anyone, but we’re having this discussion because this is my country, I’m Nigerian, and I gave birth to my child here. “Nobody can pay me. I sell my movies in cinemas, I sell them on platforms, I’m making my money, and I’m fine. The point is to choose your candidate, and don’t bully me.”
