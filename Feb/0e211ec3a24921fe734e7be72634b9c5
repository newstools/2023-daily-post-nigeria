The two governors arrived the court room around 8:30am in company of their followers and top government functionaries. The Federal Government is expected to lock horn in legal battle with three states challenging the implementation of the Cashless Policy Regime introduced by the Central Bank of Nigeria. At the time of this report, more than 100 Senior Advocates engaged by the Federal Government and the aggrieved three states have also arrived the court to present the case of their respective clients.
