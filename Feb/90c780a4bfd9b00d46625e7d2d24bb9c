Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has predicted the team between Arsenal and the Citizens who drop a few points will win the Premier League title this season. Arsenal are currently two points ahead of Man City on the Premier League table following a 1-0 win against Leicester on Saturday. Man City, meanwhile, thrashed Bournemouth 4-1 but have played one game extra than the Gunners. Speaking on BBC 606, Guardiola, however, insisted that both Arsenal and Man City will also drop points this season because there are many more matches to go. The Spaniard said, “Many games, still many things are going to happen. “I know how good they [Arsenal] are, I know we cannot drop points, but now they are starting to play Europa League as well. “Many things are going to happen. They’re going to drop points. We are going to drop points. The team who drops less points will be champions.”
