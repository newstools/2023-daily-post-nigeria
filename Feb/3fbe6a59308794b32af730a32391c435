Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has commiserated with the Delta Police Command and families of police officers killed by gunmen in Anambra. Commissioner for Information, Charles Aniagwu briefed reporters on Saturday in Asaba, the capital. The officers were ambushed and killed around 1.30pm on Friday on Ihiala-Orlu Road en route Umuahia while on official duty. They were proceeding as an advanced team for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential rally in Abia. The late lnspectors, Lucky Aleh, Celestine Nwadiokwu and Jude Obuh were attached to the Explosives Ordinance Disposal (EOD) Unit in Government House. “The team veered off from the convoy and took another route different from where the convoy was taking,” the commissioner said. Aniagwu explained that the state government delayed the announcement of the incident because efforts were being made to reach the families. The official said the recurring killings in the South-East region are not healthy for the country because the general elections are close. The Delta government urged security agencies to arrest the killers of the policemen as soon as possible and bring them to justice.
