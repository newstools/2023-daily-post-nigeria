UEFA’s former chief investigator, Yves Leterme, has insisted that he is convinced that Manchester City committed fraud. Leterme said this while reacting to Manchester City being charged with breaking the Premier League’s financial rules. Manchester City was charged by the Premier League on Monday for breaking financial rules more than 100 times over a nine-year period. Pep Guardiola’s side faces the risk of a points deduction or even expulsion from the English top-flight league if found guilty. However, Leterme believes the Premier League has a strong case against Man City. “There was a total lack of transparent flow of financial information. With a battery of lawyers, they did everything they could to counter the work of our auditors. In addition, it turned out that money from sponsorship was actually paid by the owner,” Leterme told Belgian outlet Sporza. “I’m convinced that fraud has been committed by Manchester City. The problem, however, was that UEFA’s ruling could be contested with an arbitration committee, which doesn’t fall under the real judiciary.”
