Popular Nigerian comic actor and comedian, Imeh Bishop Umoh, better called Okon Lagos, has warned politicians not to rig the ongoing February 25 general election. Okon, who gave the warning in a post on his Instagram page, noted that there is a very thin line between sanity and insanity. He said it will be very unwise to mess with the collective destinies of frustrated Nigerians. ”Obviously, there is huge intimidation and rigging, but please, in all we do, let us not rig this election with impunity in such a way that it reflects the total opposite of the general will of already frustrated Nigerians. If not, ENDSARS will seem like a dress rehearsal for the real one. Just my 1kobo advice. ”Now that the long-sleeping, docile giant in us is finally wide awake, please let everyone do their part in doing the right thing at all times, especially while collating the results. In this destiny-defining moment in our lives, there is a very thin line between sanity and insanity. It will be very unwise to mess with the collective destinies of frustrated people”, he stated.
