The Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, FHC, Justice John Tsoho has declared a five-day break for judges. The break is to allow the senior judicial officers participate in Saturday’s presidential and national assembly elections. The judges will halt proceedings after Wednesday’s sitting and resume duty on February 28, three days after the polls. “Your lordships are by this circular letter permitted to observe a short break in order to perform your civic duties,” Tsoho’s directive reads. The FHC, however, advised administrative judges in the Abuja, Lagos and Port Harcourt Judicial Divisions to assign urgent matters during the period. They are to ensure that a judge is designated to cater for the North, South-West, South-South and South-East geo-political zones.
