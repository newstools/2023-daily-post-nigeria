Big Brother Titans housemate, Yemi, has finally ended his relationship with fellow housemate, Blue Aiva. This is coming hours after the show host, Ebuka Obi Uchendu, called Yemi out on Sunday night during the eviction show for visiting Blue Aiva every midnight. Ebuka said, “Yemi leaves Khosi’s bed around 2 am every night to be with Blue Aiva.” After the live show, Yemi was sighted in a viral video on the internet consoling Khosi, who wept bitterly over what she had just discovered. Yemi is seen promising Khosi that he’s ending whatever he has with Blue tonight. Speaking with Blue Aiva just like he promised Khosi, Yemi asked that they keep things cordial between them, as he gave her the go ahead to be with whoever she wanted in the house. “Let’s just be cordial for now. Not like I don’t want to do this, but it’s too much for me right now. I like you, but I don’t think I can be with you and still be with her. it’s fine, if you want to be with another guy. It won’t still change my feelings towards you.”
