A former National Secretary, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, Apostle Dr Emmanuel Nuhu Kure has warned the electorate against allowing their emotions to determine who they will vote for during the elections. Speaking at the monthly National Prayer meeting organized by the Ministry, Apostle Kure who is the Co-Chairman of the Kaduna State Peace Commission, urged the people to cast their vote based on the directive of the Holy spirit and the credibility of the candidate to the growth of Nigeria. According to him, there are always consequences for disobeying the will of God by voting the wrong candidate to power. He explained, “The Holy Spirit wants me to cast my vote for the Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar, which is contrary to my personal desire to support the Candidate of the Labour Party, Mr. Peter Obi.” Kure, who is also the Chairman, Southern Kaduna Christian Leaders Association (SKCLA), reminded the people of Southern Kaduna and the nation at large to ensure they participate actively during the elections by coming out to vote for the people that will meet their yearnings and aspirations and change the narratives of the country. He called on the youths to cooperate with security agents to secure their communities and maintain the peace before, during and after the elections.
