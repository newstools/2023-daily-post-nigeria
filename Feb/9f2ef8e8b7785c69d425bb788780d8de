Arsenal legend, Emmanuel Petit, has urged manager Mikel Arteta to drop Gabriel Martinelli when the Gunners host Manchester City in Wednesday’s Premier League tie at Emirates Stadium. Petit believes Martinelli is ‘physically and mentally tired’ and should not start for Arsenal against Man City. According to him, the Brazilian is having a ‘difficult’ time at the moment, and Leandro Trossard should start ahead of him. “I am not surprised that he is having a difficult time at the moment. He looks tired – mentally and physically,” Petit told Compare Bet. “I would also say he has a tough time due to the tactical setup. With [Oleksandr] Zinchenko tucking inside to the midfield, he does not get the same support as [Bukayo] Saka does on the right side with Ben White.” He added, “Maybe he [Trossard] should start, but I am pretty sure Arteta will start [Gabriel] Martinelli. I think Trossard is a good option, and he’s shown [Mikel] Arteta that he can trust him as a starter in the first eleven.”
