Arsenal legend Ian Wright has hailed Chelsea’s summer signing Joao Felix as a top quality player. Felix returned to the Chelsea lineup against West Ham on Saturday having completed his three-match suspension. The Portuguese fired the Blues ahead in the first half/ slotting in from Enzo Fernandez’s well taken cross. However, Emerson tapped in from the far-post to give the home an equaliser and both sides settled for a 1-1 draw. Speaking on Premier League Productions, Wright, a former Premier League star, said, “Felix is exciting. We saw him in his first game against Fulham. “We know he’s a top top quality player. He’s getting himself into positions. He’s going past people. “He’s passing past people, he’s running and doing everything. He’s very unfortunate not to have two goals. Chelsea has been flowing.”
