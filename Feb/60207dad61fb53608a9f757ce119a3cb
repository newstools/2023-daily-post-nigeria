Former Sunderland striker, Asamoah Gyan and Chelsea legends, John Obi Mikel and Michael Essien have reacted to the death of Christian Atsu, a former Chelsea and Newcastle United winger.

The former Super Eagles captain wrote, “Mikel Obi, “I am deeply saddened by the news of the passing of Christian Atsu, my thoughts and condolences are with his family, friends and everyone affected by this very devastating event.” On his part, Asamoah Gyan wrote on Twitter,”R.I.P Brother.” Similarly, Michael Essien also tweeted, “Rest well King.”
