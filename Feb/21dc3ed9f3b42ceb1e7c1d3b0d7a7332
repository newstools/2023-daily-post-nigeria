The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has deployed 3,508 units of the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System, BVAS, for the Presidential, House of Representatives and State House Assembly elections in Kogi State. The Kogi State Independent National Electoral Commission Resident Electoral Commissioner, Dr Gabriel Longpet, disclosed this during a press briefing with journalists in Lokoja on Tuesday. Longpet said Kogi State has a total of 1.9 million people expected to vote during the February 25 election. He acknowledged that there are some BVAS that malfunctioned during the INEC mock exercise, stressing that they have been replaced as INEC has many backups in case any machine fails. He said INEC has sent materials to all local government areas, adding that they have inspected the Central Bank of Nigeria on the materials sent to Kogi State. He said the materials sent to Kogi were for the Presidential, Senatorial, House of Representatives, and House of Assembly elections. According to him, the issue of security is paramount to the conduct of the election, stressing that the safety of voters in exercising their rights will be guaranteed. Longpet noted that the commission has had incidents of reports where some political parties were denied from holding their rallies, stressing that, security agencies have been informed about the ugly development. The INEC REC hinted that security agencies had given the Commission assurance that all voters, including their staff, will be safe before, during and after the election. He posited that there would be restrictions of movement on election day, adding that INEC is fully committed to a transparent, free and fair election.
