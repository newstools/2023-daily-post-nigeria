The chairman of APC in Cross River State, Barrister Alphonsus Eba has alleged that those that ‘sold’ Bakassi did not use such money to develop the area. He said the money was diverted to other purposes leaving Bakassi without infrastructure. He spoke during the party’s electioneering campaign at Ekpri Ikang town in Bakassi LGA of the state. He commended Governor Ben Ayade for remembering the people by building a resettlement estate, a deep seaport and a superhighway from Bakassi to the fringes of Benue State. Also speaking in the same vein, the governorship candidate of the party, Prince Bassey Otu assured that his government will revisit the 76 oil wells which the Supreme Court ruled that they belong to Akwa Ibom State. “If I am elected the next governor the issue of the 76 oil wells which were ceded to a neighbouring state will be addressed,” he said. According to him, the previous administrations in the state did not have the capacity to address the issues affecting the state. “If I could do so much for the people when I was in the House of Representatives and Senate without a budget, the people should expect more from me when I am the state governor,” he stated. Also speaking, Senator Florence Ita Giwa, who spoke on behalf of the people of Bakassi, disclosed that she was asked to leave the room before the Green Tree Agreement, which ceded a part of Bakassi to Cameroon, was signed in New York. She also commended Governor Ben Ayade for his industrialization programme. Ita Giwa said rather than follow those that sold the state, they should follow the product which is being presented by Ayade, who knows what is good for the state. Earlier, Governor Ben Ayade described the turnout as the biggest crowd he had ever seen in the area and described the ongoing Bakassi Deep Seaport and the superhighway as well as the displaced people resettlement estate as laudable projects with high potential in the area.
