Manchester United manager, Erik ten Hag, has confirmed that Antony and Harry Maguire will be available for selection for his side’s UEFA Europa League second-leg tie against Barcelona on Thursday. Ten Hag also confirmed that Anthony Martial will not take part in Man United’s clash with Barcelona at Old Trafford. The Dutchman spoke on Wednesday during his pre-match press conference. Recall that Antony has missed Man United’s last four games with a leg injury, while Maguire suffered a knee injury ahead of the Red Devils’ Premier League win over Leicester City. “We still have training [session] to go, but I expect Maguire and Antony available,” Ten Hag said. “Anthony Martial is not available. He is back on the pitch, but we wait for team training.” Meanwhile, Martial has struggled with a hip problem in recent weeks.
