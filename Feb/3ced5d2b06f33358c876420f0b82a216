Poor marksmanship cost Remo Stars a positive result in Monday’s Nigeria Premier Football League matchday nine clash, according to head coach Daniel Ogunmodede. The Sky Blue Stars succumbed to a 2-0 defeat to their hosts at the New Jos Stadium. Joshua John and Emmanuel Ogbole got the goals for the Solid Miners. “It’s not a favourable result for us. They had an early chance and took it. We had ours, never took them,” Ogunmodede said during his interaction with the media. “This is not a good way to end the first round. My team played to instructions but weren’t efficient enough.” Remo Stars sit in fourth position on the Group A table with 14 points from nine matches.
