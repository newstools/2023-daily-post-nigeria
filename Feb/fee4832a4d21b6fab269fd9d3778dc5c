The APC National Vice Chairman, South East, Dr Ijeomah Arodiogbu, has urged the people of the Southeast geopolitical region to shun regional sentiment and be wise enough to key into central politics and government to remain actively relevant. Arodiogbu said when the APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, wins the presidential election, the Igbo would be largely incorporated into central power for even development of the region. The APC chieftain, who stated this while fielding questions from DAILY POST, enjoined the people of South East to massively give their votes to the APC presidential candidate to enable him win the presidential election. While expressing optimism that APC will retain power at the centre, Arodiogbu said: “Let us key into the power at the centre. And I am very confident that under my watch as the APC National Vice Chairman, South East, in this 2023 election, the South East will give support to APC. “We have won the presidential election already. The crowd we see during our presidential rally in Owerri today is overwhelming, despite the cash crunch. For people to use their personal money to assemble here today shows they love APC. It is awesome, it is great. Tinubu is the best candidate in the presidential race. We cannot be deceived by folktales by drama artists. Tinubu is going to win the election and Nigerians will be happy for it”.
