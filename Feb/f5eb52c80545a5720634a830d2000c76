The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has said the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Governor, Godwin Emefiele does not have the money to fund its activities. IPOB accused the Department of State Services, DSS, of plotting to humiliate Emefiele out of office by making such claims. IPOB’s spokesman, Emma Powerful, made the remark while denying DSS’ claims of Emefiele funding the separatist group. Powerful described the report credited to the DSS as lies. A statement by Powerful said Emefiele does not have the money to fund IPOB because the group is bigger than him. The statement reads partly: “The attention of the global movement and family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) ably led by the indefatigable liberator, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has been drawn to the childish and fabricated lies from Nigeria Secret Police, Department of State Services (DSS) accusing Godwin Emefele, the Central Bank of Nigeria Governor (CBN), of funding the great movement of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). “For record sake, IPOB doesn’t know the person called Godwin Emefele. We just know that he is the man in charge of the corrupt financial institution they call CBN. “Godwin Emefele doesn’t have money to finance IPOB because IPOB is bigger than him, his government entity, including the DSS making such spurious idiotic and insulting allegation.” Powerful said IPOB was being funded by its members across the world. “IPOB movement is being financed and sponsored by its members scattered all over the world through our free will financial support. “DSS can’t claim ignorance of such sources of funding of IPOB because they have the intelligence unless they want to tell the world that they are daft,” he added.
