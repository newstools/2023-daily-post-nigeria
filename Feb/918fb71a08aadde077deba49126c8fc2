Popular Nollywood actress, Eniola Badmus has begun the distribution of the asoebi selected for the celebration and swearing-in ceremony of the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate Bola Tinubu whom she believes will be the next President of Nigeria. Showing off the Kampala fabric on her Instagram page, she called for those interested to reach out to her so that more fabrics could be produced. The actress wrote: “Swearing in Kampala is ready, holla if you want.” It is no longer news that Eniola Badmus has been one of the many celebrities who boldly flaunt their support for Tinubu. Recall that she had a few weeks ago, in a post shared on Instagram, said, “Let it be known that if Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu wins this election, it’s not because his party is the ruling party. It’s because of the faith Nigerians have in him personally.”
