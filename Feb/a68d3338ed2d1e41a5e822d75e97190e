Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has said that midfielder Thomas Partey will be assessed in training today before a decision is made on whether he will feature for the Gunners in their Premier League tie against Everton on Wednesday night at Emirates Stadium. Partey missed Arsenal’s matches against Manchester City and Aston Villa earlier this month through injury. The Ghanaian international made his comeback in Saturday’s 1-0 win against Leicester City, but he only managed six minutes after coming off the bench in the closing stages. Speaking at his pre-match press conference ahead of Arsenal’s clash with Everton, Arteta said Partey is back in contention, “He [Partey] has not obviously trained much he only had a session, and he will train today,” Arteta said. “It’s what it is. He was out for a few weeks, and he needs to get the rhythm.” The kick-off time for the match is 8.45 pm.
