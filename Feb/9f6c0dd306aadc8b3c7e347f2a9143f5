The Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC) has appealed to the public to stop attacking bank workers, saying they are also victims of the cash crisis facing the nation. The congress made the appeal in a statement signed by its President, Mr Festus Osifo, and Secretary General, Mr Nuhu Toro, on Monday, in Lagos State. It said that bank and financial institution employees at junior and senior staff levels were mere workers who dispense only currencies made available to different banks by the regulatory agencies. The statement read in part, “Our fellow compatriots should realise that bank staff are like other Nigerians, victims of the poor implementation of the new currency design policy. “They suffer like other Nigerians as they also have families to cater for and personal financial needs to meet. “The TUC appeals to the Nigerian masses not to be provoked, and where they choose to publicly demonstrate their feelings, which is their human right, to do so peacefully.”
