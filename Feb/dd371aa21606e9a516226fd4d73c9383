Senator Adamu Aliero has boasted that the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, will beat the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, in Kebbi State. The former governor representing Kebbi Central in the Senate spoke in Birnin Kebbi, the capital, on Monday. Aliero addressed admirers and party members on his return to Kebbi after his victory at the Supreme Court last week. The apex court authenticated the ex-Federal Capital Territory Minister as the PDP flagbearer for Kebbi Central District. The lead judgment by Justice Centus Nweze, read by Justice Amina Augie, set aside the judgment of the lower court which declared Saidu Haruna as the winner. “PDP today is united; all aggrieved members have resolved their differences,” Aliero said. “We have come together as one big family and we are now ready to wrest power from the incumbent.” Aliero alleged that the Kebbi government collected lots of funds from the federation account but had nothing to show for it. The lawmaker charged the people to help the PDP reclaim power in the State and at the national level. PDP gubernatorial candidate, retired Maj-Gen. Aminu Bande said the crowd at the event was massive and urged supporters to show the same support on election days.
