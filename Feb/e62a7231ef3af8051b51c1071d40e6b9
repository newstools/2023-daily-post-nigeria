Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun Central, Olumide Aderinokun, has rejected the outcome of Saturday’s senatorial election. Aderinokun said the election was marred with irregularities, which included over voting and some other electoral malpractices. DAILY POST reports that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has on Sunday announced that Aderinokun polled 52,940 votes, while the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Shuaib Salisu got a total of 96,769 votes. Alsom candidate of the Labour Party, Collins Abayomi came third with 27,884 votes. But, Aderinokun has rejected the result, saying “there are over 100 polling units in Ogun Central that had over-voting.” Chief Aderinokun, who spoke through his media aide, Taiye Taiwo, faulted the INEC for the “irregularities” that shaped the election across the six local governments of Ogun Central Senatorial District, starting from polling units to ward levels. “The good people of Ogun Central have been robbed. The system failed the people and Chief Aderinokun with the backing of the PDP family in Ogun State will not be accepting it,” it was said. Taiwo said “the Ogun Central result will be challenged because it doesn’t reflect the will of the people in Ogun Central.” He alleged that “there were many cases of over voting, non-usage of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), delay in uploading of results and inconsistencies with numbers of voters and the results. “The process was rigged and we won’t fold our hands to be cheated. We are heading to the election tribunal and we encourage the people to be watchful and desist from acts capable of instigating violence,” he concluded.
