Youths in Sagamu went on the rampage on Monday morning, following their inability to withdraw cash from any Bank or Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). As early as 8am, the angry youths took to the streets to show their displeasure. The angry reaction from the youths followed the inability of banks and their ATM to dispense cash soon after President Muhammadu Buhari ordered them to recirculate the old N200 notes.  With bonfires, the protesters barricaded the Sagamu-Benin expressway and other routes, preventing human and vehicular movements. Meanwhile, the Akarigbo of Remo, Oba Babatunde Ajayi, has called for calm. A statement signed by the Oba read: “I appeal to all to remain calm and peaceful as we continue to engage the Federal Government. “This policy is not from the State or local government. Therefore, the destruction of lives and properties will only compound an already bad situation.  “I urge our people to continue to accept the old notes in line with the Supreme Court ruling. No person who accepts the old notes would lose out. I can assure you of that, and please hold on to that promise.” “Further, I am also mandating all our market people to continue to accept the old notes. I hereby undertake that no one will lose out for possessing the old notes.”
