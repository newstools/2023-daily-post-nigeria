A coalition of political parties on Monday threatened to boycott the forthcoming election if President Muhammadu Buhari bowed to pressure and suspend the implementation of the Central Bank of Nigeria’s naira redesign policy. The parties said they would not be interested in the elections if CBN’s new deadline of February 10, 2023, for the validity of old notes is shifted. The national chairman of the Action Alliance, AA, Kenneth Udeze, who briefed journalists in Abuja, said 13 out of 18 political parties will not partake in the 25th February election if Buhari halted the implementation of the naira redesign policy. The coalition also condemned Kogi, Kaduna, and Zamfara states governors for taking Buhari and CBN to court over the policy. Expressing support for the apex bank’s naira redesign policy implementation despite the attendant hardship Nigerians are experiencing, the coalition stated: “We, as a result of this, announce that at least 13 of the 18 political parties in Nigeria will not be interested in the 2023 general elections, and indeed we shall withdraw our participation from the electoral process if this currency policy is suspended or cancelled or if the deadline is further shifted.”
