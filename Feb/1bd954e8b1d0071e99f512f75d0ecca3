One person was reportedly shot in Sapon, a neighbourhood of Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, following attempts by some persons to rob a branch of the First Bank of Nigeria in the area. DAILY POST reported earlier that the crisis started on Tuesday when some bank customers spent hours at a branch of GTBank in Asero area of Abeokuta. The protests spread to other parts of Abeokuta such as Sapon, Panseke, Okelewo and others, affecting commercial activities. A reliable source told DAILY POST the bank became the target of some hoodlums, who were said to have hijacked the protest in an attempt to rob the First Bank branch. According to multiple sources, armed hoodlums besieged and tried to force their way inside after the canopy in front of the bank had earlier been set on fire and properties on the premises vandalised. “In a bid to stop the invasion of the bank, armed policemen raced to the scene and there was an exchange of gunshots between them and the area boys. “During the confrontation, the bullet hit a young man and he was rushed to the hospital. We have not got any update so far,” a source told DAILY POST correspondent anonymously. Meanwhile, the Ogun State police command has warned youths to remain calm, saying it would deal decisively with anyone causing chaos in the State.
