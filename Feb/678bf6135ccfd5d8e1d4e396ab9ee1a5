A Senior Secondary School 2 student of Owena Community Grammar School, Owena, Ondo East Local Government Area of Ondo State, Mwafor Emmanuel, has been found dead in a river. The 19-year-old student reportedly drowned in a river behind his school. A teacher in the school, who spoke in confidence, said: “The incident happened after school hours. Other students had gone to their houses when the boy decided to go and swim alone. He removed his uniform and sandals before jumping into the river. He must have drowned when he went deeper inside the river. “Unfortunately, he may have been rescued if other students were with him at the time of the incident. They would have raised the alarm. But he went alone to swim.” Police detectives were invited the next morning when his corpse was discovered by a passerby and deposited at the State’s General Hospital in Ondo town. Confirming the incident, the State police spokesperson, Funmi Odunlami, described the death as unfortunate.
