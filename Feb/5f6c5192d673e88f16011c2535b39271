The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Imo State has called on INEC to reject alleged concocted results from Ihube, Agbobu, Umuowaibu, Aku, Umulolo, Ogii and Amuro wards where election did not hold due to the high-level insecurity in Okigwe Local Government Area of the State. The opposition party cautioned that INEC must never lend Senator Uzodinma the hand with which to strangle democracy in Nigeria. PDP stated this in a statement signed by Collins Opurozor, its State Publicity Secretary, and made available to DAILY POST in Owerri, Imo State. The party further alleged that by the dawn of today, agents of the Hope Uzodinma-led administration began to appear with fake and manufactured results from these wards. The release reads in parts:” To achieve their intention of rigging the elections, they have brought armed men in armoured personnel carriers to take over the INEC office in Okigwe LGA, where they now also compel INEC officials to accept and transmit the fake results with all brutality. “Our party describes this as treasonable and regrets that all the efforts made to sanitize the country’s electoral system have been eroded through the desperation and anti-democratic acts of Senator Hope Uzodinma. “Our party calls on INEC to reject the concocted results from the affected wards, and cautions that INEC must never lend Senator Uzodinma the hand with which to strangle democracy in Nigeria.”
