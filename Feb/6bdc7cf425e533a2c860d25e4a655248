The Conference of Northern States Civil Society Networks has declared President Muhammadu Buhari’s extension of the use of the old N200 to April 10 as evidence that he meant well for Nigerians. The extension of the usage of the old N200 notes, they noted, would ameliorate the suffering of the masses. In the same vein, they called on the Federal Government and the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, to make available the lower denominations of N5, N10, N20, N50 and N100 while stressing that Nigeria would be better off at the end of the day. The civil societies organisations from 19 northern states, meeting at the Chilla Hotel Kano, further alleged that the civil society group protesting against the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crime Commission, EFCC, AbduRasheed Bawa, were sponsored by some disgruntled politicians facing fraud charges. Speaking on behalf of the group, Ambassador Ibrahim Waiya, Chairman of Kano Civil Society Networks, said no amount of hiring of civil society organizations and staging of phoney protests on streets would save politicians facing corruption charges. Waiya said: “The most unfortunate behaviour of this kind of Civil Society Networks is their tendencies of allowing themselves to be misled by some politicians without recourse to humanity, service to the nation [and] duty towards the promotion of genuine cause such as the fight against corruption and corrupt practices.” He added: “We, therefore, as Conference of Northern States Civil Society Networks, wish to categorically put on record that the groups protesting in some parts of Lagos do not represent the Civil Society Networks from all over Nigeria and they are not speaking on our behalf because we do not share in the called for the sack of [the] EFCC Chairman.” The Northern States Civil Society passed a vote of confidence on the EFCC chair, noting that he has an outstanding record of recoveries of stolen funds and arrests and convictions of 2,220 offenders between January and December 2021. The conference urged President Buhari to disregard the call for the sack of the EFCC chair by paid protesters sponsored by a state governor whose family is enmeshed in allegations of corruption.
