The Presidency has accused the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, of trying to cause a division between President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu a few weeks before the 2023 elections. Buhari’s spokesman, Garba Shehu, said PDP attempted to use the stone-pelting incident to malign Buhari and APC’s image. Shehu described the stone attack on Buhari as fake news being pushed by the PDP. Reports had it that Buhari was stoned at the Hotoro area of Kano during his visit on Monday. Reacting, PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, had accused Tinubu of hiring thugs to attack Buhari during his visit to Kano State. However, Shehu said condemning a fake incident was mere crocodile tears meant to cause disaffection. He warned that portraying such falsehood would not ensure PDP’s victory at the presidential election. A statement by Shehu reads:” We have seen fake reports of stone-pelting incident that took place at Hotoro area of Kano on the day of the visit to the city by President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday, an incident, even if minor, that should stand condemned by all well-meaning citizens. “The divisive rhetoric of an opposition in a futile attempt to malign the image of the President and the candidates of the All Progressives Congress in the coming elections, and its desperate wedge-driving activities to cause a division between the party and the government is not what will give them victory. “The PDP should use the opportunity of the electioneering to put their point of view in a democracy. When problems can be resolved through talks, there is no place for stone-pelting, arson and unruly behaviour as we are witnessing in some of the campaigns.”
