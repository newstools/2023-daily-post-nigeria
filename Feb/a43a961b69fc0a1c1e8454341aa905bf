Fish sellers in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital on Tuesday protested the rejection of old naira notes by commercial banks and business owners in the state. DAILY POST reported yesterday that banks, filling stations and supermarkets in Ogun State are no longer accepting the old notes. This has affected small and medium scale businesses in the state as the new notes are nowhere to be found. On Wednesday, market women lamented their inability to buy goods due to the enforcement of the cashless policy by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Crying and shouting on top of their voices, the women decried the CBN policy, which they said has caused them a lot of hardships. The traders said the rejection of the old naira notes by wholesalers at various ‘cold rooms’ has turned them into jobless women. Speaking on behalf of the fish sellers, Mrs Rasheedat Oyebola, said: “We have tried all that we could but to no avail, that is why we have decided to go round today to explain our plights to Nigerians so the CBN governor can have mercy on us. “Some of us here today are single parents and we have been struggling all our lives. If the money we have are refused as legal tender some of us may die of hunger and poverty. “We appeal to everyone who can help us to as a matter of urgency come to our aid.”
