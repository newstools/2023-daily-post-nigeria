Prof. Bolaji Akinyemi, a former Minister of External Affairs, has urged Nigerians to think carefully and vote according to their conscience during the coming general elections for a better country. Akinyemi gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) during the Luncheon and Merit Awards ceremony to mark Igbobi College’s 91st Anniversary at the school in Lagos on Sunday. According to him, Nigerian citizens should act in such a manner because the young generation needs a country that will reward merit and hard work. He said that the country needs “a round peg in a round hole” that would not only make the required impact locally but also make sure the country is in its rightful place internationally. “This is because the world is going through a transition from the old order to the new, and there’s a need for Nigeria to sit at the table of decisions in the world. “Nigeria’s seat should not be vacant at the world table where decisions are being taken so that we can have an active foreign policy for the betterment of the country,” he said.
