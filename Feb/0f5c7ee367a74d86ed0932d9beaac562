Solomon Agbalaka scored the decisive goal as the Flying Eagles of Nigeria defeated hosts Egypt 1-0 to record their first win at the 2023 Africa U-20 Cup of Nations. Agbalaka nodded home powerfully from Aminu Muhammadu’s corner-kick in the 71st minute. The Flying Eagles moved from bottom to second position on the table following the hard-fought win. Egypt dominated the opening exchanges but the Flying Eagles improved later in the game. Ladan Bosso’s side finished the first half the better side but failed to carve out any real goal scoring opportunity. Egypt regained control of the game after the break as they looked to impress the sparse crowd at the Cairo International Stadium. Nigeria goalkeeper, Chijioke Anigboso produced two superb saves to deny the Young Pharaohs in the 63rd and 65th minutes respectively. Left-back Agbalaka then popped in with the winner from a great header 19 minutes from time. The Flying Eagles will face Mozambique in their last group game on Saturday knowing that a win will guarantee them a place in the quarter-finals.
