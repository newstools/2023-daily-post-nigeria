President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday charged university administrators that would be engaged with different support services in the 2023 general elections to uphold a high degree of professionalism. Speaking at the weekend at the 36/37 combined convocation of Bayero University Kano, Buhari insisted that his administration would provide a level playing field for the smooth implementation of the electoral process in Nigeria. He said, “I urge those who’ll be involved in the elections to play their roles with the usual dignity and transparency for which our academics are very well known. “There’s no doubt that the participation of academics and other staff of universities in our country’s general elections over the years has lent more credibility and respectability to Nigeria’s democratic processes.” The president, represented by the Executive Secretary of the National Universities Commission, Prof. Abubakar Rasheed, also called on all Nigerians to work for the success of the elections to help move Nigeria forward. Buhari also enjoined Nigerian universities to make sure that the quality of their graduates measures up to world standards.
