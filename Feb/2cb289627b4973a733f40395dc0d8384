A member of the Tinubu/Shettima Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) in Taraba State, Abdulrazaq Gidado, on Friday, resigned from his appointment to pitch tent with the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. The former All Progressives Congress PCC member who said he decamped to PDP to work for the success of PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, attributed his action to the ongoing internal wrangling in the state chapter of APC and claimed that more APC members are on the verge of ditching the party for PDP. His decision to leave the APC, according to him, “was because of how the state chapter of the party is run and the seeming selfishness of some party members who are only concerned with their personal interests.” Gidado also claimed he has been officially welcomed to the PDP by the state governor, Darius Dickson Ishaku. He said: “I have decided to withdraw my membership from APC. Before leaving, I was a member of the Presidential Campaign Council, a member of the APC Legal Committee of the 2022 APC Convention and an aspirant for Taraba APC state chairman. I am [in PDP] to work for the success of all the candidates, from the state House of Assembly to the Presidency.” Gidado, also a former guber candidate of the United Democratic Party, UDP, said he is not only leaving the APC but also going along with his political structures to the PDP. “I am moving with my structure of over 100 persons per ward totalling over 20,000 members who have voluntarily decided to follow me out of loyalty and frustration with developments in our party,” he said. The internal wrangling bedevilling the state chapter of the party has led to the cancellation of the APC PCC rally in the state on three occasions.
