There are reports of the fatal shooting of a youth identified as Ojochenemi Akayaba in Kogi State, after allegedly snatching a ballot box. What started as peaceful presidential and National Assembly polls in Dekina Local Government Area were scuttled. Some suspected political thugs went round to disrupt voting at different polling units within the council. They attacked locations at Dekina town, Anyigba and Abocho communities, destroying Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, materials. Ballot papers and boxes were also snatched or destroyed at some units at Udaba-Dekina and Tudunwada. DAILY POST gathered that Akayaba was “shot dead” after snatching a ballot box at Agwudoko area in Anyigba. It is believed he was gunned down by security operatives. A photo on social media shows the graduate lying lifeless. Akayaba is an alumnus of Prince Abubakar Audu University. He studied Political Science and recently completed his National Youth Service Corps, NYSC.
