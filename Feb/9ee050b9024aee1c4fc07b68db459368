Ahead of the presidential election, a former Nigerian lawmaker and social critic, Senator Shehu Sani, says Governor Nyesom Wike-led G5 governors are playing hard to get. Sani also said their endorsement would soon become irrelevant as voters might have made up their minds about their preferred candidates. The statement was contained in a post via his verified Twitter handle on Tuesday. Recall that the G5 Governors have been engaged in a political battle with the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, over control of the party. As a result, they refused to openly support him for the forthcoming presidential election. Although the group of five governors had said they would announce their candidate in January, that is yet to come. Meanwhile, Sani says the clock is ticking, noting that their endorsement might not matter after all. He wrote, “The G5 have been playing hard to get. The clock is ticking. When the masses they control have made up their mind, endorsement will be irrelevant.”
