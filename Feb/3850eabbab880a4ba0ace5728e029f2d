Former Liverpool star, Danny Murphy, has urged manager Jurgen Klopp to sell six players in his squad after Tuesday’s UEFA Champions League round of 16 first-leg humiliating 5-2 defeat against Real Madrid at Anfield. The six players are Joel Matip, James Milner, Fabinho, Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and one of his attackers. Murphy told talkSPORT: “I think it is time for a big reset, I think there are going to be five or six gone in the summer. “I think Klopp knows, Klopp will get the opportunity to fix this, and he deserves that opportunity, a hundred percent. “I think most [Liverpool] fans are with me on that.” When asked which players could be heading out the door of Liverpool, Murphy added: “Well, I think there are some obvious ones who are nearing the end of their contracts or career. “When you have got Keita, Ox, Milner is near the end, that is three in midfield, that leaves space then. “You could probably throw Fabinho in there, maybe, depending on how much you could get for him to get someone younger in that role with more energy. “Matip has been there seven or eight years. Matip has been great by the way, it is not a criticism of him, but there is a time when the squad has to evolve. “Six forwards for three positions unless he changes his tactics. We have got Gakpo, Diaz, Jota, Bobby Firmino, Mo Salah and Nunez. “We don’t need six, so one of them might go as well, but he has got to free up some space to bring in some new energy.”
