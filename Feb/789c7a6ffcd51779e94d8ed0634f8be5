Sky Sports pundit, Gary Neville, has claimed Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal are demanding the Premier League punish Manchester City because they are jealous. The Premier League this week charged City with committing multiple financial rule breaches across a nine-year period. The governing body has referred the case to an independent commission. City have dominated the domestic scene in England since its new owners arrived and especially with the hiring of Pep Guardiola as manager. “There’s been massive respect towards Manchester City over the last seven or eight years, in terms of what we’ve seen on the pitch. “They are determined that they’ve not done anything wrong, and I feel as if they don’t like the idea of the established elite not liking what they are doing. “Clubs like Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal – the historic, traditional big clubs, don’t like this idea of the newcomer coming on the block and doing what they’re doing,” Neville said.
