The Zamfara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has reacted to the claim by the former Deputy Governor of the state, Barrister Mahdi Aliyu Gusau, that he has discovered 16 wards where elections will not hold. In a press statement issued by the State APC Publicity Secretary, Mallam Yusuf Idris Gusau, the party challenged the former Deputy Governor to mention the bandits’ locations in the state. “APC and the state government want to immensely thank the lawyer politician for this good information that will help in ensuring the disbandment of the criminals wherever they may be in our dear state. “As has always been the plea of Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle for all well meaning Zamfara State citizens to join hands with his administration in sacking all terror groups and enclaves from the state. “We also wish to urgently implore security agencies in the state to immediately invite Barrister Mahdi, who had visited such wards, to help with more details of his findings to save the state and its good citizens. ‘We have always been saying that members of the opposition PDP know some, if not all, of the bandits in the state; this will certainly be an opportunity for the PDP to use such knowledge positively by divulging information that will help the state. “The PDP and the former Deputy Governor, in particular, owe it as a duty to the state to immediately give details on this matter. “It must, however, be noted that banditry and other heinous crimes have significantly been decimated in Zamfara State and other parts of the North West through the sustained efforts of the federal and state governments,” the statement read.
