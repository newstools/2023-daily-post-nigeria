There is anger in Enugu State over the non-arrival of Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, officials in most of the polling units in the State. DAILY POST reports that as early as 7 am residents have flooded various polling units eager to cast their votes. However, as of the time of filing this report, INEC officials were nowhere to be found in many parts of the State. From Enugu metropolis, Nsukka zone, Enugu West and several other parts of the State, the report is the same. An angry voter told DAILY POST, “we have been here at the Uwani since 7 am but right now, 11 am, no single material has been sighted. “This is bad; is this how they want to rig the election? “We are calling on the international community to take note of what the INEC is doing.”
