Former Manchester United captain, Roy Keane told manager Erik ten Hag to resign after he was seen dancing following their Carabao Cup win. Ten Hag lifted his first piece of silverware with the Red Devils, following a 2-0 win over Newcastle on Sunday. It also ended United’s six-year wait for a trophy. Antony and Lisandro Martinez, who followed Ten Hag to United from Ajax, were seen donning their country’s flags as they celebrated with Ten Hag, before breaking out into a dance that the coach also got involved with. It led to Keane jokingly asking Ten Hag to leave. Keane said on Sky Sports: “You should resign after that”. Ten Hag replied: “Never. We have a history with that (from Ajax). I hope we can do it more often.”
