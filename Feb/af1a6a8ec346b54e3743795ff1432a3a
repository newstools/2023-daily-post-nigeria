A post shared on social media by a user simply called Bello who was present at the scene of the incident disclosed that the singer was attacked with his phone stolen. He wrote: “Falz and other voters have just been attacked, and his phone has been stolen at Ikate Lekki. Ballot papers are being torn apart and scattered by the area boys there. They saw the support for the Labour Party and could not take it. “Emergency services needed right away. Voters that live close to the polling unit have gone back into their homes for safety. They are still seizing people’s phones.” In another update, Bello wrote: ”My friend just called me right now crying out of fear for these people. The security and police at Ikate must intervene quickly, please.”
