Barcelona manager, Xavi Hernandez has told his stars that they put in their “worst performance of the season” after losing 1-0 at Almeria on Sunday. The LaLiga leaders missed the chance to move 10 points clear of Real Madrid. El Bilal Toure scored the crucial goal in the match to end Barca’s 13-game unbeaten streak in the league. It is only the second time Barca have tasted defeat in LaLiga. “I am really angry. It was the worst game of the season from my point of view. “It was a day to make a statement in LaLiga, and there is no excuse. “There was no intensity, there was not even a desire to win, and that worries me. “We slipped up and we apologise to the fans,” Xavi said.
