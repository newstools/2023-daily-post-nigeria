Famous Nollywood actress and filmmaker, Toyin Abraham has shared the mystery of her birth and her spirituality. Toyin in an interview with Vanessa Obioha, spoke about her spiritual gifts, alongside other milestones. The actress explained that it took the spiritual intervention of a cleric to resurrect her after her parents threw her away after birth because she was stillborn. She said: “One of the problems I encountered back then was because I didn’t listen to myself. I’m extremely spiritual. I do hear the voice of the Lord and also see it in my dreams, but I would want to follow my flesh. ”But ever since I began to follow the lead of the Holy Spirit, things drastically changed for me. Since birth, I have been spiritual because I’m actually a dada – those people that naturally have dreadlocks from birth. ”Then there was a clergyman from Ibadan in Oyo State, who visited the hospital and asked about me, and I was brought back to life. I was told that I never did anything or cried until the moment they named me Oluwatoyin on the day of my naming ceremony, that I started to cry as a baby. ”Again, when they wanted to barb my locks, they had to tell me it was from the Holy Spirit because I did not want them to do it.”
