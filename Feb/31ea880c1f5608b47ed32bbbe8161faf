With six days to the presidential election, the Senior Pastor of Dunamis International Gospel Centre, Paul Enenche has warned soldiers, policemen and operatives of the Department of State Services, DSS, officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, against assisting politicians to rig the poll. Enenche warned that INEC officials, soldiers and policemen would be answerable to God if they assist any politician to manipulate election results. He issued the warning while speaking in Makurdi, the Benue State capital on Friday night. According to Enenche: “Police people, military people, SSS people, let me take the liberty to appreciate the effort of all security apparatus, INEC staff. When you are on your duty post, know that you will be answerable to God if you assist anybody to rig. When you go before Jehovah he will ask you if somebody won and you assisted them to win. “God will ask on the judgment day that killers want to finish his beloved country of Nigeria and you still assisted them into power. Don’t do anything extra, just do your work. Just stand and be vigilant and just be sure that nobody manipulates any result under your watch. “They are soldiers, you are soldiers; they are police and you are police. You will not manipulate this result under my nose. “You are not taking this paper anywhere, we will finish it here and send the result from here. Send this instruction to all your brothers who are soldiers, policemen, INEC staff that you know. “Warn them, counsel and advice them that they have the blood of a nation on their hands If they assist any killer to rig election and if they have blood to give to God when they meet him in judgment then they can go ahead.”
