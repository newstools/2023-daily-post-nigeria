Two people were on Wednesday charged at an Ikeja Chief Magistrate’s Court for allegedly obtaining N13 million on the false pretence of changing it to dollars. The defendants are Christina Oyeleye, a woman, 39, banker, resident at 7, Adeagbo St., Abule Egba and Adelana Adewusi, 39, a tech man, resident at Oko Oba, Agege, Lagos. They are being tried for conspiracy, obtaining by false pretence, stealing and issuing a dud cheque. The prosecutor, ASP Raji Akeem, told the court that the offences were committed on October 7, 2022, at Oko Oba, Agege, Lagos. Akeem said that the second defendant, Adewusi, introduced the first defendant to Mrs Esther Adesanya as a banker that could help her change the naira to the dollar. Akeem said that the complainant paid N13 million into the second defendant’s account to help her send it to the first defendant to change it to dollars which amounted to $14,000. The prosecutor said that since then, all efforts by the complainant to get her money have failed. The prosecutor also said that the defendants gave the complainant a cheque, and on getting to the bank, it was dishonoured because of insufficient funds. The offences, according to the prosecutor, contravened the Criminal Code, Law of Lagos State, 2015. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Bola Osunsanmi, granted the defendants bail of N1 million each with two sureties in like sum. Osunsanmi adjourned the case until March 30 for mention.
