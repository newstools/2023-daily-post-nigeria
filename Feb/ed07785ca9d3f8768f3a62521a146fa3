Former Manchester United attacker, Louis Saha, has criticised the performances of the club’s new January signing, Wout Weghorst. Saha said that Weghorst is struggling to link up with his Man United teammates after he once again failed to score in their Premier League 2-0 against Leeds United over the weekend. “I don’t want to be someone who gets on Wout Weghorst’s back, but he is struggling to link up with other players,” Saha told Paddy Power. “He is finding it difficult to find the technical aspect that a Manchester United striker needs. “He made eight appearances, and it was an unbelievable offer for Weghorst from Manchester United, but it is a difficult one because a player in this position needs goals, assists and to impact the game and it is not just enough to have good energy. “He should get the ball under control more often because he should not struggle for composure. ‘It is a bit harsh but I want to see way more from him. He is way off what we expect at Manchester United.”
