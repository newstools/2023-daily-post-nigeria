The Lagos State Police Command has brought the Thursday morning situation in the Mile 12 axis under control. Other areas that witnessed civil disorder were Ketu, Ojota and Ikorodu; scores of demonstrators blocked roads and made bonfires. Passers-by made social media posts and videos reporting attacks on commuters, private vehicles and government-owned Bus Rapid Transport, BRT. Police Public Relations Officer, SP Benjamin Hundeyin provided an update in reaction to comments about the violence and apprehension by residents. “Free movement of vehicles and people fully restored. Our officers and men are still on ground to prevent any breakdown of law and order,” the spokesperson wrote. The unrest in parts of Lagos followed the scarcity of the new naira notes after the controversial redesign of the currency, only weeks to the general elections. Although President Muhammadu Buhari and the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, promised the massive injection of old N200 notes into the system, many still do not have access to their money. The situation is worsened by the closure of banks in different places, empty Automated Teller Machines, ATMs, and non-availability of cash at Points of Sale, PoS. A resident told DAILY POST that he would remain in Yaba while monitoring happenings on the Ikorodu road stretch and environs. “I just passed Ketu and Ojota, the places are calm for now (10:30am). Policemen and their vehicles are at locations including Jibowu, Maryland and Freedom Park,” he said. Despite the police and army deploying men to flashpoints across the state, other security agencies may join to keep the peace, in the event of violence spreads.
