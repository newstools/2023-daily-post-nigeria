Former Kaduna South Senator, Shehu Sani, said vote buyers have resorted to another method to buy votes ahead Saturday’s presidential and national assembly elections. According to him, those whose plan is to induce voters with money are now collecting the account details of prospective ‘vote sellers’. Sani’s comment is coming amidst the unavailability of cash occasioned by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) naira redesign policy. The activist had earlier accused some governors of stashing the old naira notes for the purpose of vote buying, saying they were caught on the hop by the CBN naira redesign which has now rendered their looted funds useless. Aside from sending money to voters online, Sani stated that the politicians have also started sharing what he called palliatives in exchange for votes. “Vote buyers have resorted to collecting the account numbers of the electorates. “There is also sharing palliatives in return for votes,” Sani said on Twitter.
