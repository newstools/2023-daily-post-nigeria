Arsenal legend, Paul Merson, has suggested that Chelsea will sack their manager Graham Potter if they lose against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. According to Merson, there ‘may not be a way back’ for Potter if Chelsea loses to rivals Tottenham on Sunday. He, however, reckons Chelsea hierarchy to give the Englishman, who is currently under intense pressure at Stamford Bridge, more time. Chelsea will face Tottenham in an away Premier League London derby this weekend after losing against Southampton in their last fixture. “He [Potter] has just been beaten at home by the bottom of the league and he is still there, so maybe they will stick by him,” Merson told Sky Sports. “This Sunday is Chelsea’s biggest game of the season – it’s Tottenham. If he loses this one, I am not sure there is a way back because the fans will go ballistic. “This game can change everything, though – if Chelsea beat Spurs, he can also be a hero. People think Potter isn’t the right man for the job, but I think he is. For me, I think [They should] give him time.” He added, “I like him as a manager, but I look at the quality of the players and I question it.”
