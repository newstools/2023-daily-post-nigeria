Uju Kingsley Chima, a member of the House of Representatives, has reacted to the sit-at-home order by Simon Ekpa’s faction of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. Recall that the outlawed separatist group had threatened to issue a sit-at-home order in the South East during Saturday’s general elections. Speaking on Arise TV on Thursday afternoon, Chima rubbished the sit-at-home order by Ekpa, insisting that over 3, 000 people came out for rallies in the South East ahead of this weekend’s general election. Chima said: “The question we are asking today is who are the persons declaring these [orders]. I told you about an incident yesterday where policemen were claiming to be unknown gunmen at one of the rallies. They even said to them “we are unknown gunmen” and that people should go.” He further said: “A greater percentage of what is happening in the South East are not done by the agitators. I don’t know who they are, but I am just telling you that a bigger percentage is done by desperation, desperation to win an election. How can a policeman wear a mask, I ask you this question, is it right for a policeman to wear a mask on election day to go to a rallying point and disperse people with teargas? “He is not meant to wear a mask, pretending or hiding under cover of the unknown gunmen to protect their act, this is the major problem we are having in the South East.” Meanwhile, Ekpa, who declared that there would be no election in the Southeast, was reportedly arrested by the Finland authority on Thursday.
