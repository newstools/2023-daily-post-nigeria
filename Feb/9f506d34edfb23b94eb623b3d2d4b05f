Former Manchester United attacker, Louis Saha, has named the two best players in the world at the moment. According to Saha, Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappe and Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford are the two best players in the world currently. He said Mbappe is unplayable, while Rashford is being transferred the energy of Cristiano Ronaldo. Both Mbappe and Rashford have been impressive for their respective clubs so far this season. Mbappe has scored 15 goals for PSG this term, while Rashford has netted 16 goals. “There are not many better than Rashford at the moment in world football, but Kylian Mbappe is still the best as he has been incredible over the last three years and the boss at PSG, even with Neymar and Lionel Messi there,” Saha told Lord Ping. “In terms of how good he was in the World Cup too, but Mbappe and Rashford are the best two in the world at the moment.” He added, “Erling Haaland is playing well, but he does not provide as much. The excitement, speed, and confidence of this guy at the moment, he is unplayable and Kylian Mbappe is the same – it is impossible to defend these skilful players.” “It seems he has been transferred the energy of Cristiano Ronaldo since his departure – I don’t know what’s happened to the kid!”
