A group under the umbrella of the International Christian Ministers Association of Nigeria, Taraba State chapter, on Tuesday, distanced itself from the purported endorsement of a particular governorship candidate in the state by the leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN. The alleged endorsement of a gubernatorial candidate by CAN has been trending on various social media platforms. Making the position of the association known to newsmen in Jalingo, the state capital, the leader of the group, Bishop Silas Usman Loto, said they are not a party to the purported endorsement of any candidate for next week’s governorship election in the state. Stressing that the governorship candidates of the All Progressives Congress, APC, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and the Social Democratic Party, SDP, are Christians, the group sees no reason why it should throw its weight behind any of the candidates. The association, regarded the endorsement of “a specific candidate” to be “wrong” and wondered why the leadership of CAN in the state continues to dabble in politics. According to Bishop Loto: “CAN should leave people to choose for themselves who should lead them. It should not impose its opinion on anybody.” He cited how CAN “succeeded in creating problems for the people in 2015 and 2019 by using the association to canvas for support for the present administration.” Trying to indulge in such an act again, the group believed, would be inimical to the growth of the state. CAN in Taraba recently announced the endorsement of the governorship candidate of the PDP, an action that is raising dust among the Christian community in the state.
