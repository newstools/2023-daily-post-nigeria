President Muhammadu Buhari had on Thursday, asked the Central Bank of Nigeria to make available the old two hundred naira note, extending its usage till April 10, 2023. The decision by the president has, however, been criticized by some governors of the All Progressives Congress, including Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, who faulted President Muhammadu Buhariâ€™s directive limiting the legal tender status of old notes to only N200, describing it as a total disregard of the Supreme Court on the matter.
