Former Manchester United striker Michael Owen has revealed why Leicester City were defeated by Manchester United in their Premier League clash on Sunday. Manchester United beat Leicester City 3-0 at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon with goals from Marcus Rashford (2) and Jadon Sancho, sealing all three points for the Red Devils. Leicester City dominated the first half of the encounter but missed several golden opportunities to take the lead with Kelechi Iheanacho forcing a huge save from David De Gea. Brendan Rodgers’ side had the opportunity to go at least two goals up in the first half but failed to capitalise on them and Owen blamed Iheanacho and his teammates for their defeat. “Leicester have been great,” he told Premier League Productions. “They have so many chances, so many breakaway, so many times when they’ve had the chance to open the Manchester United defence but were not able to capitalise on them.”
