A social commentator, Deji Adeyanju, has said supporters of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, would allege the 2023 election was rigged after losing. Eligible Nigerians will go out to choose a new president on February 25, 2023. The four leading candidates in the poll are Obi; Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). But, Adeyanju had predicted that Obi would come third in the election. According to him, the former Anambra governor and his followers had refused to build structures across the nation. Adeyanju stated that the Obidients were rather on the social media insulting people and organising polls online. “The funniest thing we will see on social media this month is when Obi comes distant 3rd, his supporters will scream rigging. “The time they should have used to build structures round the country, they spent it insulting us and organizing online polls,” he posted on his Facebook page.
