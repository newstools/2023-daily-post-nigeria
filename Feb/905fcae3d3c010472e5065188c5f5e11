The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi, has arrived at the venue of the National Economic Summit Group in Lagos for its Dialogue with Presidential Candidates. Obi disclosed this in a post via his verified Twitter handle on Monday. Recall that the duo of the presidential candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and the All Progressives Congress, APC, Atiku Abubakar and Bola Tinubu, had featured at the program in January. Atiku and Tinubu used the opportunity to present their economic blueprints for the country. Obi would take his turn to present his economic policy plans for the country. “I just arrived at the venue for the NESG Dialogue with Presidential Candidates on the Nigerian Economy in Lagos,” Obi tweeted. Nigerian Economic Summit Group, NESG, was established and incorporated as a non-profit, non-partisan private sector organisation with a mandate to promote and champion the reform of the Nigerian economy into an open, private sector-led, globally competitive economy.
