The Federal Government, in collaboration with International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS), has repatriated 150 stranded Nigerians from (Niamey) Niger Republic. Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar-Farouq, disclosed this while receiving the returnees at the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport in Kano on Monday. Umar-Farouq, represented by Director of Humanitarian Affairs in the Ministry, Grema Ali, said the returnees arrived at the airport at about 3:45 p.m. The returnees were transported into Nigeria by the SKY MALI Airlines, operated by Ethiopian aviation industry.
According to her, the returnees were repatriated to Nigeria through a voluntary programme. “The programme was meant for the distressed Nigerians who had left the country to search for greener pastures across European countries and Africa but could not afford to return when their journey became frustrated,” he said. The returnees comprised 125 males,14 females and 11 children. “The returnees are from different parts of Nigeria especially Yobe, Kaduna, Bauchi, Sokoto, Katsina and Kano states, among others,” she said. She explained that the returnees would undergo a three-day training on how to achieve self sustainability and would be provided with seed capital to enable them engage in productive ventures to be self reliant. She advised the general public to avoid endangering their lives by travelling to seek for greener pastures in other countries, adding that no country was better than their country of origin.
