Arsenal legend, Paul Merson, has predicted Wednesday’s Premier League clash between his former side and Manchester City. The Gunners dropped more points against Brentford after they were held to a 1-1 draw at the Emirates. Ivan Toney headed in from close range to cancel out Leandro Trossard’s opening goal. Mikel Arteta’s men are now six points ahead of City, who welcome Aston Villa on Sunday. If the champions win that game, they will arrive in London only three points behind Arsenal. Merson has described it as a “make or break” encounter. He told Sky Sports: “It’s a massive football match on Wednesday. I think it’s a make-or-break. If Man City goes and wins the game, I don’t see Arsenal coming back from that. “After today’s performance, I don’t see them beating Man City on Wednesday. I’d be quite shocked. They were so open at the back. Played 2v2 at the back. If Brentford had picked the right pass at times they’d have got in and won that game.”
