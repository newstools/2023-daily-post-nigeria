The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), has warned the over 200,000 corps members deployed to serve as ad hoc workers in the 2023 general election against collecting any form of gratification from politicians. Director General, Brigadier General Yushau Dogara Ahmed, while addressing reporters at the scheme’s headquarters in Abuja on Tuesday, warned of severe punishment for any corps member caught going against the law. To ensure the security of members of the scheme participating for the election, the NYSC also unveiled a 24 hours 6972 distress call centre for the election period at the headquarters. According to Ahmed, corps members participating in the general elections have been properly trained on election matters by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC and are ready to carry out their respective duties. He said that nothing short of professionalism is expected of the corps members as they are expected to abide not only by the rules of the NYSC, but also by guiding rules and regulations established by INEC. Ahmed said the scheme has met with security agencies, who in turn promised to provide adequate security for the corps members wherever they are posted to carry out this assignment. He also said that vehicles will be made available by INEC to corps members to their respective place of assignment, and bring them back safely and also cater for their welfare. “We do not expect corps members to accept any form of gratification, all we are asking them to do is to do their duties as expected of them and leave,” he warned. “And whenever they leave the place of their duties they should be within their lodges because as part of our discussion with the Inspector General of Police and the DSS these places will be taken into consideration in terms of security.”
