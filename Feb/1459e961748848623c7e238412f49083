Yaya, evicted Big Brother Titans housemate, has predicted the likely winner of the reality show. Yaya, who was evicted during the live show on Sunday, said that Olivia would emerge the winner of the $100,000. According to her, Olivia is playing the game and is lovable. “I think Olivia would win. She is smart and playing the game very well. “She is a smooth operator and is very lovable. Ebubu might be in the finals because no one nominated him,” she said.
