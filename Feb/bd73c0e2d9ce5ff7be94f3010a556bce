Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola will not stop lambasting rival clubs who he believes are jealous of his side’s achievements in the past years and want them kicked out of the Premier league. The Spaniard is accusing clubs in the English top flight of jealousy in pushing for the Cityzenes to be punished for breaching financial regulations. The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss said the other 19 Premier League clubs are behind the over 100 charges they were slammed with last week for breaking the competition’s Financial Fair Play rules. The bulk of the new Premier League charges cover a period from 2009-18. The Cityzenes are currently being investigated and could be slammed with points deductions, transfer embargoes, being stripped of titles or even expulsion from the competition. The Catalan said: “Come on, they[the titles] belong to us. Absolutely, they belong to us. Regardless of the sentence, they belong to us. “The moment from Sergio Aguero, with Balotelli slipping him in… I don’t know if we are responsible for Steven Gerrard slipping. In that situation at Anfield I didn’t want that, for respect for Steven Gerrard, but is it our fault? Come on. That belongs to us…”
