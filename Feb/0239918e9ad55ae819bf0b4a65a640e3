The National Christian Pilgrims Commission (NCPC) will on Tuesday, February 7, conduct the final screening of Christians from Adamawa State to perform pilgrimage to Israel and Jordan. The 150, who comprise people in the grassroots, at least, five from each of the 21 local government areas of the state as well as officials, have been okayed at the state level for the exercise but NCPC officials are to do the final screening for the pilgrims to be fully set. This was disclosed by the Executive Secretary of the Adamawa State Christian Pilgrim Welfare Board, Rev Love Zidon, who added that the NCPC would after their screening, fix a date for the Adamawa pilgrims to leave for the holy lands. Rev Zidon Love, addressing a news briefing at his office in Yola, said, “We have done the documentation at our level. The NCPC will be here on Tuesday, February 7, 2023 to ensure that all documents are as required.” He said the selection for the current pilgrimage was done in a manner to include not only highly placed individuals but people from the grassroots. “We’ve done everything to ensure that Adamawa people participate in the current pilgrimage by Nigerians to the Holy lands. “The government has arranged for almost 150 to go, but not in the usual manner. The state government directed that the pilgrims should come from the grassroots. The local government chairmen are generating the list of people to go,” Love Zidon said.
