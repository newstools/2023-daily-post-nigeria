The Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC, Dr Ahmed Abubakar Audi, on Sunday commended officers and men of the corps for their impressive performances and professional conduct during the first phase of the 2023 general election. CC Olusola Odumusu, Director of Public Relations at NSCDC national headquarters in Abuja, in a statement, noted: “[From] the reports obtained across the country, personnel of the corps gave good accounts of themselves in the various polling stations they were deployed to in the 774 local government areas of the country without undue interference and compromise.” Audi further charged officers and men of the corps to continue to display excellent performance, resilience, doggedness and commitment to the second phase, which is the governorship and state assembly elections. He also commended the unprecedented synergy and cooperation on display among the various security agencies during the elections, stating that, it is a demonstration that with proper coordination and good understanding of one another, security agencies in the country have the capability to surmount any security challenges confronting the nation. He described the corps’ outing during elections as highly remarkable and commended the deployment of security agencies with the Nigeria police as the lead agency on election matters which ensured a smooth process. He appreciated the real-time responses of personnel to emergency situations in supporting the police to achieve peace and orderliness, especially in areas where there are reports of attacks by hoodlums on polling units. Dr Audi commended INEC for the successful conduct of the election and expressed confidence that the delay in the arrival of INEC officials and materials as complained in some polling units is something that would be improved upon in the second phase of the election scheduled to hold on 11th March 2023.
