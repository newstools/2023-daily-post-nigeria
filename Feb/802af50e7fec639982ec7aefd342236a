The 1,500 primary and secondary school teachers in Osun State recruited by the immediate past administration of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola have once again pleaded with Governor Ademola Adeleke to rescind his executive order that nullified their appointment, noting that failure to do so would push them back into unemployment. The affected teachers while addressing journalists in Osogbo on Monday also added that their employment by the former administration followed due process. The sacked teachers who resumed work under the administration of Adegboyega Oyetola were yet to be paid their salaries. DAILY POST recalls that earlier in January 2023, the teachers had urged the Adeleke administration to look into their plight and pay their salaries, pleading that four of their colleagues had died of depression. Speaking on behalf of her colleagues, Isola Eunice pleaded with the governor to have mercy on them by addressing them and letting them know their fate on the teaching job. “We have done everything possible to get his (Governor Adeleke’s) attention but we have not been able to get his response. We are dying of depression because a great number of us had resigned from our former places of employment,” she stated. Another of the affected teachers, Adedeji Emmanuel argued that their recruitment which started in 2020 followed due procedure before they all got their appointment letters on September 30, 2022. Emmanuel, who lamented that most of them graduated some 10 to 15 years ago, added that it will not be palatable for the government to force them back into the street as jobless individuals.
