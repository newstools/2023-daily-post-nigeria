The South East Zonal Secretariat of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) on Thursday, said the purported suspension of the Governorship candidate of the party in Abia State, Bishop Sunday Onuoha and three other ADC candidates for the 2023 National Assembly elections by one Norman Obinna is fake news. The opposition party stated this in a statement signed by the National Vice Chairman, South East, Chilos Godsent, made available to DAILY POST in Owerri, Imo State. The party said the South East Zonal Secretariat of the ADC read with utmost disappointment the fake news being circulated by one Norman Obinna claiming to be the Chairman of ADC Abia State and purporting to have suspended the ADC Governorship candidate for Abia State, Bishop Sunday Onuoha. The statement reads: “Consequent upon the above, we therefore urge the good people of Abia State to disregard this fake news from Norman Obinna which was targeted to malign the good image of our candidates and the Party at large in order to get material rewards in return from their pay masters. “We wish to inform the general public that the said Norman Obinna has been expelled from the African Democratic Congress (ADC) since September 2022 for offences bordering on misappropriation, leadership ineptitude and anti-party activities to mention but few. “Thus, the said Norman Obinna is not a member of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) and is not the Chairman of ADC in Abia State. “The South East Zonal Secretariat of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) strongly suspects that the said Norman Obinna was hired by opposition political parties to cause confusion in the ADC family in Abia State and to the minds of the Abia State electorates by circulating such fake news. “We are strongly aware that many political parties in Abia State are very scared of the rapidly growing popularity of Bishop Sunday Onuoha and the African Democratic Congress (ADC) in Abia State in the recent time, coupled with the crises in the other political parties in Abia State. “The good people of Abia State cannot sit and fold their hands and helplessly watch the enemies of Abians to trade off with the destiny of over six million Abia State residents.”
