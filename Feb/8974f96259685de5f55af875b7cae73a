A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Adamu Garba has accused some presidential candidates of playing regional cards ahead of the forthcoming general elections. Garba accused the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar of playing the Northern card, while his counterpart from the New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, Rabiu Kwankwaso is playing the Northwest card. He also accused the Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate, Peter Obi of playing the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, agenda. In a series of tweets, Adamu, however, said the APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu was playing the national card. He wrote: “Atiku is playing the Northern card, Kwankwaso is playing the North West card, Peter Obi is playing the IPOB agenda card. “But Tinubu is playing the national card. Tinubu is the only Presidential candidate with a national spread. You only win the Nigerian Presidency with a national card. “If regional hegemony can win the Presidential election, Buhari would have been the President since 2003. God bless our forefathers for a nationalist constitution that encourages spread. “It is, therefore, very clear, that Bola Tinubu is the next President of Nigeria. Vote for APC. “As a nationalist, I’ll only go with a nationalist candidate of a national party, the APC. I’ll definitely Vote for APC.”
