The Department of State Services (DSS) has said its interrogation of a former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, is not over. The DSS invited Fani-Kayode on Monday over a post he made on his Twitter account over the weekend. In the tweets, the former Minister alleged that some top military officers met with the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar and were plotting to carry out a coup. Despite a five-hour grilling of Fani-Kayode, the DSS has now said the interrogation is not closed. The agency also issued a warning to political parties to apply restraint in their comments ahead of the elections. â€œChief Fani-Kayode faced a panel which interviewed him on the subject matter. Afterwards, the Service granted him administrative bail and directed that he make routine returns to the Office with effect from Wednesday, 15th February, 2023 till otherwise. The investigation, however, continues.
