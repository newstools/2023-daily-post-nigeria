Protests on Wednesday rocked the Udu road area of Delta State, resulting in the death of two persons and the burning of two commercial banks over naira scarcity. DAILY POST gathered that protesters went on a rampage destroying and vandalising First, Access and Union commercial banks’ assets at the Express Junction, Udu road, Delta State. In a chat with DAILY POST, Mrs Bredjor Okoro, an eyewitness, said two persons had been killed and several others injured due to the protest. She informed DAILY POST that angry protesters had burned down three banks. “Everywhere is on fire; First, Union and Access Banks buildings were burnt down by protesters over the naira crisis. At the moment, two people have been killed from trail bullets by Police officers deployed to contain the situation”, she stated. However, when DAILY POST contacted the Delta State Police Command Public Relations Officer, Mr Bright Edafe, he denied claims that two people were killed during the protest. “Yes, there was a protest in the Udu road area of Delta State. Our men were deployed immediately, and normalcy is returning to the place. He added, “two commercial banks, Access and Union Banks, were burnt down and two Corolla Vehicles were burnt down”.
