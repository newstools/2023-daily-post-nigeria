Real Madrid legend, Sergio Ramos is determined to secure UEFA Champions League glory with the Parisians, insisting that the best team doesn’t always win. Ramos has established himself as a key part of PSG’s squad since the start of 2023 after recovering from a string of injuries. The Spaniard completed 90 minutes in PSG’s Champions League round of 16 first leg 1-0 defeat to Bayern Munich, and they face a fight to stay in the tournament next month when the Bundesliga champions host Christophe Galtier’s side in the return leg. “I’m where I want to be and at a club with a desire to win the Champions League. “I want to make the most of what is left of my playing career. “Beating Bayern would send a very positive message. To win the Champions League, you’ve to beat the best and Bayern are among them each year. However, the best teams don’t always win,” Romas said, as quoted by Diario AS.
