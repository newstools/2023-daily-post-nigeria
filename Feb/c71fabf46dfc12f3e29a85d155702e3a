Al-Nassr star, Jaloliddin Masharipov, has revealed how the rest of the players feel about Cristiano Ronaldo being named the club’s captain immediately after his arrival at the club. Ronaldo joined Al-Nassr last December after his contract with Manchester United was terminated by mutual consent. The Portugal captain signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with the Saudi Pro League club and was also made the club’s new captain, replacing Abdullah Madu. Speaking with Sports.ru, Masharipov suggested that Al-Nassr players expected Ronaldo would captain the team, adding that it was the best solution. He said, “It’d be a little strange if the rest of the players are captaining Ronaldo. “We expected it. Our former captain willingly handed over the armband [to Ronaldo] without any problems. I think this is the best solution. It cannot be otherwise.”
