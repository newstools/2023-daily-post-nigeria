Governor Umar Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has come hard on President Muhammadu Buhari for refusing to abide by the Supreme Court order and going ahead with the ban on the old Naira notes. In an audio recording, Ganduje was quoted in vernacular asking, that, “President Buhari should remember that for several times he was trying to contest Presidency but he couldn’t make it until there was an alliance, but now after enjoying everything, he turned back against the same democratic system that saw him to office”. He said, “the President should remember that this is a democratic setting that allows popular voice and leaders to listen to advice and adhere strictly to those advice. “I wonder why the President is hellbent in making the same Party that helped him to win elections lose out, what did we do to him that he is this ignorant on several advice forwarded to him”. “This same Buhari he contested again and again but he couldn’t win not until there was an alliance, now he wins and win again for the second term, but now that he is living, he wants to cripple the same Party that brought him to power why? “This Currency Swap Policy, why didn’t the President bring it seven and a half years ago or after elections, but now one must be compelled to think that there is an ulterior motive in the whole thing.” Ganduje, who somehow exonerated the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, said, “the CBN Governor don’t know anything; you now set the Nation Apex Bank on fire with this policy”. The Governor worried that even World Bank, IMF and other financial Institutions have advised the President to think twice on the negative policy but he turned deaf ears.
