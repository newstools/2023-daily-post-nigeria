A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Femi Fani-Kayode, has said it would be dangerous to hand over power to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Fani-Kayode also said that the party is led by shady and unreliable people who are only interested in scamming the Nigerian state and plundering its resources. His statement is contained in a post via his verified Twitter handle on Tuesday. The former Minister of Aviation insisted that the PDP has a thieving spirit and no fear of God, claiming it would be disastrous to let them into power. He wrote, “The PDP are a coven of shape-shifting reptilians, blood-sucking demons, end-time reprobates, bum-sucking perverts, unrepentant gangsters, self-serving carpetbaggers, incorrigible rogues & thieving spirits who have no fear of God. “They are a congress of violent psychopaths, sociopathic monsters, mendacious malcontents, malicious malevolents, primitive fraudsters, troubled losers & dark & frustrated souls whose motto & battle cry is ‘SHARE THE MONEY’. They are the missing link: half ape and half man. “They are the Nephilim: the products and offspring of an unholy union and godless copulation between fallen angels and the daughters of men. “Worse still, they are led by a shady, unreliable, duplicitous, ruthless, treacherous, self-obsessed, vicious, parasitic, desperate, drug-dealing, non-binary & sexually-conflicted boy-lover who has spent his life living off & scamming the Nig. state & plundering our resources. “The most dangerous thing that we can do is to hand over Nigeria to such people.”
