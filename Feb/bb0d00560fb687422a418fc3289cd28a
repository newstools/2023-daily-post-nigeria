Barely two weeks to the presidential election, a Director of the Labour Party, LP, presidential campaign council in Bauchi State, Alhassan Bawu has dumped the party. Bawu defected to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Explaining his decision, Bawu said he defected to the PDP to support the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. Speaking with journalists on Tuesday in Bauchi, he said the entire LP leaders in the Northeast had joined the PDP. He disclosed that the defectors believed Atiku had the capacity to lead Nigeria. Bawu said the LP lacked structure at ward, local and State levels, hence their decision to defect to PDP. He said: “We believe the LP is not strong enough to win a single seat in the North-East. “We are officially declaring that all the North-East executives of Labour Party are defecting to PDP to support Atiku. “We don’t want to waste our votes, and we want to use this time to mobilise votes to who has the capacity to win the election.”
