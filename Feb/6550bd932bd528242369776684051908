Arsenal legend Martin Keown has blamed the team’s goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale for their Premier League 1-1 draw with Brentford on Saturday, Mikel Arteta’s side dropped two more points on Saturday having suffered a shocking defeat to Everton the previous weekend. They were held to a 1-1 draw at the Emirates by Thomas Frank’s men after Leandro Trossard put them ahead in the 66th minute of the match. Brentford’s striker, Ivan Toney scored a controversial equalizer soon after and Ramsdale’s role in Toney’s goal was questionable. The England goalkeeper was drawn off his line, leaving the striker with an empty net to tap into and Keown feels he is responsible for his side dropping more points and missing the opportunity to extend their lead to eight points. “Credit to Brentford. Many looked at VAR, it looked to me like it was offside but in the end, they did give it,” Keown told BBC. “Ramsdale in the build-up was drawn away out of the box and he came rushing out. Empty goal and it was a tap-in for Toney.”
