The Labour Party has asked all its agents nationwide to submit the actual results from their polling units in the February 25, 2023, presidential election. This could be in preparation for a legal battle after the declaration of presidential election results by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, in a few hours. The presidential election was keenly contested between the Labour Party, the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. However, there have been reports of massive rigging and manipulation of the process by some state governors, especially in Rivers and Lagos states. The Labour Party agent, Umaru Ibrahim Farouk, stormed out of the National Collation Centre of INEC on Monday, alleging that the system had been compromised. In a tweet via its official Twitter handle, the LP said, “All Labour Party agents are by this notice asked to send the actual results of Form EC8A and EC8B especially those from Lagos and Rivers states ie the captured image results at the polling units and ward levels to this WhatsApp number; 08106679860. It is urgent!.”
