The Coalition of South East Youth Leaders, COSEYL has lauded the chairman of Ohanaeze Elders Council Worldwide, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu for planning to convey a peace summit ahead of the Saturday election. In a statement issued on Monday by the President General of the coalition, Goodluck Ibem, COSEYL commended the efforts of Ohanaeze Ndigbo to secure the release of the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu from the custody of the Department of State Serves, DSS. The coalition observed that the move for a peace summit in the region is timely noting that insecurity has taken over “our land.” Ibem stated: “Ndigbo is known for peace, togetherness and industrialization and that trait is gradually eluding us as a people. “We commend the great move by Ohanaeze Ndigbo Elders Council, ably led by Chief Iwuanyanwu and we urge all and sundry to lend their support to this all-important peace move. “South East governors should try and leave electioneering and press on President Muhammadu Buhari to release Nnamdi Kanu unconditionally as ordered by the Federal Court of Appeal.” Ohanaeze conceived the plan to hold a peace summit in the Southeast to sue for peace and calm over a plot by some secessionists to stop elections in the region.
