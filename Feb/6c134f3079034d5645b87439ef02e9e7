A legal practitioner, Wale Aderibigbe has advocated for patience on the prospect of e-voting in Nigeria, saying the country still has to improve on its general information and communication technology framework to get the process right. Aderibigbe who said there are still a lot of teething problems associated with Nigeria’s internet facilities added that the situation will hamper the smooth process of e-voting if the nation decided to adopt it at this moment. He stated this on Saturday after casting his vote at Okua in the Odo-Otin local government area of Osun State. The legal luminary who agreed that Nigeria should consider those in the diaspora and deploy e-voting admonished the federal government to improve the nation’s ICT framework in preparation for future elections. “I commend the federal government through the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on the introduction of the BVAS machine. The introduction of e-voting in elections should be taken gradually. “The BIVAS technology has no doubt improved the nation’s election process and reduce issues of malpractice usually associated with the election process in the country. “I must say that we still have a lot to improve upon in our electioneering process, especially in the area of e-voting, but we have to take it one at a time and gradually. “As regards the e-voting as being clamoured for in some quarters so as to take care of Nigerians in the diaspora we have to take it steadily, we must improve in our ICT framework so that it won’t be an effort in futility.”
