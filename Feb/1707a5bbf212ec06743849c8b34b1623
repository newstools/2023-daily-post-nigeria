Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has explained why they lost 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Harry Kane’s first-half finish was enough for the hosts to claim all three points. It was the 100th defeat of Guardiola’s managerial career, with his team failing to score at the Tottenham Stadium again. The result also means City don’t close the five-point gap between them and leaders Arsenal. “We started really well, as usually happens against Tottenham home and away, but after we made a mistake they punished us – 1-0 down it is different. “We had chances, and of course when we lose balls in transition with Kulusevski and Son, it is not easy. We dropped three points.” When asked if City players followed his plan, Guardiola replied: “Most of the time, yeah, But it is not easy when 10 players defend, and sit back a little bit more than in the Etihad two weeks ago. “We played good, started well and missed maybe the last pass, to shoot.”
