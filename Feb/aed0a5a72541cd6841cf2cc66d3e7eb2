The wrangling surrounding the possibility of the Taraba State chapter of the All Progressive Congress, APC, fielding a governorship candidate in the forthcoming general elections has finally been laid to rest. The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, added the name of Emmanuel Bwacha, the party’s candidate, to its portal on Tuesday. Following the recent Supreme Court judgment and the circumstances surrounding the rerun governorship primary of the party, it was rumoured all over the state that the party wouldn’t field a guber candidate. Announcing the development via a press statement, the party’s Spokesperson, Aaron Artimas, said “It has become highly important to reassure all members of the APC and teeming supporters that Senator Emmanuel Bwacha remains the authentic and undisputed gubernatorial candidate of the APC in Taraba State.” His name, as stated in the statement, “has been added to the INEC portal as Taraba’s APC governorship candidate in Taraba State.” He added that “We are not unaware that the rumour surrounding Senator Bwacha’s candidature is deliberately spread by desperate opposition elements to hoodwink, distract, and discourage our supporters from remaining focused on our campaign.” He said the APC had organised its re-run guber primary in the state, which was duly supervised by the state INEC commissioner and his staff on the directives of the commission. He said the National Working Committee of the party had submitted Bwacha’s name to the commission and uploaded it to its portal. While appealing to “all responsible people of the state to discount such wild rumours and deliberate falsehood against the APC and its highly respected gubernatorial candidate” the APC members and supporters, he said “are to note that the party will start its state-wide campaign in a few days.” This, as emphasised by him, is geared towards “installing an APC regime in the state.”
