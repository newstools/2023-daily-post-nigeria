Dele Momodu, a spokesperson of the Peoples Democratic Party Presidential Campaign Council, has countered Professor Pat Utomi, the Convener of BIG-TENT, a coalition of Political Parties, Social Movements and Civil Society Organisations for Peter Obi-Baba-Ahmed Datti, over his recent comments on the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Utomi had on Thursday morning insisted that Tinubu is ‘not physically and mentally fit to rule Nigeria.’ He made the claims while fielding questions on Arise Television’s Morning Show programme. However, when asked by the same medium to react to Utomi’s statement on Tinubu, Momodu said what the professor said made no sense. Momodu, however, admitted he is not a medical doctor or a psychiatrist to speak on the mental ability or capacity of Tinubu, adding that Nigerians should be the judge. The veteran journalist said, “I am not a medical doctor, I am not a psychiatrist, so I cannot speak to the mental ability or capacity of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and then also in the mood of the peace accord I am not supposed to have any bad words for anybody today. “I want to be remembered as one of the few people who ran a professional campaign, so let Nigerians themselves judge whether they think Tinubu is physically fit, mentally ok, let Nigerians be the judge. “I don’t want anybody to say it is Dele Momodu who said this, who said that. Nigerians have eyes. Nigerians have ears. They can see how unruly these APC characters have been, extremely unruly, abusing their own president. “I saw my big brother Adams Oshiomole climbing the roof of a vehicle in Edo State and abusing Buhari. I had never seen this Fuji house of commotion in politics before, where people, who used to worship the president just because they knew he is on his way out and the man who wanted to take power from him is the one who is leading this rebellion. “So I am not a doctor, but what they are doing to him doesn’t make sense.”
