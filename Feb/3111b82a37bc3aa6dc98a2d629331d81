The English Premier League’s best dribblers have been revealed. Manchester City playmaker Kevin de Bruyne currently tops the list of the best dribblers in the Premier League. According to data gurus, CIES Football Observatory, De Bruyne is ahead of the likes of teammate Phil Foden and Liverpool’s Cody Gakpo. Opta defines a dribble – also known as a take-on – as “an attempt by a player to beat an opponent when they have possession of the ball”, with a successful dribble seeing them keep hold of it. Barcelona star Ousmane Dembele pips Real Madrid’s Vinicius Junior to be crowned overall take-on king in the world. But third on the list, and the top Premier League player, is De Bruyne. De Bruyne gets a 98.4 rating from CIES, which places him above the likes of Rafael Leao, Kingsley Coman and Kylian Mbappe. Here are Premier League’s top ten best dribblers: 1. Kevin de Bruyne
