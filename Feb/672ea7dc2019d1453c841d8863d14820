The issues of tribe and religion have been expunged from the questionnaire to be administered by the National Population Commission, NPC, in the 2023 head count in Nigeria. The Federal NPC Commissioner for Kwara state, Abdulrazaq Folorunsho Gidado, disclosed this in Ilorin on Wednesday while monitoring the ongoing training programme of functionaries who will conduct the exercise billed to hold between March 29-April 2, 2023. He said the housing and population census was crucial for sound development plans of the country which would be based on accurate data. According to him, for the government to plan for provision of infrastructure for the people generally, accurate, reliable and acceptable demographic data is fundamental which could only be obtained from the census exercise. Razaq Gidado charged the functionaries to take the census project seriously and make Kwara state proud. He said “I am satisfied and excited by the quality of the people recruited for the training programme and I can be rest assured that you will give Kwara state the desired result.”
