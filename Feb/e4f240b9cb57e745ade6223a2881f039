The Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Mahmood Yakubu, on Wednesday, revealed those who will attend the Commission’s daily media briefing for the 2023 general elections update. Yakubu also reassured of the Commission’s neutrality, insisting that INEC is not a political party and has no candidates in the election. He stated this as all political parties converged at the International Conference Centre, ICC, in Abuja for the signing of the second peace accord. Yakubu said: “I hereby reassured of the Commission’s neutrality. INEC is not a political party, we have no candidates in the election. Our allegiance is to the Federal Republic of Nigeria and our loyalty is to Nigerians. “Nigerians should feel confident that their votes will count. Over the next two days beginning from Thursday, the Commission will be holding a daily media briefing at 3 pm. “This briefing will be held at this venue. The purpose is to provide an update on the election and to respond to issues that will arise. “The briefing is open to political parties, Civil Society Organizations, observers, the media and security agencies. Once again, the Commission appreciates the work of the National Peace Committee and we urged the political party and candidate to abide by the letter of the accord. I look forward to meeting eligible voters at the polling units on Election Day.” DAILY POST reports that the peace accord was organised by the National Peace Committee headed by former Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar and Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah. APC’s Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Tinubu, PDP’s Atiku Abubakar, and Omoyele Sowore of Africa Action Congress (AAC), among others, were present at the event.
