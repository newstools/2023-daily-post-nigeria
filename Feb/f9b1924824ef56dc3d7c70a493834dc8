Chelsea forward, Joao Felix has predicted the Blues to win the UEFA Champions League trophy this season. Felix, who is currently on loan at Chelsea from Atletico Madrid, stated this following his side’s Premier League 1-1 draw with West Ham United over the weekend. Recall that Felix scored his first goal for Chelsea as they drew with West Ham United at the London Stadium. In a post-match interview with Chelsea media, Felix said: “We have to focus on the next game. The most important game is always the next. “It is the Champions League. That is the competition we want to win, so it starts on Wednesday, and it needs to be ours.” Chelsea are set to face Borussia Dortmund in the first leg of the Champions League round-of-16 on Wednesday.
