Manchester City defender, Kyle Walker, has warned Arsenal to expect “twists and turns” in the Premier League title race. City lost 1-0 at Tottenham on Sunday, thanks to Harry Kane’s first-half goal. It means the champions missed a crucial opportunity to cut Arsenal’s lead to two points, after the Gunners lost at Everton on Saturday. The Gunners remain five points clear of City with one game in hand. But Walker, speaking after today’s match, said: “Of course it is [a missed opportunity]. “They dropped points and we needed to pick up points to close the gap, but there is still a lot of football to be played. “I have been here many, many years in the Premier League and I know the twists and turns that can happen.”
