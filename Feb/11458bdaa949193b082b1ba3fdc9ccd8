A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Okumagba Ward in Warri, Delta State, Ogbolo Paul, has dumped the party and defected to the New Nigerian Peoples Party, NNPP, to work for its Delta South senatorial candidate, Commodore Omatseye Nesiama (retd). Paul who dumped the party during a town hall meeting organized by Nesiama for different political parties averred that he was swayed by a simple act of righteousness by Nesiama who kept his promise to give a woman who recently delivered a baby boy N20,000. Pleading his full allegiance to the NNPP candidate, he said: “I am a full APC member. Everyone here knows me as an APC leader in this community. [Becasue of] what I have heard today, I have moved to your side.” He added: “Today, I move to you because I see you as the choice of the people. As I am moving, I believe all my executives will work for you.”
