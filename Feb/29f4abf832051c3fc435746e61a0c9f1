One of the spokespersons for the All Progressives Congress, APC, Presidential Campaign Council, Bayo Onanuga, has accused the supporters of the Labour Party, LP, of causing massive traffic jams on the Lekki-Epe expressway. Onanuga also described it as an uncivilized way to campaign in Lagos State. He disclosed this in a post via his Twitter handle on Saturday. Recall that the Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate, Peter Obi, held campaign in Lagos on Saturday. The Tinubu, Shettima campaign spokesperson said that Obi chose to cause discomfort to Lagos residents. “Peter Obi and his supporters are doing a road walk in Lagos, causing massive traffic jam on the ever busy Lekki-Epe expressway. His rally is at TBS on the island. But he chose to cause discomfort to Lagosians. An uncivilized way to campaign in our city,” Onanuga tweeted.
