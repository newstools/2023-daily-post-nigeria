The Director General, Labour Party campaign council in Kaduna State, Tsahiru Bako has said the candidate, Jonathan Asake is the missing link that the state needs to ensure equity, fairness and justice in the state. He said the gubernatorial candidate has shown in all his endeavours that he is ready to ensure quality leadership that has eluded the state and brought it to the present challenge it is facing. He lamented that the present situation in the state is so pathetic that it requires an honest leader that would carry every citizen and resident in the state along to work as a formidable team for its unity, peace and progress. He said the attributes and determination to serve and create a new Nigeria by the Labour party’s presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi, is what the Kaduna governorship candidate is committed to doing in the state if elected. Briefing newsmen in Kaduna on Friday, Asake said the governorship campaign would commence its flag-off on Monday at Sabon gari, Zaria, Kaduna. He assured that the party would ensure proper enlightenment of the people to understand the manifesto of the party and what the people of the state stand to benefit. Bako commended the people of the state for the welcome accorded the LP presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi, in the state, especially at Kafanchan, the southern part of the state, saying, ”the world knows, that was an outing that was unprecedented and support the party enjoyed nationwide.” He said the party in the state has come up with a manifesto that is all incorporating, with a campaign structure to guide them as a party to have a road map that many other parties cannot come up with. Earlier, the Kaduna Labour Party, Chairman, Auwal Tafoki, applauded the massive support by the people during the presidential rally in the State and commended the show of acceptance to the Obi- Datti team, describing it as an ‘organic support’ while urging that it should be sustained to ensure the party’s victory during the elections.
