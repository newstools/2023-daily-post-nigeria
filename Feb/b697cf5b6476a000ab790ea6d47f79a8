The Premier League Match Day 25 kicked off Friday night with a 1-1 draw between Fulham and Wolves at Craven Cottage. On Saturday and Sunday, there will be more exciting games across England’s top flight. So which games are we likely to see upsets? 1. Leicester vs Arsenal: It was a whirlwind of a week for Arsenal last week, as they lost the top spot to Manchester City for a few days. But Mikel Arteta’s men pulled off a 4-2 win at Aston Villa to regain first place. On Saturday, the Gunners have another crucial away game at Leicester City. Forget their 3-0 thrashing at Manchester United, the Foxes can pull off a shock result in front of their fans. 2. Bournemouth vs Man City: Pep Guardiola’s men have not been very strong on the road this season. And just last weekend, they ended up drawing 1-1 at Nottingham Forest. Bournemouth have found some form in recent weeks and could provide another stern test for City, who are trying to keep up with Arsenal at the top of the Premier League. 3. Crystal Palace vs Liverpool: Earlier this week, Liverpool threw away a two-goal lead and lost 5-2 to Real Madrid in the Champions League. Jurgen Klopp’s men might show up at Selhurst Park with a bit of a hangover from that game. And if indeed they are not at their races, the Reds might not leave London with maximum points.
