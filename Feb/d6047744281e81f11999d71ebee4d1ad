The Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to Bola Tinubu, the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Abdulaziz Abdulaziz, has said his principal has always identified with the predicament faced by the North. His statement is contained in a post on the Twitter handle of the APC Presidential Campaign Council on Wednesday. Abdulaziz said Tinubu has shamed the naysayers who alleged he was sick through his effortless but very gruelling campaign. He also said Tinubu’s teeming voters are upbeat to deliver him during the forthcoming presidential election on Saturday. Part of the statement read: “Beyond the shores of politics, Tinubu has always identified with predicaments faced by the North. He also paid more than just lip service. Infact he acted much more than he spoke or showed up. ”As a permanent resident of Nigeria, he associates more closely with the happenings around the country and has always extended hands of fellowship or offered his metaphorically large shoulders to shoulder parts of the burden. He had been to places from Zamfara to Birnin Gwari to console victims of banditry and offer hope and aid.”
