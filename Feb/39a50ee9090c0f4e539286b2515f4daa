The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission, ICPC, says it has arrested a woman simply identified as Simisola for allegedly selling the redesigned Naira notes via social media. The ICPC spokesperson, Mrs Azuka Ogugua, who made this known in a statement on Wednesday, said the suspect with the Twitter handle @Simisola of Lala, is colluding with some elements in the financial system to divert the new notes. According to the spokesperson, the suspect was arrested as a result of intelligence received by operatives of the commission. She stated that the suspect was allegedly using the opportunity of the scarcity of the new naira notes to openly market the notes to Nigerians. “It is believed she is in collusion with key elements in the financial services sector diverting the newly released notes away from banking halls and payment channels into a ‘black market,'” she said. The entire nation is currently battling with scarcity of the redesigned Naira notes despite assurances from the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN.
