The Nigeria Police Force has ordered movement restriction for the first part of the 2023 General Elections – the Presidential and National Assembly Elections. The polls are scheduled to be held on Saturday February 25 across all 36 States and the Federal Capital Territory, FCT. The Force headquarters, Wednesday night, announced that the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba ordered no movement on roads, waterways, and other forms of transportation, from 12am to 6pm on election day. A statement by Force Public Relations Officer, CSP Muyiwa Adejobi said those on essential services such as Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, officials, observers, ambulances, firefighters, etc. are exempted. The spokesperson noted that the directive is part of measures emplaced to ensure a safe, secure, and conducive environment for the conduct of the polls. The police said security agencies were collaborating to prevent hoodlums and criminally-minded elements from disrupting the electoral process. The IGP warned security aides and escorts against accompanying their principals and politicians to polling booths and collation centres. “Anyone found flouting this directive will be severely sanctioned. Only security personnel assigned to election duties are to be seen within and around the designated election booths and centres,” the statement reads. Adejobi said the ban on use of sirens, revolving lights, covered number plates, and tinted glasses is still in force, adding that violators would be sanctioned appropriately. The police further ordered all state-established security outfits/organizations, quasi-security units, and privately-owned guards to stay away from the national exercise. The statement urged the general public to contact the Joint Election Monitoring and Operations Room and use the Rescue Me Emergency Toll-free line 08031230631 to report emergencies.
