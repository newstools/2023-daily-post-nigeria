Ahead of the February and March general elections, the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC has revealed actions it would take if the Bimodal Voter Registration Systems, BVAS is snatched by thugs on election day. The Commission’s Deputy Director of Information and Communications Technology, Lawrence Bayode said on Wednesday that the electoral body has a system meant to deactivate any BVAS that is snatched. Bayode who spoke on Channels Television’s special election programme noted that “if a BVAS is snatched, we already have a system in place that can deactivate that particular BVAS. The (hoodlums) cannot take over the accreditation process because the device is designed to push the accredited voters to the back end,” he said. According to Bayode, if the thugs take the device to other places where they will manipulate the data on the device, the Presiding Officer, PO of the polling unit will report the incident. “If such a thing happens, the PO reports and from the back-end, that device is deactivated so that the person who took away that device will not be able to do anything with the device,” he said.
