The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum, AYCF, has accused some elder statesmen of working with politicians afraid of defeat to cause violence after the 2023 general election. AYCF, while reacting to the letter by former President Olusegun Obasanjo, accused the ex-leader of pretending to be addressing the challenges of the 2023 elections. In his latest open letter, Obasanjo had called for the cancellation of Saturday’s election results. The former president had said the results being announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, was not the will of Nigerians. However, AYCF National President, Yerima Shettima, said Obasanjo should take a cue from former military Heads of State, Ibrahim Babangida, Yakubu Gowon, and former President Goodluck Jonathan who have been non-partisan. A statement by Shettima reads partly: “Our attention has been drawn to a viral news in which otherwise elderstatesmen are working hand-in-hand with politicians who are afraid of defeat in the 2023 elections to overheat the polity and eventually destabilize this nation. “We were taken aback by the so-called letter of Obasanjo, making provocative statements, in his usual manner of pretending to be addressing our current challenges in the 2023 elections. “It is worrisome that the former President is often the only one taking dangerous, narrow-minded stance on any political situation in Nigeria. We have had his contemporaries like Ibrahim Babangida, Abdussalami Abubakar – who is now one of the most outstanding, exemplary promoters of national peace and stability.” Shettima said Nigerians are disappointed with Obasanjo over his partisan activities and letters that lacked the power to positively effect a change in the country.
