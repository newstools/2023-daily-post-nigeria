Ahead of the 25 February presidential election, most Nigerians said they do not trust the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to conduct free and fair elections. According to the latest survey by the Afrobarometer, a significant number of Nigerians believed that elections are the best method to choose their leaders and most agreed that the last national election in 2019 was generally free and fair, but the general findings show that popular trust in INEC is declining According to the results, a majority representing 56% of respondents, considered the last national election in 2019 free and fair, but almost four in 10 (38%) believed otherwise. While only 23% of Nigerians trust INEC “a lot,” more than 78% expressed “no trust” in the election-management body.
