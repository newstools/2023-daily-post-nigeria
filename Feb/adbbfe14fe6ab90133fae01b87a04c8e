The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has reacted to a gaffe made by the National chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Iyorchia Ayu, during the party’s presidential campaign in Kano State. Recall that Ayu had on Thursday, during the party’s presidential campaign held in Kano State, said that PDP had brought shame and should not be allowed to retain power. He was supposed to mean the All Progressives Congress, APC. However, Wike said that Ayu’s statement that the PDP brought shame to Nigeria was not a gaffe but an authentic remark from the abundance of his heart. Wike spoke during the Rivers State PDP Campaign in Eleme Local Government Area. “When you see undertakers, you will know those who came to kill this party. But the party will not die; they will die first. I didn’t know they were wicked to this party; no wonder they left this party and joined ACN before. “He (Ayu) said they will not allow PDP to be in power; is that a good chairman? Is that not anti-party? Is the chairman not doing (sic) anti-party? Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks. For us in Rivers State, our own party is a good party. Our own is a party that has done Rivers State well,” Wike said.
