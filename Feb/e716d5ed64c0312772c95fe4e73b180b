Two prominent individuals mentioned in the lingering communal conflict in Demsa Local Government Area of Adamawa State on Friday threatened to sue those linking them to the conflict. DAILY POST recalls that the Dingle Uboh clan of Mayah community of Demsa on Thursday held a press briefing in the state capital, Yola, where they spoke about a communal clash over a parcel of land that led to eight people ending up in the hospital for various injuries while hundreds of others are homeless. The spokesman, Chindo Hebron, who accused the Wanela Wagowang clan of triggering the crisis, had referred to Philemon Leha, a former Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police, and Kennedy Dauda, a former permanent secretary in the Adamawa State Civil Service, as “conflict entrepreneurs” fuelling the crisis. However, the pair on Friday afternoon, through their lawyer, Barr Ehimikhua Godwin, denied any involvement in the communal conflict. “The allegation against the two gentlemen is totally false, unfounded, spurious and cannot be substantiated with any credible evidence,” Godwin said. The lawyer specifically asked the spokesman of the Dingle Uboh clan, Hebron Chindo and others who led the clan to the Thursday briefing, to withdraw their “malicious” allegations within 14 days or face a lawsuit.
