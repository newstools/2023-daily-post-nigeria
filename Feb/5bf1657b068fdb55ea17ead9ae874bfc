Arsenal and Manchester City have been charged by the Football Association (FA) for being unable to control their players during both teams’ Premier League clash on Wednesday. Man City picked up a crucial three points against Arsenal at the Emirates as the match ended 3-1 in favour of the Citizens. The result moved Pep Guardiola’s side to the number one position on the Premier League table with goals difference ahead of second-placed Arsenal. Though Mikel Arteta’s men still have a game in hand.
