Manchester City goalkeeper, Ederson, has revealed the two aspects that Arsenal’s Gabriel Jesus is better than teammate Erling Haaland. T Jesus left Man City for Arsenal last summer, while Pep Guardiola’s side signed Haaland from Dortmund. But Ederson believes Jesus is more versatile and stronger than Haaland. The Brazilian told UEFA, “When [Erling Haaland] arrived, we said he was going to score a lot – and that has been happening. He’s a brilliant goalscorer, he always looks to score and help the team. “He’s the striker we needed because in comparison to Gabriel [Jesus], they’re different players: Gabi likes to come in from out wide, he is stronger and more versatile; Haaland plays more centrally, looking to get into the box, he’s a target in the area.” “That has been the major difference. When you get into the final third, you have someone who will always be in the area,” he added.
