A Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt has granted an order restraining the Rivers State Government, led by Governor Nyesom Wike; the Department of State Services, DSS; and the Nigeria Police Force, NPF; from arresting and intimidating members of the Atiku Campaign Council in the State. Justice A.T Ibrahim issued the order against the DSS and the police following a motion ex parte filed by leaders of the Rivers State Atiku/Okowa Campaign Council. The Council Spokesperson, Dr Leloonu Nwibubasa, on Wednesday, noted that Atiku Abubakarâ€™s supporters are now protected by the court order after some of them were arraigned on Tuesday before a Magistrate Court, Premium Times reported. Over 20 of those arraigned were reportedly remanded in prison. And the case was adjourned to the 22nd of March for a hearing of bail application. The applicants in the suit are former National Chairman of PDP, Uche Secondus; Chairman of the Council, Senator Lee Maeba; Former Transportation Minister and Director General of the Council, Dr. Abiye Sekibo; Senator Thompson George Sekibo, and Celestine Omehia (derecognised former Governor). Others are: Former Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Austin Opara; Member House of Representatives, Chinyere Igwe; immediate past Commissioner for Water Resources, Tamuno Sisi Gogo Jaja; and Spokesman of the Council, Dr Leloonu Nwibubasa; among others. Justice Ibrahim ordered the government and other respondents to maintain the status quo until the determination of the suit. Recall that Nwibubasa had recently accused the State Governor, Nyesom Wike, of using security operatives to arrest 35 supporters of Atiku during a meeting in Port Harcourt.
