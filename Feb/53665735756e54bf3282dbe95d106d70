Barely 24 hours to the presidential election, the North has been accused of systematically betraying the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. Deji Adeyanju, a social media influencer, said most Northern religious leaders have dumped Tinubu for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. The socio-political activist disclosed this in a series of tweets. Adeyanju linked the current trend to the action of the Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate, Peter Obi. He accused Obi of playing the religious card by visiting churches to seek for votes. According to Adeyanju: “The North betraying Tinubu systematically. Almost all major religious leaders in the North have endorsed Atiku. “Someone says today’s sermon in the mosques will be direct and unequivocal. That it is not only Christian leaders who know how to endorse their own. See what Obi caused. “Didn’t we all condemn the Muslim-Muslim ticket here? Did you have to start moving from church to church as a presidential candidate because of that then get pastors in the country to openly preach with your logo and pictures in churches? Obi made this election about religion. “After listening to the message by Sheik Dahiru Bauchi endorsing Atiku on Freedom Radio, let me put it on record again that: I condemn, I condemn and I condemn the use of religion for politics. It does not matter whether it is done by Christian or Muslim leaders, it is not good. “Shame on Obi for making 2023 election about religion. He started going from church to church from the beginning of his campaign because he doesn’t have structure and wanted the church to become his structure. Then forced pastors to endorse him. Now, imams doing same for others.”
