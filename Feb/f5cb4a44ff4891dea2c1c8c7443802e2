Former Liverpool star, Danny Murphy, has hit out at Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag for ‘whining and winging’ about midfielder Christian Eriksen’s injury. Man United are set to miss Eriksen for three months after the Denmark international sustained an injury from Reading striker Andy Carroll. The Red Devils saw off Reading with a 3-1 victory in the fourth round of the FA Cup last weekend, but Ten Hag was disappointed over Eriksen’s injury. After the game, Ten Hag accused Carroll of dangerous play and demanded more protection from the officials. But Murphy has now slammed the Dutchman for his remarks, claiming Carroll was sent off anyway after picking up two yellow cards during the encounter. Murphy told talkSPORT: “I just don’t see why you would come out and winged about it when it is just a consequence of playing football. He is lost, Eriksen and he is disappointed, and we don’t want to see bad tackles… but he is winging because then he starts bringing up the elbow on Martinez!” “I don’t mind him saying, ‘I am disappointed with the tackle, it was naughty, Carroll should have been sent off, it was bad, and I am disappointed for Eriksen, but it is football, it happens, that’s why we have a big squad, and we’ve got to get on with it’.”
