Commercial activities were on Tuesday paralysed as angry residents trooped out to protest the lingering scarcity of the new naira notes of N200, N500, and N1000. The protest took place at Sango-Ota, Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government area of Ogun State. Residents who had been going to banks for withdrawal said they could not access their money. They were said to have become more agitated when the commercial banks refused to accept the old naira notes as deposits. On Tuesday, the protesters barricaded the Joju junction of the Idiroko-Ota road, causing heavy gridlock. With bonfires on the road, the people castigated the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government, accusing the All Progressives Congress (APC) of inflicting hardship on the masses. Meanwhile, policemen have been mobilised to secure banks and their workers in Sango-Ota. Recall that a violent protest rocked Abeokuta last week, in which banks were attacked and one person shot.
