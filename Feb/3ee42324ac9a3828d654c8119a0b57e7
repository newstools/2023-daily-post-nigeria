Five days before the general elections, the leadership of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Osun State has tasked members and supporters of the party to observe a three-day fasting and prayer. The aim of the exercise according to Tajudeen Lawal, the acting chairman of the party in the state, is to seek the favour of God for the smooth conduct of the elections. Lawal in the statement issued by the party’s Director of Media and Information, Kola Olabisi on Tuesday in Osogbo hinted that APC does not joke with the potency of fasting and prayer as there is no logjam that cannot be remedied by the all-knowing God, especially when communicated to Him through fasting and prayer. “The fasting and prayer session should be held between tomorrow (Wednesday) and Friday which is the eve of the conduct of the presidential and National Assembly elections. “The prayer point of the APC members and supporters should be that God Almighty should finish His work which He had started a long time ago on the presidential candidate of the party, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and all the party’s national and state assemblies’ candidates.” Lawal also enjoined party members to, in their supplications to God, pray for a crisis-free election and subsequent victory of all the party’s candidates. While reminding the members and supporters of the party that their permanent voter cards should be within reach to enable them to participate actively in the elections, he pleaded with them to observe all the INEC directives to the letter to avoid voids and cancellations of their votes. “APC members and supporters should resist any act of provocation by the enemies of democracy which could lead to the promotion of crisis before, during and after the elections,” he concluded.
