Recently evicted Big Brother Titans, BBTitans, housemate, Theo Traw has said he felt excluded during his stay on the reality show. Speaking with Ebuka Obi Uchendu after his eviction, Traw said he felt like “the odd housemate.” The South African singer, who noted that his personality might have contributed to the exclusion, said, “I felt like they always exclude me in certain things and felt like I was always the odd one out for some reason. ”I had a lot of experiences in the house where I would try to have a chat with someone, but it would not extend because their favourite person would come, and the conversation just dies. “I always take my time to get to know people. My personality is a bit different. I did not have too many one on ones. I wanted that for myself, but I didn’t have it. No one is willing to listen to me.” Reacting to being paired with fellow evictee Sandra, Traw said, “I didn’t have any issues with her, and I was cool with it. But I was amazed by her reaction after we got evicted. She was not really happy. I did not know how to handle it.” Recall that Sandra had earlier, in her chat with Ebuka Obi Uchendu after their eviction, stated that it was quite unfortunate that she was paired with Theo Traw, who she described as the most nonchalant person ever, adding that ”he’s alright, but probably not for me.”
