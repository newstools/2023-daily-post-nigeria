Chelsea are keen to sign Nigerian striker, Victor Osimhen, for their manager Graham Potter. According to Simon Phillips via GiveMeSport, Chelsea are interested in Osimhen, who currently plays his club football for Napoli. The Premier League giants have been scouting Osimhen for a while and want to bring him to Stamford Bridge in the summer this year. “Victor Osimhen is definitely one on the radar and last season, when the new owners came in, one of the first scouting missions they set up was to watch Napoli regularly,” Phillips said. “Then there were a few other players that they were watching as well. But he is definitely one they have been scouting regularly this season and last season. “He is definitely on Chelsea’s shortlist of strikers and he is probably quite high up there.” Osimhen has been in brilliant form for Napoli so far this season. The 24-year-old is currently the leading scorer in Serie A with 17 goals from 18 appearances for Napoli.
