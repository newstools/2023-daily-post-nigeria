The National Broadcasting Commission, NBC, has warned broadcast stations in the country against violating relevant regulations guiding the broadcast of elections in Nigeria. This was contained in a statement signed by the NBC Director General, Balarabe Shehu Ilelah, who observed with deep concerns, how ethics have been thrown to the winds by politicians using the broadcast media in a manner that violates the provisions of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code. Ilelah, who stressed that hate speech, inflammatory, derogatory and divisive remarks are prohibited by the code, warned that sanctions await any broadcasting station found to have violated the code. The statement said: “The NBC Act CAP N11, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, prescribes, in the Third Schedule, that ‘A Licensee shall be responsible for the content of the station’s broadcast.” The NBC boss warned broadcasters to desist from allowing their platforms and facilities to be used by politicians, their supporters and sympathisers for the broadcast of contents that may lead to the breakdown of law and order. Ilelah urged broadcast organisations to perform the role of peace agents by adhering to the principles of responsibility, accuracy and neutrality.
