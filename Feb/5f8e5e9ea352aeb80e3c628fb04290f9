The Northern Elders Council, NEC, a socio-political organisation, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari that to ensure a rancour-free and transparent general elections, he must handle all situations leading to the exercise with caution. Mallam Tanko Yakasai, a leader of NEC, said some non-state actors within the corridors of power plan to use closeness to leadership to generate chaos and derail the electoral process for their selfish gains. The NEC, in a statement, enjoined the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration, in the country’s interest, to be wary of such elements. Yakasai, who had weeks ago expressed support for the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, assured that it would be making more policy statements in the coming days after its next congress on the state of the nation. “NEC, at all times, will not shy away from its commitment to peace, unity and stability of Nigeria,” Mallam Yakasai said in the statement. He hoped that Nigerians would not get it wrong at the coming polls by joining forces with progressive elements, stressing that the group had taken stock of developments in the nation’s political space.
