Seun Kuti, a Nigerian musician, and youngest son of the Afrobeat pioneer, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, has alleged that Peter Obi’s family wrecked the Anambra State economy. Kuti made the allegation in a video on his Instagram page. He said Anamabra State has bad roads and schools because Peter Obi does not pay taxes to the government. “Peter Obi put his money in Panama. Obi family are not paying tax in Anambra State. That is why Anambra State does not have good roads, good schools, good hospital. “People like Obi hide their money in Panama, far away from where Nigerian government can see it. If Obi loves Nigeria, why is he hiding money away from us to tax? “Any money in Panama, Nigerians cannot benefit from it. Obi makes all his money in Nigeria and hide in Panama. I have a right to criticize Obi.” He, therefore, admonished Peter Obi supporters saying, “ I am not in the game of picking the lesser evil, I don’t pick evil.”
