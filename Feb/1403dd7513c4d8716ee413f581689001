Paris Saint-Germain forward, Kylian Mbappe, is set to become the new captain of the France national team after news that Raphael Varane has retired from international duty. Recall that Varane had earlier on Thursday announced his retirement in a post via his Instagram account. France have been in the process of selecting a new captain since the end of the 2022 FIFA World Cup after Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris announced his international retirement. Varane was tipped to take on the captain armband, particularly after Karim Benzema also took the decision to retire, but on Thursday, the Manchester United defender revealed he, too, was walking away from the national team. This all marks a huge change for Les Blues following the bitter disappointment of losing the Qatar 2022 final to Argentina via penalties. However, French Football News is now reporting that Mbappe is set to take on the role of captain at just 24 years of age. The former Monaco star has been heralded as a leader for France in recent times, especially after he almost single-handedly saved his country in Decemberâ€™s final by scoring a hat-trick against Argentina.
