Famous Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh, has advised women to choose their children’s fathers carefully. Tonto warned the public to learn from her mistakes, noting that her mission is to show them how to survive a broken man and not to hate men. The actress, in a post shared on her Instagram page on Tuesday, said, “Dear women, choose the father of your child carefully. Don’t love me. Learn from me. I would live a fulfilled life forever if I could save one woman today. ”The mission is not to hate a man, but it’s on how to survive a broken man. There are always signs. Just look well.” This is coming days after Tonto advised single mothers not to stop telling their stories as their children would question why they never fought for themselves or told their truth, insisting that a good dad doesn’t have to be a good husband. The actress and her ex-husband Olakunle Churchill have been on social media dragging each other over their son, King Andre. Recall that Tonto Dikeh had a few days ago slammed Churchill for posting their son on his birthday to give the impression he is trying to be in the child’s life. Tonto further disclosed that Churchill is just a sperm donor, and she regrets choosing him as one for her son.
