Popular Nollywood actress, Angela Okorie has admonished her female colleagues in the industry to stop lying that acting alone is behind their lavish lifestyle. Angela explained how many upcoming actresses, who have just appeared in five movies, flaunt mansions and credit the industry for their expensive possessions. The actress, in her interview with Factory 78, noted that many of her colleagues have other side hustles to fund their luxurious lifestyle. She said: “Talking about females making it more than the males, it’s not as if the males are not making it but people should stop lying. All these females should stop lying. You are not even up to a year in Nollywood. You will come and lie to people that you just bought a house. Please tell me which money you use to buy the house. ”And you will be telling people that they are paying you. Oga, you are not earning more than me. And the last time I checked, you have not even done up to ten movies. So, how do you want to compare yourself to someone who has done more than 200 visuals to you who just did five visuals, and you are saying you bought a house? you guys should just stop lying. ”You can’t tell me it’s film money that’s giving you the money you use in buying a house. If there is something you are doing to earn money, you should say it.”
