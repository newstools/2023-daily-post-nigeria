Popular Nigerian singer Darlington Okoye, professionally known as Speed Darlington, has disclosed why entertainers settle for baby mamas rather than going into marriage. In a series of videos shared on his Instagram stories, Darlington noted that there is a tendency for musicians who get married and become parents in the entertainment industry to fail, attributing this to the effort and time required to raise children and maintain a successful marriage. Buttressing his point, he provided two examples of singers who have faced similar challenges named singer FoxyP and AfricanApe, whom he claimed lost focus after marriage. He stated the fear of going under the radar was why many entertainers would rather have a baby mama than legalise whatever they had with the women giving birth to their kids. He tagged wives and kids as dream killers for those in the industry, adding that it didn’t seem like he would want to marry because it sounded scary. “There’s a pattern. As soon as you have somebody, there’s a child, and you fade. It doesn’t sound like something I want to do. It’s very scary,” he said.
