The Niger State Police Command has arrested a suspected ritualist, 38-year-old Abdulrahman Woru, with a human skull at Babana, Borgu Local Government Area of the state. The suspect, who resides in Babana, is from Gbesewona village of Benin Republic. The Police stated this in a statement signed by the Public Relations Officer, PRO, DSP Wasiu Abiodun, in Minna. He said the suspect was arrested on 24 January 2023 based on a tip-off. He explained that the suspect was arrested at Babana after he was suspected of being in possession of a human skull. According to him, “when a search was conducted in his house a human skull, three pieces of suspected human ribs, two idols and cash sum of 5000 CFA of Benin Rep currency were recovered. “During interrogation, he confessed that the human skull recovered belonged to him. He claimed that he migrated from Benin Rep to Nigeria about four years ago for his business, without any immigration document, and that he is a traditional medicine practitioner.” Abiodun also said the suspect further claimed that he recently travelled to Benin Rep, and while entering Nigeria, he saw a bag on the road with the skull in it. “He (suspect) said he tied it on his motorcycle and took it home, because he believed it will be useful for his work, and he did not report to the Police,” the state Police spokesman disclosed. “The Command appreciates the support of Nigerlites and members of the public, and urge them not to relent by informing the police when they see something strange in their environment for quick intervention.” The suspect will soon be arraigned before a court of competent jurisdiction for prosecution.
