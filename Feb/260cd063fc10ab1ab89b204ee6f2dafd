The Military has assured Nigerians that the 2023 elections would hold peacefully in the Southeast states and every other part of the nation in spite of threats by criminal elements. The Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, gave the assurance in Abuja at the 25th edition of President Muhammadu Buhari Scorecard Series. NAN reports that the edition featured the Minister of Defence, Bashir Magashi, who presented the scorecard of the ministry. Responding to a question on the threat by the Simon Ekpa-led faction of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to stop this year’s general elections in the southeast states, Irabor said no person or group could stop the polls. He said: “The armed forces are working in concert with the Police and other security agencies to ensure that the menace of criminalities from IPOB and Eastern Security Network are eliminated.” Irabor also corroborated the position of Magashi that “no territory of Nigeria is under the control of Boko Haram or any other terrorist group.” According to him, all communities in the North East zone of Nigeria had been liberated from criminal elements.
