Arsenal’s new signing, Jorginho has named three things he would bring to the Gunners. Jorginho joined Arsenal from Chelsea on January transfer deadline day (Tuesday night). The Italy international signed an 18-month contract with Mikel Arteta’s side after switching from west London to North London in a deal worth around £12million. Speaking at his first interview after joining Arsenal, the 31-year-old said, “I will try to just bring positive energy, hard work and my experience to help the team. It’s what I always bring with me. “I try just to help with the experience I’ve had in my time with the other clubs and anything I can do just to help the team to achieve more and more, that is my target. “All I can promise is that I’m going to give my all to represent this club.” Jorginho could make his Arsenal debut this weekend when they face Everton at Goodison Park.
