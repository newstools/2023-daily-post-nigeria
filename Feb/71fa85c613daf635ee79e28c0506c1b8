Former Nigerian midfielder Jay-Jay Okocha has predicted who will win the 2022-23 Premier League title. Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal are sitting five points above second-placed Manchester City with a game in hand. Both Manchester City and Arsenal were defeated in their last Premier League outings last weekend. “Manchester City is surprisingly losing a lot of games this season for [their] standards,” Okocha, a former Bolton Wanderers star told wettfreunde. “Arsenal are consistently good, I assume the defeat at Everton was just a slip-up recently. “I trust Arsenal to become champions, but for that [they have] to do well in both duels against Man City.”
