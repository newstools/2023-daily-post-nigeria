Former Chelsea striker, Fernando Torres, has become the latest footballing personality to pick who is a better player between Paris Saint-Germain’s Lionel Messi and Al-Nassr’s Cristiano Ronaldo. Torres unhesitantly conceded that he preferred Messi over Ronaldo. Messi and Ronaldo are arguably the two best players of their time. With 12 Ballon d’Or awards, 1,400 club goals and nine UEFA Champions League trophies between them, Messi and Ronaldo have dominated the sport like no other. Messi even added the FIFA World Cup trophy to his collection last December in Qatar, which Ronaldo does not have in his corner. The Messi-Ronaldo debate has been raging on for over 12 years, with no definitive answer still in sight. Some of the most decorated footballing personalities have had their say over the years, with Torres being the latest to file his answer. Torres participated in the UEFA Champions League’s ‘This or That’ challenge on TikTok. With the goal in front of him, the Spaniard had to slot the ball either into Messi’s corner or Ronaldo’s corner. Without hesitation, the former Liverpool attacker rolled the ball into Messi’s corner. He also answered a few more questions in that segment, picking Steven Gerrard over Frank Lampard, Erling Haaland over Kylian Mbappe and Anfield over Stamford Bridge.
