Mary Edochie, popularly known as May Edochie, the first wife of the famous Nollywood actor and director, Yul Edochie has taken legal action against actress Sarah Chukwukere for sharing a photoshopped picture of actress Judy Austin in her family photo. Sharing the suit file on her Instagram page on Saturday, May noted that she had directed her lawyers to file a suit against Sarah Chukwukere, with the username @officialsarahmartins, for sharing an edited image of her and her children. She wrote: “It is demeaning and inconsiderate to smear anyone, especially someone you barely knew. I’ve always had a loving, joyful, and peaceful family. I worked tirelessly for years, building a beautiful home while managing several businesses successfully. “It is evident that some persons have deliberately and desperately tried to taint my reputation and “change the narrative” to suit their agenda. To me, this is unacceptable.” Warning others who may dare to do the same, she noted that her lawyer would be extremely cheerful to dine with anyone who does not cease from defamatory publications or character assassination. The lawsuit, shared by May, demanded a public apology and a retraction of the said defamatory publication as she threatened to sue for N500 million in damages if Sarah failed to meet the demands stated. Recall that May, during the 2022 Christmas celebration, took to her Instagram to share photos with their four children while wishing her fans a merry Christmas. Hours later, Sarah Chukwukere photoshopped Yul, his second wife Judy Austin and their baby boy inside the photo posted by May. Reacting to this, Yul wrote: “Yes, oo Sarah. Beautiful family. As it should be. Blessed man with blessed family. Everybody will be living in peace, love and jolly. May Zukwanuike.” Also, the actor had earlier boasted that he’s “proud to be a polygamist.” However, in her response, May said she would not be cajoled into accepting polygamy.
