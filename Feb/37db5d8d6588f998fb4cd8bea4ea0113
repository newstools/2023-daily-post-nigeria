As gladiators in the 2023 presidential elections gradually wind down their campaigns, elderstatesman and national leader of Afenifere, a pan yoruba socio-cultural group, Pa Ayo Adebanjo has insisted that Southerners would not fall for the plot by the Northern Elders Forum to impose another northerner on Nigerians in 2023. He said not when President Muhammadu Buhari has completed his eight years term. He made the assertion on Saturday at the venue of the Obi-Datti rally at the Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) in Lagos, noting that if Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party does not clinch the presidency in 2023, then there won’t be any nation called Nigeria again. His words, “If Obi does not become president in 2023, then we may as well forget Nigeria. The Northern elders now say I want to impose Obi on them. They want to impose a Northerner on us and we are saying No!”. “We are not here to sing and dance like the other parties. We must talk about how best to make this country work. We should be talking about how to remove area boys from the streets and provide jobs for them”. DAILY POST recalls that the 2023 presidential elections boast of strong contenders, in the person of Peter Obi of Labour Party, Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the All Progressive Congress, Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party PDP among others. While they have been going round the country selling themselves to the electorates, a recent survey by Bloomberg, a foreign media outfit puts Obi of Labour party as mostly favoured to clinch the presidency in 2023.
