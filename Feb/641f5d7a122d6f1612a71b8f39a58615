Former Nigerian lawmaker, Shehu Sani, has reacted to the shutting down of a shopping complex by the Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, for refusing to accept old Naira notes. Sani said the punishment was too harsh. The statement was contained in a post via his verified Twitter handle on Sunday. Recall that the Kano Consumer Protection Council, KCPC, had, on the instruction of Ganduje, shut down the WellCare shopping complex for refusing to accept old Naira notes. KCPC said WellCare supermarket refused to accept old naira notes from customers against instruction by the State government to continue accepting them. The council also said that legal action would be taken against the supermarket. However, Sani has described the treatment meted out to the supermarket as repressive. “Kano State shutting down a Mall because of the rejection of old Naira notes is repressive,” he tweeted.
