The Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC) has joined the public outcry over the scarcity of new naira notes. The leaders urged the Federal Government to find lasting solutions to the paucity of cash and fuel nationwide. TUC President, Festus Osifo and the Secretary General, Nuhu Toro, in a statement, demanded that the situation be resolved within one week. They expressed bewilderment about how the country is being dragged through “the twin crises” of currency and fuel shortages. “We are worried that smaller denominations of N100 and N50 notes were not affected by the Naira redesign, but not in circulation anywhere.” TUC charged President Muhammadu Buhari to order the CBN and banks to make cash available “without further delay”. The labour organisation called for adequate supply of petrol to fuel stations and sale at the official price. The union further advised the government and officials to act timely to prevent things from getting out of hand.
