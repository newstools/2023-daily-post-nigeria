Former Tottenham Hotspur striker, Jermain Defoe, has chosen Barcelona legend Xavi as the better player when compared to Real Madrid ace Luka Modric. Defoe played alongside Modric at Tottenham but claims Xavi, who is now the manager of Barcelona, was a far superior player. The former England international pointed out that opposition players could not get close to Xavi. Speaking on Rio Ferdinand’s FIVE YouTube Channel, Defoe insisted that Modric was a special talent but could not be compared to Xavi. Defoe said, “Luka was special, but Xavi was like a satnav. If I was a young midfielder and I had not really seen him play, I would be studying him. “You talk about masterclass and not giving the ball away, being that gifted. People could not get near him, so yeah… Xavi.”
