All Progressives Congress, APC, candidate in the Osun State governorship election, Adegboyega Oyetola has approached the Court of Appeal to further seek the disqualification of Governor Ademola Adeleke. The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, had on July 17 announced Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, as winner of the July 16, 2022 poll. Former Governor Oyetola and the APC challenged the victory on the grounds that there was over-voting and that Adeleke was not eligible to run at the time. The Tribunal said though Oyetola and APC proved a case of forgery against the Osun Governor, it was not enough to make him ineligible since he had acquired additional qualifications. The Tribunal however held that there was indeed over-voting and it deducted the invalid votes from the valid votes and declared Oyetola as winner of that election. Dissatisfied, INEC, Adeleke and the PDP have appealed the judgement. The governor last week expressed confidence that heâ€™ll defeat his predecessor. The cross-appeal by Oyetola and the APC is being defended by Lateef Fagbemi, SAN, and Akin Olujimi, SAN. They argue that the Tribunal misdirected itself when it held that the certificate from Atlanta Metropolitan College and a diploma certificate from Penn Foster High School are genuine.
