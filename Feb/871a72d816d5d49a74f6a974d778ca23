The Director-General of the Atiku-Okowa Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Presidential Campaign Council in Rivers State, Abiye Sekibo, has accused the state Governor, Nyesom Wike of ordering his loyalists and followers to support the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. Sekibo disclosed this while reacting to the revocation of the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium for the rally of the PDP presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar by the Rivers State government. The state government in January approved the venue for the event scheduled to hold on February 11, but later revoked the approval. However, Sekibo said Wike ordered all local government chairmen, his cabinet members, his aides, and executives to support Tinubu’s presidential ambition. A letter dated February 1, 2022, by Sekibo reads partly: “We are aware that by credible information reaching us that Governor Wike has directed his loyalists, including all local government Chairmen, special adviser, commissioners, party executives at the state and local government level, and all other appointees to work for the APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, even though you have not had the courage to boldly announce same to the people of Rivers State.” Wike fell out with Atiku after he lost the PDP ticket to the former Vice President. Following the fallout, the Rivers State governor had refused to endorse Atiku as his presidential candidate.
