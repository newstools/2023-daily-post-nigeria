Former Chelsea star, Jason Cundy has hailed Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag, saying there is no manager better than the Dutchman in the English top flight at the moment. He said the Red Devils manager deserves the most credit for their win over Barcelona in the Europa League play-off on Thursday. Manchester United overpowered Barcelona in an enthralling Europa League play-off last night. The Red Devils ran out 4-3 winners on aggregate to set up a last-16 clash with another Spanish side Real Betis. But United came back transformed after the break with Fred equalising just 82 seconds into the restart. “Ten Hag has come in and in a relatively short space of time he’s got his hands on these players, got his hands on the squad and he’s moulded them into a really, really good team,” Cundy said on The Sports Bar. “Right now, result for the result, I am putting him in the same breath as Pep Guardiola… right now there isn’t a better manager in the Premier League than Ten Hag.”
