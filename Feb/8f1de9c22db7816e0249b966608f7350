Prophet Bisi Olujobi says he foresees victory for the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate Bola Tinubu. The General Overseer of Wisdom Church of Christ International in Ketu, Lagos said this in a statement on Tuesday. Olujobi said despite the “confusion, intrigues, suspense, uncertainties and many predictions called prophesies from diverse priests”, Tinubu will win. Tinubu is seeking to lead Nigeria after over three decades in politics and alliances that boosted the chances of President Muhammadu Buhari in the 2015 and 2019 polls. The former Lagos governor is contesting against other frontrunners, Atiku Abubakar (PDP), Peter Obi (LP) and Rabiu Kwankwaso (NNPP). Noting that “Tinubu’s victory is certain”, Olujobi indicated he would need “wisdom and great restraint as he is fighting a stronger inner conspiracy”. The cleric urged Tinubu to “be wise as a serpent and meek as a dove if he doesn’t want his victory to turn out like that of (M.K.O.) Abiola”. “Those closest to him should warn him and if possible interpret this message. I see his victory, but I don’t see him rule except he prays very well.” The statement added that the aftermath of the 2023 general polls should be the paramount concern of all Nigerians. “The devil is planning to shed blood which I forewarned last year. Let everybody engage in intense prayer against ethnic war as a result of the outcome of this election,” Olujobi advised.
