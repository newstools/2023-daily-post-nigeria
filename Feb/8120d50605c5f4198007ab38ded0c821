The So-Safe Corps in Ogun State, on Wednesday, apprehended a notorious robbery suspect after fleeing from the Republic of Benin into Nigeria. The So-Safe Corps Commander, Soji Ganzallo, in a statement through his spokesman, Moruf Yusuf, said that the So-Safe Corps and the authorities from Republic of Benin have good security relationship, which aided the arrest of the said suspect in Ogun. Ganzallo stated that the Beninoise police had alerted the corps few weeks ago to assist in apprehending the robbery suspect, Mishodi Awiagin, “who escaped arrest and was suspected to be hibernating in Nigeria while the kingpin of the team is in their custody.” Ganzallo said that the wanted robbery suspect was sighted by a patrol team in Ayetoro, Ipokia Local Government Area of Ogun State. “Sighting the security agency, the suspect took to his heels and he was given a hot chase. He was captured alive without any injury,” he said. The Commander spoke further that the suspect confessed during preliminary investigation that he is a native doctor in Benin Republic and that “he truly fled to escape being arrested for his involvement in a number of serious crimes.” Ganzallo disclosed that the suspect had been transferred to Sakete police station in Benin Republic.
