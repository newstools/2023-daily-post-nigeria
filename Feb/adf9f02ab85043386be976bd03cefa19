Manchester United midfielder, Casemiro, will serve a three-game ban after being sent off for violent conduct in the Red Devils’ Premier League clash with Crystal Palace on Saturday. Man United and Crystal Palace players were involved in a fight in the second half at Old Trafford after Jeffrey Schlupp barged into Antony off the ball. Both Antony and Schlupp were given yellow cards by referee Andre Marriner, but VAR spotted Casemiro grabbing Crystal Palace midfielder Will Hughes by the throat during the commotion. After being asked to review the footage on the pitch side monitor, Marriner gave the Brazilian a red card, reducing Erik ten Hag’s side to 10 men for the final 22 minutes of the encounter. Casemiro has already served a one-game ban for picking up five cards, but he will now be forced to sit-out Man United’s next three Premier League matches after being sent off for violent conduct. The first game Casemiro will miss is against Leeds United at Old Trafford on Wednesday. The former Real Madrid star will then miss Man United’s trip to Elland Road next Sunday. The final game of the 30-year-old’s suspension will be against Leicester City on February 19, which means he will be available for their Carabao Cup final against Newcastle United on February 26.
