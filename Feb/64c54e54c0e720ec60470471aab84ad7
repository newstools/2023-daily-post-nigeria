Niger Tornadoes head coach, Abubakar Bala Mohammed has assured fans of the club that his team will improve their performance during the second half of the season. The Ikon Allah Boys ended their six-game winless run with a hard-earned 1-0 win against Dakkada on Sunday. Mohammed’s side started the campaign on an impressive note winning their opening two games. The Minna club then slumped afterwards before ending the barren run against Dakkada. “You can see that there is a little improvement in the area of converting chances; that we have been working on, even though a lot still needs to be done. The players were a bit calm in front of goal today despite the fact that many chances were also squandered,” Mohammed said after the game. “One area which is quite disturbing is anxiousness in front of goal, however, we have taken note and will work on that before the league restarts.”
