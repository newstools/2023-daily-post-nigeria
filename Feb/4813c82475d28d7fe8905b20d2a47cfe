Video Assistant Referee, VAR Lee Mason is leaving the PGMOL, according to SportsMail. This means he will no longer officiate in the Premier League. It is understood Mason quit his role by mutual consent, a week after making a major mistake in Arsenal’s 1-1 draw with Brentford. The VAR incorrectly allowed Ivan Toney’s goal to stand, after forgetting to check if Christian Norgaard was offside. It left Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta furious, as the error could prove costly in their race to beat Manchester City to the Premier League title. The Gunners are now in second place after losing 3-1 to Manchester City on Wednesday.
