The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential Campaign Council for Atiku Abubakar said the party shelved its campaign rally in Rivers State to avoid bloodshed. The spokesperson Charles Aniagwu, on Tuesday in Asaba, said the cancellation became necessary due to rising spate of insecurity in the state. The leading opposition party added that the Governor Nyesom Wike has been undiplomatic through his actions and utterances. Aniagwu said the party opted out of the rally because Atiku and his running mate, Ifeanyi Okowa believe their ambition was not worth the blood of any Nigerian. The Delta Commissioner for Information disclosed Atiku examined the scenario playing out in Rivers and canceled the rally. â€œYes he may have enough policemen to secure him, his running mate, Okowa and indeed some leaders.
