Manchester United manager, Erik ten Hag, has described their Carabao Cup final opponents Newcastle United as an “annoying team to play against.” Ten Hag is looking to win the first trophy of his Old Trafford reign on Sunday. United’s last piece of silverware came in 2017 when they lifted the Europa League title under Jose Mourinho. Newcastle have been accused of time-wasting in matches by both Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp. “They’re an annoying team to play against, so we have to find a way to win. “They try to annoy you. We have to make sure that we play our game and we focus on our game. You see the referee wants to play an effective time. “They have the lowest in the league and they are quite successful with it. So it’s up to us that we get speed in the game and we are also then dependent on the refereeing as well,” Ten Hag said.
