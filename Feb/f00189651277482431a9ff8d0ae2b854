The Inspector-General of Police, Mr Usman Alkali, on Wednesday, insisted that the police are investigating some governors and individuals whose utterances are considered to have incited riots over the naira redesign policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN. Alkali stated this in Abuja while fielding questions from State House correspondents. The IGP was accompanied to the news conference by the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, at the end of Wednesday’s National Security Council (NEC) meeting, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari. Alkali disclosed that those found guilty would definitely be prosecuted. According to him, the Police were not in a position to prosecute culpable governors because they enjoyed immunity. Governors Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State, Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State and Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State had openly condemned the implementation of the CBN’s naira swap policy. They asked citizens of their states to continue to spend the old N500 and N1000 as legal tenders. “We all know why the governors haven’t been cautioned. We are investigating. Whoever does anything can be investigated,” Akali said. “However, there are some people who have immunity. I think that’s one of the reasons why they haven’t been cautioned. “The immunity will not stop us from cautioning them; from warning them; from advising them; and we’re doing so.”
