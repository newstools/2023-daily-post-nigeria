A group under the auspices of Ikot Ekpene Senatorial District People’s Assembly has called for a probe into the activities of fake soldiers, INEC officials and policemen during the presidential and National Assembly elections, in Ikot Ekpene Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State. There were stories that officers of the Nigerian Army on Saturday during the Presidential and National Assembly elections apprehended a busload of fake soldiers, policemen and INEC staff. The group in a statement on Sunday by its chairman and secretary, Dr Akaninyene Ukpong and David Eshiet, commended the Nigerian Army for the feat and urged the Commissioner of Police not to succumb to any pressure from politicians. The statement reads in part: “We have received credible intelligence that the men of the Nigerian Army in Akwa Ibom State have apprehended several busloads of fake army officials, officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission and [officers of] the Nigerian Police Force, who were patrolling units in Ikot Ekpene senatorial district and tampering with the outcome of the elections in many wards and local government areas.” The group while commending the officers of the Nigerian Army for their prompt action, asked to be informed about the status of the case. The statement added: “We call on the Commissioner of Police to brief the public on this matter and to resist the pressure to release these criminals. They must be made to face the full wrath of the law.” When contacted, Police Public Relations Officer Odiko Macdon said he cannot confirm the story. He, however, disclosed: “Several arrests were made during the election but cannot say whether they are fake soldiers or police or INEC staff until investigation is over.”
