Former Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper, Brad Friedel, has advised Chelsea’s Christian Pulisic and Arsenal’s Matt Turner should leave their respective club sides this summer. Pulisic, who Chelsea bought as Eden Hazard’s replacement at Stamford Bridge, has not really impressed following his £58m move from Borussia Dortmund back in 2019. Turner, on the other hand, has made just six appearances for Arsenal – all in cup competitions – since joining the Gunners from MLS side New England Revolution last year. “It goes back to having too many players at Chelsea. Look at who he is up against,” Friedel said of Pulisic’s future in an interview with Sporting Post. “I have never spoken to him, so I don’t know what he wants, whether he wants to stay and fight for his place or if he wants a new challenge. “It is going to be one of those summers where either he is told he is in Chelsea’s plans and they offer him a new deal, or he gets sold. “Looking at things, I’m thinking it is probably the latter and we will see him somewhere else, which could be good for him to play consistently.” Friedel added: “I think that Matt [Turner], no matter what, even though Arsenal are an incredible club, has to find consistent football somewhere. This season, fine, but if he isn’t going to be the number one, he has got to go.”
