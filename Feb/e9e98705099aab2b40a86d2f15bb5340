The Coalition of South East Youth Leaders, COSEYL, has demanded the arrest of the head of the Lagos State Parks Management Committee, Musiliu Akinsanya also known as MC Oluomo for allegedly intimidating voters during the Saturday election. The coalition alleged that MC Oluomo and his boys forced the officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC to alter the presidential election results. In a statement issued by its President General, Goodluck Ibem after the protest, the coalition also tackled the INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmoud Yakubu, saying he was compromised. According to the statement, most of the results trickling in from states, particularly Lagos, Ekiti, Rivers and others were not the original results. The statement reads in part: “Before the elections, we were told by the National Chairman, Professor Mahmoud Yakubu that INEC results will be transmitted immediately from the polling units to the INEC portal. But what played out on Saturday was the direct opposite of what we were told. “INEC refused to transmit results to the INEC portal which gave them time and opportunity to manipulate the process. We demand the cancellation of results in those areas where it was obvious that there was voting by underaged children. Eligible voters as stipulated in the electoral law must be 18 years and above and anything short of that cannot be accepted. There are videos and photos showing where underaged children were casting their votes and INEC should work with that information.”
