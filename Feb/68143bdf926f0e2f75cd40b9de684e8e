The Police Command in Osun has arrested a fake Department of State Service (DSS) officer. Operatives also caught seven suspected kidnappers as well as three others for conspiracy and armed robbery. Public Relations Officer, SP Yemisi Opalola on Tuesday said the suspects were nabbed in different operations. The spokesperson gave the identity of the DSS impersonator as Olaleye Oluseyi, 46 years old. Oluseyi allegedly collected money from people after claiming he could get them employment in the security agency. Operatives from the command swung into action after intelligence exposed the fraud. The police said Oluseyi confessed to have duped one Taiwo Victor of N112,000 on the pretext of securing a DSS job for him. “When he was arrested, a face cap with the inscription of the Federal Road Safety Corps was also found in his possession,” she added.. Opalola, however, announced a 23-year-old female and two others arrested for armed robbery. The duo entered Osigbo from Lagos January 28 and lodged into a hotel with the aid of the lady. They spied on victims and robbed 20 students of Federal Polytechnic Ede in their hostels, stealing 30 phones worth millions of naira.
