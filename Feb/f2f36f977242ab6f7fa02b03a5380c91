Former Liverpool player, Steve McManaman, has hit out at Jurgen Klopp’s side following their humiliating UEFA Champions League 5-2 defeat against Real Madrid on Tuesday night. McManaman branded Liverpool’s display against Real Madrid as a horror display, adding that the Premier League giants were absolutely ripped apart by Los Blancos. Real Madrid came from 2-0 down to beat the Reds at Anfield following goals from Karim Benzema, Vinicius and Eder Militao. “‘I think that sums it up, absolutely ripped apart,” McManaman told BT Sport after the game. “They’re caught again in the centre of the park, pounced upon, and when [Karim] Benzema has got the ball in the position he found himself, he’s the coolest man on the planet. “Have some of that, three people go one way and he just places it in. That’s another one in the collection.” He added, “To concede five goals at Anfield. Five goals at Anfield. From 2-0 up. “This will be a horror show for Liverpool for the players to look back and look at the mistakes in the last four goals. A chastening experience this evening.” Liverpool will face Carlo Ancelotti’s side in the return leg at Santiago Bernabeu in March.
