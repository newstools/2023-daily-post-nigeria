Operators of Point of Sale (POS) in Lokoja and its environs in Kogi State, on Thursday, stopped operation as the ongoing scarcity of the redesigned naira worsened. Most operators of POS in their interview with DAILY POST claimed that they stopped operation due to the lack of new naira from commercial banks. Other sources linked the development to CBN’s collaboration with EFCC and ICPC in carrying out Banks’ Branch Spot-Checks on ATMs which led to banks cutting off the supply to POS operators. Meanwhile, the effect of the scarcity of the new notes continued on Thursday with many people complaining of going to bed on “empty stomach” the previous night, adding that they were in dire need of money to buy food and meet other essential social and economic activities. At the Kogi State secretariat in Lokoja, some staff told DAILY POST their colleagues and other workers could not come to office because they had neither the old money or new ones to pay as transport fare.
