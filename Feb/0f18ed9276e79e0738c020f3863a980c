Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta is considering selling Folarin Balogun despite the striker outscoring the likes of Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe and Neymar in the French Ligue1 this season. The player has been in incredible goalscoring form on loan at French club Stade de Reims. Balogun moved to Ligue 1 on a season-long loan last summer and is the top scorer in France. Balogun, Arsenal academy product, is under contract with the Gunners until 2025. He has netted 14 goals and two assists across 21 top-flight games for Reims and the French club are said to be keen to turn his loan into a permanent deal. The Gunners are open to letting Balogun leave the Emirates in the summer, according to The Sun. The club would like to generate a 100 percent profit on the striker after spending considerable money in bringing in new players in the summer and January windows. The north London side brought in Leandro Trossard, Jakub Kiwior and Jorginho for a total sum of £59m in January. They had also spent £111m on Gabriel Jesus, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Fabio Vieira, while Matt Turner and Marquinhos arrived for undisclosed fees.
