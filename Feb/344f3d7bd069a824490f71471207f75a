Arsenal legend, Paul Merson, has claimed his former club would have won the title last weekend if they didn’t lose to Everton. The Gunners suffered a shock 1-0 defeat at Goodison Park. It was only the second time Mikel Arteta’s men have been beaten in the Premier League this season. A little over 24 hours later, second-placed Manchester City lost 1-0 at Tottenham. The game between Arsenal and City remains five points going into this weekend’s game, with the champions having played one game more. “Arsenal would have won the league on Saturday with a win at Goodison Park. “With what happened with Man City at Tottenham on Sunday, it would have all been wrapped up in my opinion. “They are the fine margins you are dealing with at this stage of the season,” Merson said.
