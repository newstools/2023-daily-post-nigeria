The new Commissioner of Police in Ebonyi State, Falaye Sunday Olaleye said following the disbandment of the Ebubeagu security outfit by the Federal High Court in Abakaliki, the outfit ceased to exist in the state. The disbandment of Ebubeagu generated mixed reactions and even resulted in protests by youths and other groups. The Ebonyi State Commissioner of Police has debunked the notion that the security outfit will be playing any role in the coming elections. Commissioner of Police Olaleye made the declaration while fielding questions from journalists at the Police Officers’ Mess, shortly after meeting with senior police officers in Police Headquarters, Abakaliki, capital of Ebonyi State. He vowed to work with all political parties in the state, without bias, to ensure that the general election taking place next Saturday is conducted in an atmosphere free of molestation and intimidation. According to him: “My plan for the state is to ensure that there is security for every citizen of Ebonyi State, that they can go about their business freely and sleep with their eyes closed and that in the coming elections on Saturday, people will move freely and exercise their franchise.” Olalaye also stated that the police force is out to serve everyone. “As a national security outfit, we are not to divulge our plans, but people will go about their business freely,” he stated. On the question of whether the police will be working with other security bodies in the state, he stated: “Ebubeagu doesn’t exist anymore, how do I work with what is not in existence?”
