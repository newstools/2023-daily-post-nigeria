President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday urged candidates contesting elections at all levels to respect the choice of voters and accept the result of the elections as announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Femi Adesina, special adviser to Buhari on media and publicity disclosed this in a statement. According to him, the President, who witnessed the signing of the Second Peace Accord for the 2023 Presidential elections at the International Conference Centre, Abuja, reminded the political class and their supporters that INEC is the agency empowered by law to announce the results. ”Any aggrieved candidate should resort to the established judicial processes, and we must have the confidence to trust our legal systems. ”I once again ask the candidates to abide by the spirit and letter of the Accord they have signed today. ”Let me remind all Nigerians not for the first time that this is the only country we have, and we must do everything to keep it safe, united and peaceful. ”There should be no riots or acts of violence after the announcement of the election results. All grievances, personal or institutional, should be channeled to the relevant courts,” he said.
