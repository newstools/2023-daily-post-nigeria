Former Aston Villa man, Gabriel Agbonlahor has told the FA to arrest and discipline Casemiro after the incident that saw the Brazilian sent off against Crystal Palace on Saturday. According to Agbonhalor, the former Real Madrid man thought he was a super star wrestler and wanted to strangle Crystal Palace’s Will Hughes. The midfielder was given a straight red card in the 2-1 win against Palace after grabbing Hughes by the throat in a mid-game melee. The melee began with a scuffle between Crystal Palace’s Jeffrey Schlupp and United’s Antony and the 2022 summer signing got involved as a number of players shoved one another. “Casemiro thought he was Brock Lesnar back in the UFC,” Agbonhalor told talkSPORT. “The way he was strangling Will Hughes, he should be arrested for that. Kids are watching that later on, on Match of the Day. Seeing Casemiro strangling an opponent. “This isn’t ice hockey in America where they have a scrap during the game. This is football, we don’t want to see that. “So Casemiro needs to be disciplined by Manchester United,” he said. Casemiro has been described by fans and pundits as one of the best players in the Red Devils squad this season since his £70 million move from Real Madrid. The Brazilian was just returning from a one-match ban before the red card incident that will now keep him out of action for another three games. Casemiro missed United’s defeat to Arsenal last weekend due to suspension. The 30-year-old picked up his fifth yellow card of the season in United’s draw with the same Crystal Palace team.
