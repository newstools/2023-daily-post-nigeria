The electorates in Osun have been charged to vote for the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Bola Ahmed Tinubu and all the party’s candidates for the National and State Houses of Assembly. This charge was given by Timothy Owoeye, the Speaker of the Osun State House of Assembly during the flag-off of his reelection campaign in Ilesa East local government council area on Tuesday.  Owoeye who emphasised that Tinubu remained the only candidate that could bring about the needed turn-around of the country added that the APC candidate would bring about a better and more developed Nigeria to the delight of Nigerian citizens. The Speaker also hinted that the Yoruba race would immensely benefit from it. “Like I have said earlier, a vote for me is a vote for experience, the state House of Assembly needs people with experience to stabilize the state, the peace and good governance of the state depend on a Stable Assembly. “We also must look at what Tinubu did in Lagos when he was governor. He has given the state a roadmap, the way he governed Lagos showed that Nigeria will not be difficult for him to handle,” the Speaker stressed.
