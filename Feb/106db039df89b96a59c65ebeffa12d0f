Reactions have trailed the Supreme Court’s nullification of the nomination of the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Taraba State. The judgement delivered today in Abuja, nullified the party’s primary that produced Senator Emmanuel Bwacha as the APC governorship candidate in Taraba State while the apex court also ordered a fresh primary election within 14 days. David Sabo Kente, one of the aggrieved aspirants had dragged Bwacha, APC and INEC to court on grounds that the party’s primary election did not take place in the state. Reacting, the Secretary of David Sabo Campaign Council, Shuaibu Ataka, said “the judgement is perfect” stressing that “we have long been waiting for a day like this.” Ataka, who held that APC in Taraba derailed by refusing to conduct the governorship primary election in the state said the Supreme Court “has vindicated us because we have been crying and shouting that there was no primary election here in our state.” Another chieftain of the party, Saleh Ahmadu, said: “What we are asking for, is for the party to do the right thing so that everybody in the party will be satisfied.” At the time of filing this report, the camp of Senator Bwacha remains mute over the judgement. His director of media and publicity, Aaron Artimas, promised to get back to DAILY POST correspondent when contacted.
