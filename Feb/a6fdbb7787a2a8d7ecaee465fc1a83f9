The Director General, Yobe State APC Campaign Council, Senator Mohammed Hassan has vowed that the ruling party will not allow PDP to secure the proposed 25% of votes in the state in the upcoming presidential election. Hassan made the declaration at a media briefing held to debunk the alleged attack on Gov Mai Mala Buni during the flag-off of the party’s campaign rally in Gashu’a recently. “I can confirm to you that, the presidential candidate of PDP, Atiku Abubakar is so desperate to get 25% of votes in Yobe; he is not going to get that, because we are not going to allow that to happen,” he vowed. On the alleged attack on Governor Buni in Gashu’a, Sen. Mohammed Hassan insisted that no such thing has happened during the campaign rally. “The rally as far as we are concerned―and all those who attended the rally can confirm that―the gathering was successful with a very large turnout of our members,” he said. He accused opposition parties in the state of sponsoring fake news to gain popularity. “I can tell you that, we feel there is a hand of opposition in such things, in terms of spreading fake news,” he alleged. According to the Director General, as the campaign train moves to Potiskum for Zone B rally, the party is re-strategizing to ensure another peaceful and successful outing.
