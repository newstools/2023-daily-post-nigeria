The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has handed sensitive materials to Imo State’s 27 local government areas for Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections. The distribution commenced from the Central Bank premises in Owerri shortly after the INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner in Imo State, Professor Sylvia Agu, received the materials under close observation of agents of political parties. After the exercise, Prof Agu informed journalists that everything was in place for the polls to run smoothly. Agu, however, raised an alarm over the unrest in Orlu, Orsu and Okigwe local government areas, which forced NYSC members scheduled to work as ad hoc staff in the elections to leave the areas. In an interview, party representatives Messrs Alphonsus Ebere, Martin Ejiogu and Cyprian Akaolisa expressed satisfaction with the process so far and urged INEC to keep up the pace. Others advised postponing the elections in the three affected local government areas so that security personnel could provide sufficient security for the elections to take place there.
