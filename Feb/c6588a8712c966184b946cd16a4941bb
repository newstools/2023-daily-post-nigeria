Pickpockets and other criminals had a field day robbing Kaduna bank customers who went to change their old notes at the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN. DAILY POST gathered that the criminals usually mixed with the bank customers, engaging in discussions and cheering them while they waited in queues. However, the criminals had disappeared by the time customers discovered their items were missing. Mrs James Onoja, on Saturday, cried profusely as she discovered that her husband’s car, which was parked close to the CBN gate Kaduna was stolen by an unknown person. “My husband drove me to the bank’s gate this morning with his car, as I came to deposit my N20,000 old notes. “As a uniform personnel, he tried to penetrate inside the bank, before he came out, thieves had stolen it,” she expressed tearfully. Also, Samuel Moses, who said he came with N30,000 to deposit at the CBN, said the money was stolen while struggling with others at the gate to enter the premises. Musa Anebi said criminals stole his motorcycle parked at the gate of the bank. ” I parked my motorcycle at the gate of the bank, but before I could finish talking to a bank’s security operatives, they had taken away the motorcycle,” he said.
