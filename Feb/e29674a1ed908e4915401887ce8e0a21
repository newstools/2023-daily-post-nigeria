With four days to the 2023 elections, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, has said his political ambition is not worth the blood of any Nigerian. Atiku spoke while addressing members of the Rivers State chapter of PDP in Abuja following the suspension of his rally in the state. He explained that the rally in Rivers State was suspended to protect the lives of people. The PDP presidential candidate pledged to include women and youths in his recovery plan if elected. Atiku also assured stakeholders from the state of completing the Port Harcourt to Maiduguri rail project and the deep seaport in Bonny. According to Atiku: “Our campaign and indeed the PDP subscribe fully to the position that no political ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian. “Rivers State and Rivers people are bound by destiny to be critical stakeholders and beneficiaries of the Atiku/Okowa presidency in multiple ways. “The uncompleted rail line from Onne Port to join the Port Harcourt–Maiduguri rail line, which has been on the drawing board for decades, will be completed speedily, while the deep seaport in Bonny will receive immediate attention.”
