The Nigerian Navy (NN) has rescued 18 victims of human trafficking in Kano State. The operation was carried out at Rijiyar Lemu in Ungogo Local Government Area, said Director of Information, Commodore A. Ayo-Vaughan. The rescue followed a tip off from an officer at the NN Finance and Logistics College (NNFLC) in Dawakin Tofa. The personnel hinted his sister and others were being trafficked through Kano enroute Libya and France. Ayo-Vaughan disclosed that an internal security team swung into action and localized Rijiyar Lemu and Bachirawa areas.  Reconnaissance eventually uncovered the young citizens who were housed in an uncompleted building in a community. “Two of the suspected traffickers were arrested while others are at large,” the spokesperson confirmed. The victims were taken to the Navy College where they received medication and other necessary attention. The suspects and persons rescued have been transferred to the National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP).
