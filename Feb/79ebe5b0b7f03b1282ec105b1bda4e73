The ad hoc committee investigating the currency swap of the Central Bank of Nigeria has invited the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, and Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Mahmood Yakubu for an interface on Thursday. The Committee, chaired by the Majority Leader, Ado Doguwa, also invited the National Security Adviser Babangana Monguno. The invitation is coming in the wake of an interim order issued by the Supreme Court that the CBN should suspend the February 10 deadline for the existence of the old notes. It would be recalled that the same committee had an interface with the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele but was unable to upturn the decision of the CBN. Similarly, INEC had also stated that the policy may affect the conduct of the elections as the commission needs cash to prosecute the election. However, Mr Emefiele had promised to provide money for the commission.
