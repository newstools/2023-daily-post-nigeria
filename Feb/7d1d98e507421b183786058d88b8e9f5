Croatian World Cup star, Josko Gvardiol, has suggested he wants to follow RB Leipzig teammate, Christopher Nkunku to Chelsea this summer. Gvardiol also said that he ‘struggled’ after failing to get his move to Stamford Bridge last summer. Chelsea were keen to sign the 21-year-old during the summer transfer window and reportedly saw a huge bid of £77m rejected by Leipzig in the final days of the window. In an interview with The Times, Gvardiol said, “My agent called me and said that Chelsea is extremely interested and, of course, you definitely think about a serious offer from a huge club like Chelsea. Leipzig said they did not want to sell me. “In the end I really struggled with that decision, but we did not make an agreement. It’s what it is. “I’m here and I’m fine with this because my idea has been to stay here. One season was not enough. This is my second season, even one more season would be great, but we will see.” He added, “I have never seen before a player like Christoph, he is unbelievable. “Every time I talk with someone about him I always say wherever he goes I want to go with him.” Recall that Nkunku will join Chelsea in the summer after signing a deal with the Blues.
