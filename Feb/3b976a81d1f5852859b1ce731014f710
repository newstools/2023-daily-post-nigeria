Uche Secondus, the former National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has given reasons why the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Abubakar will defeat the likes of Labour Party’s Peter Obi, All Progressives Congress’s Bola Tinubu, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso of New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). His comments are coming less than three days before the presidential election. Speaking on Arise Television’s Morning Show programme on Wednesday, Secondus said Atiku would emerge as the winner of Saturday’s presidential election because the former Vice President is a nationalist, bridge builder and a unifier. He claimed Atiku is physically fit to run Nigeria, adding that Nigerians know him very well. Secondus said, “It is two days to go, Thursday and Friday, Saturday is the election, the Nigerian people will elect Atiku and Okowa on that day, reasons are that the other candidates, Nigerians knows them very well, know those who are physically fit to run the country and know those who are not, to traverse the entire country, those who are regional leaders. “I don’t want to mention names. But I believe that Atiku Abubakar is a nationalist, he is known all over the country, he is a bridge builder, and he is a unifier. “All those credentials are the reasons why I believe, and other Nigerians believe, that Alhaji Atiku Abubakar will emerge the winner of this election on the 25 of February.”
