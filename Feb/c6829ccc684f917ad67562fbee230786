Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen, is reportedly set for a shocking move to La Liga giants Atletico Madrid at the end of the season. Osimhen has strongly established himself as one of the best strikers in Europe this season. The 24-year-old scored for Napoli against Empoli on Friday to take his goal tally to 19 in Serie A, despite playing just 20 matches for his team. The Nigerian international is behind just Manchester City’s Erling Haaland in the race for the Golden Shoe in Europe and is six goals clear of his nearest rival Milan’s Lautaro Martinez, in the league standings. His impressive performances for Napoli this season have generated much interest and he could be set for a move away this summer. According to Fichajes, Atletico Madrid are interested in signing Osimhen this summer. The report added that with Joao Felix looking increasingly likely to leave Atletico Madrid this summer, Los Rojiblancos chiefs are keen to use the funds generated for his sale to pursue the signing of Osimhen. Despite having signed Memphis Depay from Barcelona during the January transfer window, Atletico Madrid has continued to struggle for goals, and they could look to spend big on Osimhen to help correct that issue for next season. Atletico will have to battle Chelsea and Man United, who are set to bid for the attacker.
