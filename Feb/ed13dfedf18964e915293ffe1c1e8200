The Osun State government has warned that any filling station caught diverting and hoarding Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) allocated to the State will face the full wrath of the law. This warning was given by Kazeem Akinleye, the Chief of Staff to the Osun State Governor, who also doubles as the Chairman of the Petroleum Monitoring Committee of the State government on Thursday in Osogbo. According to a statement signed by Olawale Rasheed, the Spokesperson to the Osun State Governor, Akinleye disclosed that recent findings revealed that several tankers laden with PMS were allocated to Osun but these were not reflecting across the filling stations in the State. Akinleye explained that his committee had contacted the petroleum authorities at the highest level and was in possession of actual PMS allocation to the State. He also explained that the allocation included the actual list of companies and stations allocated the PMS. According to the statement, “Our Committee had contacted the top management of the NNPC Limited and we have full details of filling stations and the exact number of PMS allocated to them from January to date. There are clear evidence that some owners of filling stations are diverting allocated PMS. “We are by this statement placing on notice all owners of filling stations in Osun State that we have all the facts about allocated PMS. We will soon commence physical monitoring exercise and we will not hesitate to invoke regulatory actions on those found wanting. “To make the exercise very inclusive, His Excellency, Mr Governor has approved the expansion of the committee to include members of the civil society coalition. The committee will host its maiden meeting very soon.” He assured members of the public that the committee will expose individuals behind the current hardship they were passing through. Members of the committee are drawn from the Nigeria Police, DSS, Army, IPMAN, NLC, among others.
