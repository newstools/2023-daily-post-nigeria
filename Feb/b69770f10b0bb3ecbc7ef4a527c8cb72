Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has likened All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate Bola Tinubu to Nigeria’s founding fathers. The Ondo helmsman made the comparison on Tuesday at the launch of a book on the former Lagos governor, NAN reports. The book centred on Tinubu alongside the late Obafemi Awolowo, Nnamdi Azikiwe, Ahmadu Bello, among others. Akeredolu, represented by deputy Lucky Aiyedatiwa, described the APC co-founder as the best presidential candidate. The governor noted that the party was blessed to have a courageous leader who remains an inspiration to many people. “Tinubu has similar attributes with the late Obafemi Awolowo and other founding fathers which the book has done justice to. “Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has continued to inspire other people, both old, young and the corporate environment,” Akeredolu said. The author, Omofunmilewa Adejombo said Tinubu’s efforts in ensuring that true democracy is enthroned in Nigeria were highlighted.
