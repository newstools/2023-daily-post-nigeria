A Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mike Ozekhome, has said it is wrong for President Muhammadu Buhari to disobey the Supreme Court order on the validity of old naira notes. Recall that in an interim order, the apex court had restrained the Federal Government from implementing its February 10th deadline for stopping the circulation of old naira notes; however, in his pronouncement on Thursday, Buhari disregarded the court by extending the validity of the N200 old notes only. Reacting to Buhari’s Thursday speech, Ozekhome, in a statement on Friday, described the directive of the President on naira redesign as a ‘dicta, more in the form of a military Decree’. He added that Buhari’s action indicated that he is an emperor, overlord and supreme leader contrary to democratic traditions. Ozekhome said, “Every Nigerian had expected that the Federal Government would respect this apex court’s position. But President Buhari demurred. He made himself Supreme Leader; an Emperor; Potentate, Mikado and Overlord”.
