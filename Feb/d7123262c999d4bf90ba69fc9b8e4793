Chelsea legend, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has insisted that manager, Graham Potter is under pressure at the club after the Blues’ Premier League derby 2-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Hasselbaink said this while speaking on the chances of Chelsea sacking Potter after the latest defeat to Tottenham. “That’s a really difficult question. I don’t know,” Hasselbaink said on Sky Sports when asked if Potter could be sacked. “When you are at a big club like Chelsea, and you lose two games in a row, that’s already considered a crisis. Now, these owners have come in, they want to go in a different direction, and they want to do this project. “They have bought Potter in, he is their man, so they will give him as much time as possible. But you also have to expect something back from Potter. “And if he doesn’t [do that] then eventually that [backing] will stop. When that is, I don’t know, but Potter is under pressure, and that is what happens at big clubs,” he said.
