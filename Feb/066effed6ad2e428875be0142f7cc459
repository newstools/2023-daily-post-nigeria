The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has re-arraigned a social media influencer and comedian, Adedamola Adewale, popularly known as Adeherself, before the Lagos State High Court in Ikeja for an alleged internet fraud of N7.9 million. The Commission docked the influencer before Justice Mojisola Dada on a three-count charge of attempt to obtain money by false pretences, retention of proceeds of criminal conduct, and conspiracy to obtain money by false pretences. However, the comedian pleaded not guilty to the charge. The EFCC counsel, Samuel Daji, during the proceedings, informed the court that the defendant was first arraigned before Justice Sherifat Solebo, who had retired from the bench, and the case has now been reassigned. Daji told the court that the case was re-assigned and there was a need for a proper bail application by the defence before the defendant could be released from custody. “My lord, this case was heard before Justice Solebo Sherifat before she retired, and when it was transferred to this honourable court, I informed my learned colleague that the case would be coming up on the 25th of January. He said he thought it was the day before. “This is a matter that is starting before your lordship, and we do not know if her sureties, who stood for her earlier, are dead or alive. It is proper for the defence to apply for fresh bail before your lordship,” he said. However, Kassim Molade, the defence counsel, pleaded with the court to permit his client to continue with the bail granted by Justice Solebo, pending the time he would file a new bail application.
