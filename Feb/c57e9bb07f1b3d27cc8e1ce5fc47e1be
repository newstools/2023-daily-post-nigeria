The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Olajide Adediran a.k.a. Jandor visited Mrs. Jennifer Efidi on Sunday. The citizen was brutalized by political thugs on Saturday at a polling unit in Surulere during the presidential and national assembly elections. Jandor condemned the violence witnessed in some areas, noting that it was one of the reasons his party is seeking the ouster of the All Progressives Congress, APC. The flagbearer said months after the PDP first raised alarm about election related violence, Jennifer became “a victim of the ruling party’s wickedness”. “I visited her today to applaud her bravery and resilience to exercise her franchise in order to unseat the present wickedness called government,” he noted. Jandor advised Nigerians to draw hope from Jennifer’s bravery and defend their votes now and during the governorship elections on March 11. Nigerians are calling the woman a hero after going back to her unit to cast her vote despite receiving stitches for a head injury.
