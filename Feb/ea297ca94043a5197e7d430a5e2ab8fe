Less than 14 days to the February 2023 presidential election, the flagbearer of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu has met with the Labour Party Gubernatorial candidate in Kano State, Bashir Ishaq. Details of the meeting held in Abuja on Sunday evening are still sketchy as at press time. However, sources said the development followed a move by the ruling party to woo Bashir into the APC. The pictures of Tinubu’s meeting with some Labour Party leaders in the State have set tongues wagging since Sunday night. Recall that some key stakeholders of the Labour Party last month shunned its presidential candidate, Peter Obi during his campaign rally in Kano. Among those who shunned Obi’s rally were LP Presidential Campaign Council director, Mohammed Zarewa, State coordinator of Peter Obi’s campaign, Balarabe Wakili and Idris Dambazau, a member of the presidential campaign council.
