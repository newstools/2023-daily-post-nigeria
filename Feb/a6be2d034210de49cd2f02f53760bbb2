The Lagos State Government has refuted reports that the Blue Line Rail went up in flames on Tuesday. News websites and social media blogs published the story earlier in the day but most have deleted it. DAILY POST reports that the publications caused anxiety among residents who fear the fire might have been a sabotage. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s aide on new media, Jubril Gawat made a clarification on Twitter this evening. The official explained it was a diesel truck that caught fire near the Blue Line Rail. “Our men of the Lagos Fire Service @LagosRescue & others contained it properly. “Fire cleared up since 1:30 pm today. No casualty. Rail Line not affected,” Gawat tweeted. The Senior Special Assistant posted a video of Fire Service officers putting off the inferno.
