Barcelona legend, Gerard Pique, has claimed that his former partner Shakira’s phone number is the most famous contact on his phone. Pique said that Shakira has the most followers on Instagram based on his phone list. The Spaniard and Shakira confirmed their break up last year following a 12-year relationship that produced two kids Milan, 9, and Sasha, 7. They met in 2010 while filming the music video for her World Cup song Waka Waka (This Time for Africa). In an interview with John Nellis, Pique was asked to name the most famous person on his contact list. The former Manchester United defender said, “Maybe… I would say… Shakira. She was my partner, [so] it could be her. I’m thinking [about the number of] followers [on] Instagram… If she is someone other than football related. If it is about football, Cristiano, [as] he is the most followed in the world.”
