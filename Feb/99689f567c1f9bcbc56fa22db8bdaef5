Ahead of the 2023 general elections starting next Saturday, PRNigeria has presented a security report on some presidential candidates. The findings show that five flagbearers have staunch followers who must be monitored before and after the polls scheduled for February 25. The candidates include a former Vice President, three former governors and a good governance activist-cum-publisher. They are Bola Tinubu of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC; Atiku Abubakar, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP; Peter Obi, Labour Party, LP. Others include Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigerian Peoples Party, NNPP, and Omoyele Sowore of the African Democratic Congress, ADC. The survey titled, “2023 Elections: SWOT Analysis of Major Presidential Candidates and Security Matters”, was unveiled in Abuja on Wednesday. The research also identified states where political violence may erupt if proactive measures are not taken by security agencies and other relevant stakeholders. They are Rivers, Delta (South-South); Enugu, Imo (South-East); Lagos, Oyo (South-West); Kano, Kebbi (Northwest); Borno, Gombe (North-East), and Kwara, Niger (North Central) The report commended security agencies for choosing to remain neutral, fair, and apolitical in the build-up to the decisive and keenly-followed polls. Citizens in states covered, including those who have their Permanent Voter’s Cards, PVCs, were interviewed on their hopes, expectations, and security concerns. “This was with a view to draw the attention of the security agencies, in particular, to the places we have identified as flashpoints prior, during, and even after the elections,” said Abdulsalam Mahmud, PRNigeria Deputy Editor.
