A Federal High Court in Abuja has extended the order restraining the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, from suspending or expelling Gov. Nyesom Wike of Rivers from the party. Justice James Omotosho gave the directive on Tuesday after the counsel to the governor, Dr Joshua Musa, SAN, and lawyer to the PDP and others, Johnson Usman, SAN, agreed on March 6 to argue their case. Justice Omotosho had, on February 2, given a restraining order against the party and others listed in the face of Wike’s motion dated February 2. Others joined in the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/139/2023 include its National Working Committee, NWC, and National Executive Committee, NEC, National Chairman of PDP, Dr Iyorchia Ayu. The governor is praying for an order directing all parties to maintain the status quo and stay all actions in the matter relating to the threat to suspend or expel him from the party. Wike also asked for an order of the court granting him leave to serve the motion on notice, originating motion and all other processes of the court in the suit on the 1st to 5th respondents by substituted means by pasting all the said processes at the PDP National Secretariat. After hearing Wike’s lawyer, Dr J. Y. Musa, SAN, Justice Omotosho granted all the reliefs sought. “That leave is hereby granted to the applicant (Wike) to serve the originating motion, motion on notice and all other processes of this court in this suit on the 1st to 5th respondents by substituted means to wit, by pasting all the said processes of court on PDP National Secretariat, Wadata Plaza, Wuse Zone 5, Federal Capital Territory, Abuja,” he said.
