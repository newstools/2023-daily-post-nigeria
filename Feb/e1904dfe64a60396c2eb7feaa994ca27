Former Aston Villa captain, Gabriel Agbonlahor, has urged Chelsea to replace attacker Kai Havertz with a player like Tottenham’s Harry Kane or Manchester City’s Erling Haaland. Agbonlahor insisted that Havertz is ‘lightweight’, adding that the Germany international gets bullied on the ball. Havertz has registered just six goals in 29 games across all competitions for Chelsea so far this season. The 23-year-old has mainly operated as a centre-forward this far this season for Graham Potter’s side, especially in recent months. But Agbonlahor has not been impressed with Havertz’s display for Chelsea, saying he is more of a number 10. “[Chelsea are] missing a ruthless striker,” Agbonlahor told talkSPORT. “Put Harry Kane in that team, put Haaland in that team, imagine the chances they would score. “Havertz, for me, is lightweight. He’s a big lad but gets bullied on the ball. He is not an out-and-out number nine and is more a number 10. “But] they have got [Cristopher] Nkunku coming in the summer.”
