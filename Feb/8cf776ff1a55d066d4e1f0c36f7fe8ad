Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State on Monday urged the people of the state to remain calm, eschew violence and go about their businesses without any fear of harassment. Sanwo-Olu, in a statement via his Twitter handle, said that there had been reports of friction in some parts of the state in the morning. According to the governor, there is no need for violence, which is not part of the state’s culture. The statement reads in part: “I urge all Lagosians to go about their businesses without any fear of harassment. “Law enforcement agencies have been asked to ensure that there is no breakdown of law and order in any part of the state. “Let us remain calm. All will be well. We’re a peaceful people, and so we shall remain.”
