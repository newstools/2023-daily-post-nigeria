Unknown gunmen have again attacked the residence of the spokesperson of the Coalition of United Political Parties, CUPP, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere in Imo State. DAILY POST reports that the development is coming barely three weeks after Ugochinyere’s house in Akokwa was attacked by armed men who gunned down four persons including his uncle. Recall that the gunmen had on January 14, attacked Ugochinyere’s private residence, burnt down the building and cars, murdered his uncle and three others. Ugochinyere confirmed the latest attack via an SoS message sent out on the WhatsApp platform, calling for help on Tuesday. Efforts by our correspondent to reach the Imo State Police Command proved abortive as the command’s spokesperson, Michael Abattam failed to pick his calls.
