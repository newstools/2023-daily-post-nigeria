President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed grief over the destruction caused by the early morning fire at the popular Maiduguri Monday Market on Sunday. In a statement by his Spokesman, Malam Garba Shehu, in Abuja on Sunday, Buhari called for vigilance as winds and rising temperatures increase the risks of fires in forests, homes, public buildings and markets. He said, ”the nation’s prayers and condolences are with the hardworking traders and their families who have reportedly saved very little or nothing from the fire.” Buhari commended the immediate response of Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno to the incident and directed effective coordination and collaboration between federal and state agencies to bring needed relief to those who are affected. The president urged the state and federal agencies responsible for fire management to strive towards higher levels of preparedness, mitigation efforts and strengthening their response mechanisms. This, he said, would help in dealing with the increasing menace of the market and other fire disasters.
