The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has arrested Chidozie Kingsley Nwachi for allegedly defrauding an American, Nicole Kierulff Sayers, after false marriage. Nwachi was nabbed in Abuja on Wednesday after Sayers alleged that the suspect lured her into a false marriage and defrauded her of $200,000 savings. A statement by the EFCC said Nwachi’s ploy was the offer of a phony contract by the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, Abuja. The suspect allegedly made Sayers finance the execution of the contract until the petitioner contacted the Ministry with the contract papers discovered to be fake. “I was accustomed to transferring money to him. I had just married him, even though I did not feel confident in my choice to have married him,” the EFCC quoted her saying. Sayers revealed she has been suicidal on and off after discovering the suspect scammed her. Items recovered from Nwachi include Toyota Venza and Lexus ES300, expensive wristwatches, two Apple iPhones, two iPhone laptops, an international passport and ATM cards. The sum of $2204 was also recovered from him. Nwachi would be charged to court as soon as investigations are concluded.
