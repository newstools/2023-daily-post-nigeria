Chelsea legend, John Obi Mikel has revealed how Jose Mourinho converted him to a defensive midfielder. Mikel played under Mourinho during their time together at Chelsea. The former Super Eagles captain usually played as a number 10 for Nigeria’s national team and Lyn Oslo. However, Mourinho, who is now the manager of AS Roma, converted Obi Mikel into a defensive midfielder at Chelsea. Speaking with Dubai Eye 103.8, Mikel said: “It was Jose, I know that you played as a number 10 in the national team, in Lyn Oslo. “You are very good on the ball, you don’t give the ball away, physically, you are very strong, but I don’t see you playing up the pitch. I think you can take over from Claude Makelele. “Because Cluad Makelele was also leaving then, it was his last season, and I was just coming in, he said stay here and take over his position. He is going to leave, so I want you to take over his position.”
