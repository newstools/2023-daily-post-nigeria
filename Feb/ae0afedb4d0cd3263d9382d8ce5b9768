The Senior Pastor of Dunamis International Gospel Center, Pastor Paul Enenche has expressed anger over the decision by some agitators in the Southeast to enforce sit-at-home on election day. Recall that Simon Ekpa, the self-acclaimed disciple of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu had vowed that there would be no election in the Southeast. Ekpa who is currently being investigated by the Finland government had vowed to ensure that sit-at-home is enforced across the region on Saturday to stop the presidential election. Angered by the development, Enenche in a video broadcast recorded ahead of the election, wondered why the agitators who had complained of being marginalized would work against the candidacy of a son of their own soil. The Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi who is one of the major contenders for the nation’s top job, hails from Southeast, Anambra State precisely. Enenche who had declared support for Obi urged the agitators to remain calm and allow the election to be conducted without violence. He said, “This goes to the youths and agitators in the Southeast. What mentality is this? The whole world is advertising the son of your soil to become the next president of Nigeria and you are busy antagonizing and attempting to frustrate the voting process in your region. “You have cried of marginalization in Nigeria and the opportunity is being presented for that to be addressed through a Nigerian president from the Southeast or an Igbo man and you are resisting it. “If the devil is against you, you are also against yourselves. Who bewitched you? Are you paid to cause destruction and frustration for your people in the name of agitation? Those driving you, don’t love your people. “Don’t waste your life and don’t waste your future for nothing. Calm down. Peace be still in the Southeast”.
