The All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on Tuesday drew the curtain on his campaign rally in Lagos State, with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo not attending any of them. DAILY POST observed that Osinbajo did not attend any of Tinubu’s presidential campaign rallies across the country. This might not be unconnected to their differences prior to the APC presidential primaries in 2022. Osinbajo had endured a frosty relationship with Tinubu during the APC presidential primaries in 2022, as followers of the latter believed that the Vice President should have backed his political godfather. During the APC primaries, some staunch supporters of Tinubu had tagged Osinbajo a traitor, a betrayer and Judas, for daring to stand against the former Governor of Lagos State. One of such supporters, Joe Igbokwe, the Special Adviser for Drainage and Water Resources to Governor Babajide Sanwo- Olu, subscribed to the notion of Osinbajo being a betrayer. The Vice President, who hails from Ogun State, had worked as the Attorney General of Lagos State while Tinubu was governor. Amid the alleged frosty relationship with Osinbajo, Tinubu has visited almost all the states of the country for his presidential campaign rallies. Commenting on Osinbajo’s absence, the spokesman of the Tinubu/Shettima campaign, Festus Keyamo, said the Vice President’s absence was due to Buhari’s directive. Speaking with DAILY POST, Keyamo recalled issuing a statement where Buhari directed Osinbajo and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF, Boss Mustapha, to stay off APC presidential campaigns. According to Keyamo: “There was an official statement where the president directed Osinbajo and Boss Mustapha to stay off the campaign and work while he campaigned for APC. “We issued a statement to this effect last year.”
