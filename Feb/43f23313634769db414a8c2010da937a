The Federal High Court, FHC, in Abuja has refused to grant an application filed by Pastor Umo Eno and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Eno and his platform are seeking an order to set aside the judgement which declared Hon. Michael Enyong as the authentic governorship candidate in Akwa Ibom. During the primaries in May 2022, Eno polled 993 votes out of the 1018 accredited delegates, defeating over 10 other contestants. At the election held at Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo, Aniekan Etim scored 2 votes while Enyong had 1 vote. On January 20, a Federal High Court in Abuja sacked Eno, former Commissioner for Lands and Water resources, as the party’s governorship candidate. Delivering judgment in the suit FHC/ABJ/CS/1295/2022, Justice Fadima Aminu ordered the PDP to submit Enyong’s name to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as its flagbearer. Though Eno and the PDP approached the Court of Appeal to reverse the ruling, they filed a separate application at the FHC seeking an order for stay of execution. At the resumed hearing Friday, the court declined to entertain the application and adjourned till March 15. All parties were directed to argue their case at the Court of Appeal since suits have already been filed and are pending before the appellate court. Enyong is currently the member representing Uyo, Uruan, Nsit Atai, and Ibesikpo Asutan at the House of Representatives. The lawmaker maintains he is the PDP governorship candidate for the March 11 election, despite the National Working Committee, NWC, backing Umo. The Christian leader and entrepreneur is the preferred successor of Governor Udom Emmanuel, Chairman of PDP Campaign Council, PCC, for presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar.
