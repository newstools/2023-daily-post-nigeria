The Lagos State Magistrates Court has remanded popular celebrity car dealer Ikechukwu Ogbona, a.k.a IVD, over the death of his wife, Bimbo Ogbonna. In the verdict by presiding Magistrate Adebayo Kafayat, the decision was made following the advice of the State Director of Public Prosecution, DPP, which indicted Ogbonna for involuntary manslaughter. Reading out the DPPâ€™s advice, Adebayo said the defendant should be arraigned before the High Court. Therefore, the court remanded Ikechukwu in custody pending the filing of information against him. The defence counsel, Abubakar Yesufu, prayed the court to release IVD based on earlier bail conditions granted to him. But the Magistrate held that she lacked the jurisdiction in case of involuntary manslaughter. Hence all bail applications should be presented before the high court. She, however, adjourned the case till the 7th of March 2023. Recall that Bimbo died on the 15th of October 2022, following an injury sustained from a fire incident that occurred as a result of violence in their home in Megamound Estate.
