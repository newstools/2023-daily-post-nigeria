The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Resident Electoral Commissioner for Osun State, Dr Mutiu Agboke has issued a strong warning to suspected saboteurs as the 2023 general elections approach. Agboke gave this warning while receiving the Network of Youth-led NGOs in his Office in Osun.  Agboke said, “I have informed whoever cares to listen, don’t take the INEC job if you have any plan that negates the ethics and conducts worthy of our job, no one will be spared if found wanting. ”We will make sure we train and if possible re-train the ad-hoc staff but they must also comply with simple instructions, no one should be given a ballot paper without being accredited by the BVAS. Anyone who allowed himself to be used such that the BVAS is bypassed will face the wrath of the law. “The youths must own the process because they are pivotal to the success of the 2023 general elections. Agboke who noted that there is no criminal minded-individual that is not known to community members called on members of the public to do all it takes to stop anyone willing to disrupt the election process in their various polling units. While responding to concerns raised on the issue of Naira scarcity, he noted that though INEC staff and officials cannot be isolated from the challenge, it will not deter the smooth running of the process as they were in tandem with relevant stakeholders such as CBN to deliver free, fair and credible election results. The Osun INEC boss also urged the network to help in disseminating the information to relevant quarters. Agboke also made it clear that BVAS is the best device used by the INEC in recent times for voter accreditation and that its integrity is not in doubt. He, however, warned strongly that no INEC or Ad-hoc staff should jeopardize their destiny on a platter of any form of gratification because anyone caught should be ready to go to jail.
