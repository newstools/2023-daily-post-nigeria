Mozambique head coach, Dario Monteiro says his side must believe they can beat the Flying Eagles in their final group game at the 2023 Africa U-20 Cup of Nations. The Young Os Mambas are winless in the competition after recording a draw and defeat from their opening two games. The South Africans will need to beat the Flying Eagles to be sure of a place in the quarter-finals. Monteiro reckoned that beating the seven-time U-20 Afcon title holder will be an herculean task but they will give their best. “We need a win and we will try our best to get it,” Monteiro told journalists. “We know that it’s a complicated match and it’s not easy to play against Nigeria they’re strong but we will try our best. We had two strong matches and two strong teams.”
