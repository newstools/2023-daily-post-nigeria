The All Progressives Congress, APC, in Akwa Ibom has asked Governor Udom Emmanuel to account for the billions refunded by the Buhari administration. The party asked the government to atone the state over alleged financial recklessness and plundering of resources. A statement on Saturday by APC Chairman, Stephen Ntukekpo accused authorities of trying to twist the comments of its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. Information Commissioner in Akwa Ibom, Ini Ememobong had alleged that Tinubu called Emmanuel “a boy” and condemned the aspirant’s “unwarranted and uncharitable” attack on Udom at a rally in Uyo. The government demanded that the former Lagos governor tender a public apology to the Akwa Ibom helmsman and the people. On Thursday, a group issued a seven-day ultimatum to the APC co-founder to apologize to the governor or face legal action. Reacting, however, Ntukekpo noted that Tinubu actually exposed Emmanuel’s “financial mismanagement and Lilliputian performance”. The politician accused the administration of “mindless looting and brazen embezzlement of pensions, gratuities and other entitlements”. Ntukekpo said the situation has plunged the people into poverty and deprivation for nearly eight years of the Peoples Democratic Party leadership. “Only recently, we were made to understand that payments in excess of N600 billion, being refunds from the APC-led Federal Government, were made from the federation account to Akwa Ibom State.” The APC told the public that to date, the Emmanuel-led administration has been unable to satisfactorily explain how the funds were used. The statement further alleged the governor was “plotting to foist a stooge as his successor to cover his tracks”. Ntukekpo declared the “machinations of the PDP” had failed as Akwa Ibom people “are resolute” to vote for the APC and its candidate, Akanimo Udofia.
