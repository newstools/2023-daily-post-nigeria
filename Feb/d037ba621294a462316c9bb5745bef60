The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential campaign council in Rivers State has cancelled its planned rally in the state. The chairperson of the PDP presidential campaign council, Lee Maeba, announced this on Monday during a media briefing in Port Harcourt, the state capital. The rally was scheduled for Tuesday. Maeba explained that the rally was called off following attacks on its members. “It is, therefore, instructive to note that this directive has direction in the vituperation of an overt act of Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike,” Maeba said. According to him, Wike openly branded supporters of the presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar as “enemies of the state and vowed to crush them.” He noted that cancelling the event was the best decision, so they don’t lose lives “on the insistence of hosting a rally due to the brigandage which the security agencies have not been able to break in and restore confidence, security-wise, on the populace and our members.”
