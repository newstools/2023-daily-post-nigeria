Manchester United boss, Erik ten Hag has hit out at Reading’s Andy Carroll for the tackle which injured Christian Eriksen. Eriksen will miss at least three months of action with an ankle injury. The Denmark midfielder suffered the injury after a nasty tackle from Carroll during United’s 3-1 victory over Reading in the fourth round of the FA Cup last Saturday. Carroll was not booked for the tackle but was later sent off after picking up yellow cards for two other late challenges. “I think football has to set limits, restrictions, that protect the players. “This is a tackle, and the two tackles after it, that don’t belong on a pitch, because there is a high risk of injuring your colleague. So it’s worse and I’m left wondering about that,” Ten Hag told a news conference on Tuesday.
