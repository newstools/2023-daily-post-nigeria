The PDP guber candidate made this known at the flag-off of the party’s rally at Ameka, Ezza South Local Government Area of the State. He added that he would make industrialization of the State one of the major objectives of his government. According to him: “I will give empowerment to the youth, bring transformation to the civil servants, pay your pensions and gratuities, pay your salaries as at when due, give scholarships to deserving students and empowerment to all and sundry. “We’ll industrialize Ebonyi State, so that there will be jobs for the youths. Under our watch, we will remove every Ebonyian from every street they are hawking across the country.” He described the people of Ezza clan as forthright and dependable allies at all times, urging them to vote the PDP across board as his government will always carry them along in the scheme of things.
