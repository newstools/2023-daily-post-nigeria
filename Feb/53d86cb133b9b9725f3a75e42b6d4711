As Nigerians continue to bear the brunt of the scarcity of new Naira notes, Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, has directed the state-owned microfinance bank to open its branches in all 17 local government areas of the state. Buni gave the directive in a statement on Saturday through his media aide, Mamman Mohammed, noting that the move is part of measures to ease the sufferings of rural dwellers by providing banking services to their doorstep. Buni stressed that the lack of banks in most parts of the state had become a problem of grave concern. Hence government must provide solutions to people. “The new cashless policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria came with lots of challenges to our people in most parts of the state due to the lack of banks. “Most local government areas do not have financial institutions and have to travel far distances with heavy risks to conduct financial transactions”, Gov. Buni said According to him, the situation is further compounded with the new cashless policy, and despite the government’s plea to the commercial banks to open branches, there have been no responses. The governor then charged the management of the bank to prepare for the challenges that would come with the new branches while expressing the commitment of his administration to support the growth of the bank. Governor Buni also urged the business community, civil servants and everyone in the localities to patronize the bank.
