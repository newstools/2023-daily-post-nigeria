The lawmaker representing the Abi/Yakurr federal constituency of Cross River State, Alex Egbonna has said the introduction of the BVAS machines tremendously helped to curtail electoral excesses usually witnessed during previous general elections. In an interview, he said the new technology is an innovation worth modifying to completely eradicate rigging and such other vices which politicians thrived on for selfish purposes. Though there were cases where the BVAS did not work or were slow, Egbonna commended INEC and the large turnout of voters. He said the presidential and national assembly elections were very successful with insignificant drawbacks. “Some BVAS machines were slow or malfunctioned at some polling units in Cross River State. That notwithstanding, the new technology should be sustained and improved upon for subsequent elections because it is far better. “Overall, I can confirm that the election was very peaceful in most parts of my constituency and in the state generally”. Speaking about returning officers, he called on INEC to afford them some logistics comforts instead of subjecting them to stress and susceptibility. “INEC should provide good logistics, including vehicles for the returning officers instead of allowing them to queue commercial vehicles to convey them to electoral venues. “Let me also remark on the poor quality of the INEC tags. They are of inferior quality. A party should be allowed to print the tags itself.” Egbonna, a one-time chief of staff to former Governor, Liyel Imoke said the federal government currency swap policy which affected cash circulation, disallowed much money influence on the electorate. He, however, declared that the cashless policy was not quite a good policy. “NigerIa’s problem is policy formulation. This cash squeeze policy won’t work”, he stressed.
