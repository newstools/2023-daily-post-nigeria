Less than four days to the February general election, some yet-to-be-identified gunmen have attacked and blown off the administrative offices of the Okehi Local Government Area of Kogi State. DAILY POST gathered that the incident occurred on Monday night when the assailants invaded the area with some explosives. When contacted by DAILY POST, the Kogi State Police Public Relations Officer, William Ovye Aya, confirmed the incident. According to him, the command had commenced an investigation to unravel the cause of the attack. Recall that the Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, the Islamic State West Africa Province, ISWAP, had claimed responsibility for a car bomb explosion that killed about four people and injured several others in the Okene Local Government Area of Kogi State in January.
