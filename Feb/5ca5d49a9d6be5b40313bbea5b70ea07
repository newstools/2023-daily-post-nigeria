There is a heavy security presence at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Abeokuta Branch. Policemen in the early hours of Monday, deployed operatives to the Apex bank branch at Okelewo, Abeokuta to avert possible attacks by criminal elements. It was gathered that there was an intelligence report that some individuals might attack the bank over their inability to access the newly redesigned naira notes. Our correspondent reports that armed policemen were positioned at strategic locations to prevent any breakdown of law and order. Also, some commercial banks in Abeokuta restricted access to their premises over the fear of being attacked by angry customers. In most banks, customers are only allowed to use Automated Teller Machines (ATM) instead of going into the banking halls. It was reported that similar attacks were recorded in other parts of the country last week. Meanwhile, customers are still in queues waiting to withdraw money from ATMs. DAILY POST reports that the scarcity of the new naira notes is still biting hard in Ogun State, affecting businesses and other activities.
