The Obi-Datti Campaign of the Labour Party (LP), has blamed the absence of Peter Obi, its presidential flagbearer, at the presidential debate on aircraft technical issues. Diran Onifade, Head of Media, Obi-Datti Campaign Council, disclosed this in a statement on Sunday while explaining Obi’s absence at the presidential debate organised by the Nigerian Elections Debate Group (NEDG) in Abuja. The statement reads in part: “The Obi-Datti Campaign hereby states that our candidate, Mr Peter Obi, was unable to attend the debate programme following the advice of the technical crew of the aircraft he was travelling in. “After an engagement in Akure, Ondo State, he meant to head for Abuja for the debate but was advised otherwise due to technical issues with the aircraft, which made the pilot decide to head for Lagos instead.” Meanwhile, Labour Party faithful including senior members of the campaign had gathered at the International Conference Centre, Abuja, the venue of the debate programme ahead of Obi’s arrival. The senior members include the Director General of the campaign, Balogun Akin Osuntokun and the campaign manager, Ambassador Oseloka Obaze. Others are Labour Party functionaries including Mrs Esther Nenadi Usman and Alhaji Audi Mohammed.
