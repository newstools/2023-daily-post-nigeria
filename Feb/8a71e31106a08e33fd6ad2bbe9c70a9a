Golden Eaglets head coach, Nduka Ugbade says his team is battle ready for their group opponents at the 2023 Africa U-17 Cup of Nations. The Eaglets will face Morocco, South Africa and Zambia in Group B following the draw for the biennial competition on Wednesday. Ugbade’s side will head into the competition as the WAFU B U-17 champions and Ugbade is confident they can replicate their performance in Ghana last year against the rest of Africa. “We shall approach every game with the seriousness it deserves, that is to win every game,” told reporters at the team’s training base in Abuja. “That is the mentality we take to the tournament. We know our opponents are tough and good at this level, but we shall try to outplay and overcome them.” Algeria will host the 2023 U-17 AFCON from April 29 to May 19. The four semi-finalists in the competition will represent Africa at the World Cup in Peru later in the year. The Golden Eaglets started their preparation for the competition last week in Abuja. They have already won two friendlies against Ikon Allah Boys and Prosper Academy.
