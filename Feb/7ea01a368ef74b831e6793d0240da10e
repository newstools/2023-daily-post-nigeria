A factional governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State, Segun Showunmi has warned members of the party not to engage in any form of rigging during the 2023 general elections. Showunmi advised that all laws guiding the 2023 general elections must be strictly adhered to for a free and fair contest. He spoke Wednesday at a workshop organised for all PDP ward mobilisers and collation agents in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. Showunmi told the PDP members that the new electoral act would not give room for over voting in the coming elections, adding that “any polling units that witnessed over voting would be cancelled by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).” “This new electoral act is not giving room for over voting. Ensure there is no over voting in your polling units. No one has sent you to manipulate votes. “You need honesty to manage your polling units. Your duty is to beg people and mobilise people for votes in your areas. No rigging please!” he warned. The political leader commended President Muhammadu Buhari for giving the electorate the assurances that their votes would count through the passage of the amended electoral act. Speaking on the PDP in Ogun State, the party chieftain said, “PDP has never lost to opposition in Ogun, we have been losing to ourselves. Selfish interest by some set of people has affected the progress of the party in the State.” Showunmi, while saying his governorship case before the Supreme court is delicate and sensitive, expressed optimism that he would win.
