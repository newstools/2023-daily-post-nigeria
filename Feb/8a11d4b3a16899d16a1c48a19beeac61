A fuel tanker exploded on Saturday evening at a filling station in Ilorin, Kwara State, while discharging petrol, causing a major fire disaster. The incident occurred at about 2205hrs at M.M Rodiat Nigeria Ltd filling station along Sobi Specialist Hospital Road-Ayegbami junction in Ilorin East Local Government Area of the state. Although no life was lost in the fire disaster, it, however, destroyed property worth over N50 million. The Special Adviser on Strategy to the governor, Saadu Salahu, whose private residence is located behind the burning fuel station, noted that but for the prompt intervention of the government, neighbours, gallant firefighters and security agencies, the fire incident would have wreaked havoc of unimaginable proportion in the area. Governor Abdul Rahman Abdulrazaq later visited the scene of the fire disaster at about 11:45 pm for an on-the-spot-assessment of the situation. He commiserated with victims and residents of the area. Spokesman of the state fire service, Hassan Adekunle, said in Ilorin on Sunday that at about 08:05 pm, men of the Kwara State Fire Service were summoned to a fire incident by Mr Kamaldeen. “On the Brigade’s arrival at the scene of occurrence, the blazing fire had engulfed the whole tanker due to the terrible nature of the incident. “However, firemen were able to put out the fire on time and prevent the burning tanker from affecting the filling stations and building in the vicinity. “Most importantly, no life was lost in the accident,” the spokesman added. He said a “report says, the accident was caused due to the mechanical problem in the petrol tanker.” The Director of Kwara State Fire Service, Prince Falade John Olumuyiwa, urged the general public to be more careful and advised the filling stations to procure all the necessary safety equipment at their various stations.
