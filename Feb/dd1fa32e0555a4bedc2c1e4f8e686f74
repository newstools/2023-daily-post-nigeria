The Kwara State Police Commissioner, Paul Odama, on Saturday, ordered aggressive patrols of banks and financial facilities across the 16 local government areas of the state. The order followed intelligence report received by the state police command to the effect that hoodlums have perfected plans to replicate the lawlessness unleashed on some banks in some states as a result of the ongoing currency swap. The command, through its spokesman, Okasanmi Ajayi, in a statement in Ilorin on Saturday assured the people of the state that the command would deal ruthlessly with any law breaker. The spokesman advised criminals to shelve any dastardly ideas and change their mind as anyone arrested would be met with heavy consequences. Meanwhile, Governor Abdulrahaman Abdulrazaq has called for more supply of the new naira notes to the citizens to ease things for the masses and stabilize the currency swap. He also called for calm while all stakeholders work to ease the situation on the ongoing currency swap from old to new naira notes. Governor Abdulrazaq made the appeal during a courtesy visit at the Government House by the CBN Consumer Protection Department in Ilorin, led by Mrs Rashidat Jumoke Monguno. Governor Abdulrazaq said the government will continue to engage the citizens, traditional institutions, students and all segments of the society to pass the message through for calmness and to make sure the process is seamless.
