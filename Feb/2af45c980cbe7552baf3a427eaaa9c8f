Despite claims by the Nigeria National Petroleum Company Limited, NNPCL, of supplying over 450 million litres of petrol between January 28 to February 3, 2023, the scarcity of the product has continued to persist, especially in Kano. A check showed that Kano receives a meagre supply of only 26 trucks of fuel rather than the 500 trucks daily that serve the ancient city. Our Correspondent who went round fuel stations observed that each station sells at a price different from others While some sold the product for N375 per litre, others sell at an even more expensive cost of N400 per litre. The Secretary of the State Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, IPMAN, Bashir Salisu Tahir, confirmed to our reporter that the state only receives 26 trucks instead of the 500 that Kano city alone consumes. He said the supply is far less than what is required to free Kano from fuel scarcity, explaining that members of IPMAN were going the extra mile to bring in the commodity to help residents. Bashir Tahir hinted that the association have asked members to adhere strictly to the official price of the product which he said has also risen from N145 per litre to N220-210 and even N230. “There is no way we can fully supply Kano with this high shortage of over 400 trucks requirements, however, we are doing our best to ensure that even at the high price, filling stations don’t permanently lock down”, Bashir added. On the enforcement of fuel supply to Kano, the Head, Down Stream, Main Stream Regulatory Agency zonal office, Aliyu Sama said the body was doing its best to ensure that any fuel station that appears on the NNPC manifest receives the product and dispenses same. Sama said they were always out to ensure that filling stations des not hoard the commodity and that anyone found wanting would be punished according to the law.
