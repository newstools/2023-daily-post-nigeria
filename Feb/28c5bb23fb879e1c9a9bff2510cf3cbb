Founder of Christian Central Church International and National Publicity Secretary of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, PFN, Bishop Gospel Emmah Isong has called on the presidential candidates who will lose tomorrow’s election to accept their defeats in the spirit of sportsmanship. He called them to borrow from the wisdom of former president, Dr Goodluck Jonathan, who accepted defeat and congratulated Muhammadu Buhari who was eventually declared winner in the 2019 election. He spoke in an interview in Calabar, saying doing so will avert any forms of ensuing commotions and possible destabilisation of the sociopolitical system. “Don’t mobilise thugs against anyone. Nigerians are not ready to witness violence of any form; accept defeat once you have been defeated at the polls,” he stated. The cleric urged the nation’s security agencies not to allow the election to be marred by violence. He advised the electoral umpire not to compromise the franchise of the electorate. “Don’t collect money from politicians. You should be truly independent. All these are some of the things that contribute to violence,” he stated.
