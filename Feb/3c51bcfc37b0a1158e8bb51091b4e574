Following the widespread violence and irregularities that marred the February 25 presidential election, famous Nigerian actress and presenter Iretiola Olusola Doyle has described the political structure claimed by the All Progressives Congress, APC, as theft. The actress, in a tweet on her Twitter handle, stated that the “structure” which most political parties boast of is nothing more than political theft and violence. “So, this famous structure is not any real ideology or system. Nothing but political theft and violence in its most base forms? All that “intellectual” posturing over the last year was just posturing?” Also, Ireti said that she would be embarrassed if she was in that position.
