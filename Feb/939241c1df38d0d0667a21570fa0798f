Twenty months after the murder of Pa Joseph Ayonmike and his wife Shirley Ayonmike in Warri, Delta State, members of his family have appealed for help in tracking the alleged prime suspect by offering a two million naira bounty for the capture of Chukwunonso Nwogu, who at the time was the couple’s driver. The police in 2021 had declared Nwogu wanted in connection with the murder but months after the case hit a dead-end. The Ayonmike family have taken a step toward reviving the case by calling for information that could lead to the arrest of the suspect with the public notice offering the bounty and imploring those with useful information to reach the family through 0807-154-8887 and 0803-830-0921 or contact the Nigeria police. The late octogenarian and his wife were shot, stabbed and macheted by unknown assailants at their residence on N0 28 Mabiaku Road, Nana College Road, GRA, Warri. The family’s driver, Chukwunonso Nwogu (Nonso) alias Drey, Kelly, Derek, became the prime suspect after he vanished in the wake of the attack and has remained elusive despite police’s manhunt. The suspect has been described as a fugitive that moved around incognito frequently alternating his appearance from casual dress to formal and at times in traditional northern garment of Babariga. He is further believed to be hiding around the South East states, Rivers, Delta and Lagos. A family source told DAILY POST the cash reward was not a stunt but a genuine promise made in good faith. The late Pa Joseph Ayonmike, an 83-year-old man, and his wife, Dr Chinyere Shirley Ayonmike, opera soloist/duetist, Technical Vocational Education and Training, TVET, expert and a senior lecturer at the Delta State University, were murdered on Friday, June 25, 2021.
