Chelsea’s most expensive signing, Enzo Fernandez, has made three promises to the club. Fernandez said he would always try to have confidence in Chelsea, to win everything possible and keep evolving as a player at Stamford Bridge. According to the midfielder, clinching titles is the main objective for him at Chelsea, as well as enjoying football, insisting that never in his life he had felt any kind of pressure on his shoulders. The Argentina World Cup winner recently joined Chelsea from Benfica for €120million during the January transfer window. “I try to enjoy these moments and football, as that is what I am passionate about,” Fernandez told the club’s website. “I have never felt any kind of pressure on my shoulders. Never in my life. “I have always longed to play in the Premier League. Chelsea FC has given me the opportunity to play here, and I feel grateful for their trust. Honestly, ever since I landed here, I felt at home. “The World Cup is like reaching the sky! For me, that is everlasting glory. But one needs to keep the focus and self-belief. “I will always try to have confidence in us, to win everything possible and keep evolving as a player. Clinching titles is the main objective, as well as enjoying football.”
