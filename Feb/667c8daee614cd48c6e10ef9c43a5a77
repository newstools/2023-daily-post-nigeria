Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State has urged Nigerians to enthrone visionary and honest leaders to address Nigeria’s problems, including insecurity and corruption, ahead of the 2023 election. Uzodinma stated this in a lecture delivered at the National Defence College (NDC) with the theme “National Security, Strategic Leadership and Development: My Political Experience” on Friday in Abuja. He said, “The trouble with Nigeria is leadership. In less than two weeks, Nigerians will have the opportunity to make the choice of who’ll deepen the visionary strides we’ve seen in the last seven and half years as has been provided by President Muhammadu Buhari.” He added, “What Nigeria needs is that strategic leader who’s honest, accountable, knowledgeable and visionary, with uncommon patriotism and love of country. “The presence of these attributes in a leader will dismantle the roadblocks of ethnicity, religious bigotry and corruption.” DAILY POST reports that the 2023 general election is just less than ten days. The presidential candidates for Nigeria’s general elections in 2023 include Asiwaju Bola Tinubu of All Progressives Congress (APC); Alhaji Atiku Abubakar of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); Peter Obi of Labour Party (LP); Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso of New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP); and Professor Peter Umeadi of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA).
