Barcelona boss, Xavi, has said that young midfielder Pedri is at the level of the club’s legend Andres Iniesta. Xavi said this after Pedri’s starring role in Barcelona’s 2-1 win over Real Betis on Wednesday night in La Liga. Pedri was integral for Barcelona as they went eight points clear of rivals Real Madrid at the top of the La Liga table, continuing his brilliant form after netting the winner against Girona last time out. “He’s a player who is on another level, I’ve seen very few like him,” Xavi said at his post-match press conference. “He’s talented, he is at the level of Iniesta, but Andres has continuity to the point that he is still playing. “If we compare Pedri to Iniesta at the moment, Iniesta wins easily because he played for so long. For me, he’s the greatest talent Spanish football has ever produced. But Pedri is very good. He has a similar talent.”
