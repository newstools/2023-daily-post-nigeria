Famous Nigerian social critic, Aisha Yesufu, has claimed the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, could be likened to an independent candidate. Yesufu said Obi is running on the platform of the Labour Party because the law doesn’t allow an individual to contest as an independent candidate. Her statement is contained in a post via her verified Twitter handle on Wednesday. Yesufu, a strong supporter of Obi, was reacting to a tweet alleging that the Labour Party structure in Kwara state was being sabotaged. She said what matters is that people are with Obi. She wrote: “I have repeatedly told everyone that Peter Obi is like an independent candidate that is running through a party because the law requires he does so. The party is not the strength of Peter Obi. The people are his strength! “And as long as the people are with him that is all that matters. If you don’t sell out and I don’t sell out and other supporters do not sell out what does it matter whether some party members sell out? Are we not also getting other party members decamping in droves?”
