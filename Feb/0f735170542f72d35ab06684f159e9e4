Former Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, will reportedly sign French forward, Rayan Cherki, if he returns to Los Blancos as their manager for a third term. Zidane is one of the best managers in Real Madrid history, despite a disappointing ending to his second spell in charge of the La Liga champions. The Frenchman won nine trophies in his first stint in charge of Real Madrid, including three successive UEFA Champions League titles in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Zidane’s second spell didn’t go quite as well, with just one La Liga and one Spanish Super Cup won in his first season before a trophyless second. The former midfielder departed at the end of the 2020/2021 season and has been without a club since. Zidane has been linked with a return to Real Madrid and also a move to Paris Saint-Germain after missing out on France’s national team job recently. However, according to Fichajes, Zidane has not ruled out a third spell at Real Madrid and would be willing to return to the club when Carlo Ancelotti leaves his role as manager in the near future. The report added that if Zidane does take charge at Real Madrid, his first signing would likely be Cherki, who currently plays for Lyon.
