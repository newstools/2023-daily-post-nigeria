Popular Nigerian content creator and activist, Adebowale Debo Adedayo, better known as Mr Macaroni, has disowned the Labour Party campaign flyer bearing his picture. DAILY POST recalls that Mr Macaroni had, in November 2022, endorsed the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, as his preferred choice but was explicit that he would not participate in any political campaign. But a Twitter user on Wednesday drew Macaroni’s attention to the Obi-Datti campaign flyer with his image on it. The user said: “Thought @mrmacaronii said he would not be campaigning for any party.” Reacting to the tweet, Macaroni, in a post shared on his Twitter, distanced himself from the campaign flyer, saying his picture was used without his approval. ”I will address this again for clarity’s sake. I am voting for Peter Obi because he’s my preferred choice. It is my civic duty to vote, but I’m not obliged to campaign for him or any other politician. I am not against others who do so, but this was put out without my consent.” The development comes weeks after the Nigerian musician Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun, professionally known as Wizkid, also dissociated himself from a rumoured Obi concert.
