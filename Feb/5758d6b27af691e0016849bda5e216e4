Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has given a reason the campaign rally of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, was cancelled in his state. Recall that the rally was scheduled for Tuesday. Wike said that Atiku’s rally in Rivers was annulled because they lacked the numbers to fill the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium he approved for the event. The governor also described the claim by the PDP Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) that the campaign was put off because of fear of bloodshed as untrue. He spoke at Nyemoni Secondary School field in Abonnema town, the venue of the PDP campaign for Akuku-Toru Local Government Area, on Monday. Wike said, “I gave them the stadium, they know they’ve no capacity to fill the stadium, they’re looking for excuses. “They went and forced themselves to use government land at Trans Amadi. I said no, that wasn’t where I gave you. Where I gave you was Adokiye Amiesimaka, go and fill that place.” He added, “They now said no, we won’t go there again. We don’t want people to die. Who is killing who? Is anybody killing anybody? I said don’t pay money, I’ll buy the diesel for you. I’ll do everything for you. Mobilise, go, and fill that stadium. They ran away.”
