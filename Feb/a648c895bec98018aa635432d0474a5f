With 16 days to the presidential election, the leader of the Yoruba socio-cultural organization, Afenifere has been cautioned against threatening Nigeria’s unity over his preferred presidential candidate, Peter Obi of the Labour Party, LP. Adebanjo had cautioned that Nigeria might break up if the electorate fail to vote for Obi during the presidential election. Warning that Nigerians should prepare for war, Adebanjo explained that some forces are plotting to jettison Obi and vote for Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Adebanjo who averred that Obi is leading the crusade to get Nigeria out of bondage claimed there is a plot to ensure another northerner succeeds President Muhammadu Buhari. However, former Kaduna Central senator, Shehu Sani said Adebanjo’s threat is unbecoming of an elder statesman. In a tweet, Sani wrote: “The respected elder statesman Chief Ayo Adebanjo has the right to market his preferred presidential candidate, but threatening us on the breakup of our country if his candidate is not voted is unbecoming of him. “I also don’t think even his candidate will subscribe to this.”
