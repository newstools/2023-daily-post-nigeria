The Football Association, FA, are looking into the fracas that involved Arsenal and Aston Villa staff during the Gunners’ 4-2 victory on Saturday. Arsenal analyst Miguel Molina and Villa’s Victor Manas had an altercation in stoppage time of the game at Villa Park. At the time, Jorginho’s shot which bounced off Emi Martinez’s head gave Mikel Arteta’s men a 3-2 lead. On Monday, the FA announced they’re looking into the incident in the stands. It is claimed Manas, who worked at the Emirates during Unai Emery’s tenure, was furious at Molina’s celebrations in the press box. Stewards moved in to diffuse the tension and Molina eventually left the media area. Sources deny he was ejected. “No (I haven’t spoken to Miguel Molina). “Like anything that happens in the stands, we will look at it and address it and take action if necessary,” Arteta replied when asked about the incident after the game.
