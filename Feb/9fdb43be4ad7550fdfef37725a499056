Former Chelsea midfielder, John Obi Mikel has named Carlo Ancelotti as the best ‘man management’ he ever had at the Blues. Mikel said Ancelotti, who is currently the manager of Real Madrid, is so calm and never shouts at players. According to the former Super Eagles captain, every Chelsea player enjoyed training with the Italian. Speaking with Dubai Eye 103.8, Mikel said: “We enjoyed training with Carlo Ancelotti. He was the best in man management I ever heard at Chelsea. “When he came in, we played a little five-aside game, we did a little show run. The way he speaks to the players, he is so calm. “He doesn’t raise his voice towards the players or shout at you. He passes his message across in a meaningful way. Other managers will shout at you if you are not doing well, like Mourinho, he is a totally different animal.”
