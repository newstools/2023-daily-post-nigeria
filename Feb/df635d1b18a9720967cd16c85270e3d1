The Kogi State High Court in Lokoja has ordered the arrest and remand of the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa, in prison. Justice Rukayat Ayoola ruled that Bawa should be picked up and remanded in Kuje prison for disobeying a court order. Ayoola also directed the Inspector General of Police to ensure compliance because the EFCC boss committed contempt of court. The judge ruled that the EFCC Czar should be remanded for the next 14 days. In his ruling, the judge granted an application for Bawa to be remanded in prison because he disobeyed a court ruling delivered on November 30, 2022. The anti-corruption boss was directed to produce an applicant in a case, Ali Bello. Counsel to the applicant, Sumaila Abbas, had dragged Bawa to court for arresting and detaining Bello illegally, with the court ruling in his favour, only for the EFCC to arraign him for alleged money laundering three days after the ruling. But, EFCCâ€™s applications for setting aside and stay of execution of the ruling were refused for want of merit.
