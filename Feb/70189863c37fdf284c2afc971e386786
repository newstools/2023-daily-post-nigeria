Manchester City legend, David Silva, is reportedly set for a shock move to join Al-Nassr forward Cristiano Ronaldo in the Saudi Pro League (SPL). According to Relevo, Silva has a ‘dizzying’ offer from the SPL to join Ronaldo in the Middle East as Garry Cook, former executive director of Manchester City, is currently the CEO of the Saudi Arabia top-flight league. Recall that Al Nassr recently made history when they signed Ronaldo as a free agent last December. The Portugal captain joined the Riyad-based club after mutually terminating his contract with Manchester United prior to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Silva, meanwhile, currently plays for La Liga club Real Sociedad. The 37-year-old Spaniard has made 20 appearances for Real Sociedad this season, scoring two goals and providing four assists. The midfielder joined Sociedad in 2020 after a glittering spell with Man City.
