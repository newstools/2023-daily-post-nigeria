Arsenal midfielder, Thomas Partey, will not be in the squad to face Manchester City on Wednesday night. According to The Athletic, Partey has picked up a muscular injury. The Ghana international trained with the squad on Tuesday but is expected to miss the fixture at the Emirates. The 29-year-old has started 18 of Arsenal’s 21 matches in the Premier League this season and scored twice. He could be replaced in the side by Jorginho, who signed from Chelsea on transfer deadline day. Arsenal welcome City sitting three points ahead of them in the table, but knowing that they will be usurped at the top should Pep Guardiola’s men beat them.
