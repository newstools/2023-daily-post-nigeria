Former Arsenal star Ian Wright has expressed his displeasure over the officiating in Chelsea’s 1-1 draw against West United in the Premier League on Saturday. Chelsea took the lead in the London Stadium in the first half but West Ham responded through Blues former player Emerson, who tapped from the far post. Conor Gallagher’s effort from just outside the box struck the arm of Tomas Soucek as he fell to the ground when trying to block the said shot. The Blues players were up in arms, surrounding the referee as they pleaded for a spot-kick. However, despite consultation of the video assistant referee team of David Coote and Nick Greenhalgh, nothing was given. But former Arsenal forward Ian Wright felt otherwise, saying on Premier League Productions, “He’s falling like a goalkeeper. That’s how goalkeepers dive to make a save. How anyone could look at that and said it was because he’s falling is ludicrous. “Just look at him as a defender that is trying to defend, why are you going to the ground? You stay on your feet and try to block it. “That’s a clear penalty for me. Chelsea have been denied the opportunity to win this game. “They deserve more from this and this is where the officials should have helped you. Because they’re still on the advantage, they’re still trying to score. They’ve been denied a penalty.”
