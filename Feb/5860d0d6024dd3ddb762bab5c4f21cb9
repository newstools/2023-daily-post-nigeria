Barely one week to the forthcoming presidential election, a spokesperson for Tinubu, Shettima Presidential Campaign Council, Bayo Onanuga, has insisted that his principal deserves the support of President Muhammadu Buhari. The statement is contained in a post via his Twitter handle on Saturday. Onanuga noted that Tinubu campaigned vigorously for Buhari during the 2015 presidential election, adding that he (Buhari) should do the same for Tinubu now that he is running for president. He wrote, “Tinubu then in 2014/2015 campaigning vigorously for Muhammadu Buhari in Abeokuta. It should be payback time, I believe.”
