Mr. Lamido was earlier not recognized by the Biometric Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) after following a long queue to cast his vote at Bamaina primary school ll polling unit. The ex-governor, however, resolved to allow other people behind him to continue. He later came back for the accreditation. While reacting to the BVAS failure, Lamido described it as a “human error.” The presidential election results: PDP 176, APC 04. For the senatorial election, PDP 174, APC 05.
