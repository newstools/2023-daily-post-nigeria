Senator Smart Adeyemi (APC-Kogi) on Tuesday called on former Vice-President, Atiku Abubakar to apologise to Nigerians for selling the country’s assets rather than seeking to occupy the presidential seat. Adeyemi, who represents Kogi West at the National Assembly, stated this when he interacted with indigenes of Kogi residing in Minna at a forum called ‘Tinubu/Shettima Renewed Hope 2023’. According to him, Atiku should beg Nigerians for selling the country’s collective wealth. Adeyemi said, “Atiku [Abubakar], under his watch as chairman of privatisation, sold our collective wealth and that was the origin of poverty and insecurity in Nigeria. “So, Atiku should first apologise to Nigerians for the way and manner they expended N16million dollars for power holding and yet we don’t have 24hours power supply.”
