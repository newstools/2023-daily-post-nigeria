Apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has dismissed the purported assassination plot against the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. DAILY POST recalls that Mr. Emma Powerful, the spokesman of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, had alleged of a plot to assassinate Atiku in the South-East. However, in a statement issued on Monday by the National President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, he urged Atiku to ignore the alleged plot. Okwu said there was nothing to warrant the killing of Atiku or anyone else in the South-East, stressing that all the presidential candidates were free to come to the region and present their blueprints to the masses. He noted that “We received with concern the statement credited to IPOB, wherein they alleged that there was a plot to assassinate the PDP presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar in the South-East. “We want to make it clear that no such plot exists anywhere in Igboland. Ndigbo are known for their hospitality and this has not changed. “The PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar has an Igbo man, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as his running mate for the election. He is also an in-law to Ndigbo and should therefore feel free to come to the South-East for his campaign any day any time.” Okwu cautioned against any action or statement that would create unnecessary tension in the South-East.
