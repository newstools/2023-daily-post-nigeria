Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has revealed that midfielder Thomas Partey will need ‘another week’ before returning to first-team action for the club. Arteta spoke before Arsenal’s Premier League tie with Aston Villa on Saturday. Partey missed out on Arsenal’s top-of-the-table clash with Manchester City last Wednesday after picking up a muscular injury. Arsenal lost 3-1 in Partey’s absence and now sit in second position in the Premier League table, having led since August. Partey was also not included in Arsenal’s squad against Aston Villa at Villa Park. Speaking to BT Sport, Arteta said of the Ghanaian international before Arsenal’s kick-off with Aston Villa, “He’s not fit. He didn’t even train with us yesterday. “He was not feeling good enough to do that, so he probably needs another week.”
