Fidelity Bank Plc has announced an impressive growth in Profit Before Tax to N52billion for the Full Year 2022. This was made known in its unaudited statement of account presented to the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) on Wednesday, 31 January 2023. According to the regulatory filing, the bank grew Gross Earnings by 33.9% to N335.897billion (from N250.774billion in FY 2021). Net Interest Income grew by 61.1% to N152.813billion (from N94.877billion in FY 2021), leading to a Profit After Tax of N47.163billion for FY 2022 (from N35.579billion in FY 2021).

Despite growing its gross earnings at an impressive rate, Fidelity Bank recorded one of the lowest Non-Performing Loans (NPL) ratios in the Nigerian banking industry.
