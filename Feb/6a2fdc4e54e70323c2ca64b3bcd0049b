Chelsea hero, William Gallas, has slammed defender Marc Cucurella for doing ‘nothing’ during the team’s Premier League 1-1 draw with West Ham United over the weekend. Gallas also hailed Chelsea’s January signing, Enzo Fernandez, for his display against West Ham. DAILY POST reports that goals from Joao Felix and Emerson Palmieri ensured both Chelsea and West Ham got a point each at the London Stadium. “Enzo Fernandes looks good, he has great qualities. He got a nice assist for [Joao] Felix in the game,” Gallas told Genting Casino. “The football was better, but they still have the same problems at the back. “Marc Cucurella did not do anything of note in the game [against West Ham], in my opinion. Chilwell, he came on, and in the 25 minutes he played, he did more than Cucurella. “Chelsea still have somewhat of a problem on the left side, and that’s where the West Ham goal came from.”
