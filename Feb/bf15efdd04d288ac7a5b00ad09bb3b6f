The Federal Capital Territory Senatorial candidate, for Labour Party, Ireti kingibe, has cried out over an alleged move to rig her out of the election. According to her, she has already sighted her victory but it is now slipping off her fingers as her opponents are doing everything now to steal her mandate. Addressing a press conference in Abuja on Monday, she narrated how thugs attacked the Gwarinpa Collafion Centre and destroyed result sheets even those of the presidential election. “All the result sheets show that there was no over-voting at the polling units so how would you now cancel the whole area council? We have watched them. Millions and millions have been bribed in this place even up to million dollars have been put into this place. They’re trying to take the seat and it’s not going to happen,” the heartbroken politicians said. “We are not going to watch them and we are not standing for this rubbish. Everywhere they cancelled all the polling units where we’re strong. INEC Collation Centre that supposed strong and have enough security they went and tore everything even the presidential result sheets. Thugs went to Gwarinpa Collation Centre, attacked it and tore all the presidential result sheets and went away. “They’ve looking for reasons to cancel Usuma ward but they couldn’t, cancel Bwari Central they couldn’t, those are our strongholds but they couldn’t. Unfortunately they found an error in the total and they said it was over-voting but the EO said ‘no, it is not. It is an error from whoever wrote it whether the person did it on purpose or for whatever purpose it’s an error you can personalise the candidate. What kind of country are we running? What the leaders of this country are looking for, they’ll find it. “Those of us at the bottom have heard enough. We certainly have. When you complain of anything they will say go to poll but when you go to poll and they’re still complaining it’s not enough. The will of the people must be done.”
