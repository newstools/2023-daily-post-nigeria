Former Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, is looking forward to his next project in football management. Zidane is yet to take up a managerial position in football since leaving Los Blancos in 2021. The Frenchman had his heart set on taking charge of Les Bleus, but Didier Deschamps was handed a new deal after the 2022 FIFA World Cup last December. The former midfielder has been linked to coach Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain of late. However, speaking recently, as cited by Marca, Zidane said he could return to management before the end of the season. Zidane said, “It’s part of our agreement (with Alpine). If I have to commit to a team tomorrow, it won’t stop me from continuing to work. “To go back to coaching is still my wish. I have time today, but I don’t know how long it will last. I have time right now, maybe until June, but it can also go very quickly.”
