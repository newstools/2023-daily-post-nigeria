As your GOC, I urge you to do what is right. You are not supposed to support anybody, you are not supposed to disgrace the army by collecting money, and you are not supposed to carry a ballot box for anybody. The Chief of Army Staff has made it very clear, that the Army is nonpartisan. Let the people choose who they want. “Your duty during the elections is to assist the police to ensure that there is no breakdown of law and order. The duty of a soldier is not to help anybody and carry the ballot box. Any person found culpable would be decisively dealt with.” The GOC stated.
