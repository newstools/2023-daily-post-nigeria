An actress, Oluwadarasimi Omoseyin, who was earlier arrested by the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission, ICPC, is now being investigated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC. Operatives of the Lagos zonal office of the EFCC commenced an investigation of Omoseyin, a cosmetologist, for allegedly tampering with the new naira notes. The EFCC on Friday said the offence was contrary to Section 21 (5) of the Central Bank of Nigeria Act, 2007. The ICPC nabbed the suspect on Wednesday along Awolowo Road, Ikoyi, Lagos, following an intelligence report. The 31-year-old was arrested following the sharing of an online video of her spraying and stepping on the new naira notes at a party. In the said video, the actress was reportedly seen flaunting wads of the newly redesigned naira notes. She was subsequently handed over to the EFCC on Thursday for further investigations. “Items recovered from her at the point of arrest include a Range Rover and iPhone mobile devices. The suspect will be charged to court once investigations have been concluded,” the EFCC said.
