Former Super Eagles handler, Gernot Rohr is set to be named new head coach of the Benin Republic national team. According to reports emanating from the West African country, the Benin Football Federation (FBF) met on Tuesday to ratify the appointment of the Franco-German. Rohr will take over from former Benin international Moussa Latoundji, who has been in temporary charge of the Squirrels since last year. The 69-year-old was sacked by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) in December 2021 despite guiding the Super Eagles to 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualification and the playoff round of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Rohrâ€™s first game in charge of the Squirrels will be the 2023 AFCON qualifier against Rwanda next month. Benin are bottom of Group L after losing their opening two games against Senegal and Mozambique.
