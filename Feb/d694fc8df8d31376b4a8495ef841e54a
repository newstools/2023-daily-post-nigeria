Ahead of the forthcoming general elections, a former Nigerian lawmaker, Shehu Sani, has warned that electing a wrong leader would plunge the country into another four years of darkness. Sani also called on Nigerians to be guided by their conscience and experience and elect a competent leader. His statement was contained in a post via his verified Twitter handle on Tuesday. Sani, also a social critic, urged Nigerians not to allow religious leaders to mislead them. “On Saturday, this country has a date with history. Don’t vote for a candidate because your mosques or churches asked you to do so. Be guided by your conscience and experience & elect a competent leader. A wrong choice is another 4 years of journey into darkness,” he tweeted.
