The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has presented Senator Teslim Kolawole Folarin to the people of Oyo State as the gubernatorial candidate of the APC. Tinubu presented Folarin to the electorate on Thursday in Ibadan at an APC rally.  There had been speculations that Tinubu was not comfortable with the candidature of Folarin, however, many of those who taught that the presidential candidate did not like Folarin were disappointed when he raised the former’s hands as the candidate of APC in the 11th March gubernatorial election in the state. After raising Folarin’s hand facing all sections of the crowd at the rally, Tinubu presented him with a flag of the party.  Some of the APC stalwarts present at the event were the Speaker, House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila; Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, former governors Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti) and Adeboyega Oyetola (Osun). Others are APC candidates in the state among whom are Barrister Sharafadeen Abiodun Alli (Oyo South) Dr. Yunus Akintunde (Oyo Central) and Dr. Abdulfatai Buhari (Oyo North).
