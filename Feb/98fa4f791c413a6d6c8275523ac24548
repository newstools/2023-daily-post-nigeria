One person has been confirmed dead after today’s building collapse in Gwarinpa Estate, Abuja. The structure collapsed at about 11am at 4th Avenue close to H-Medix with many trapped. The three-storey building which has a basement caved in on an unspecified number of workers. The Federal Capital Territory Emergency Management Agency (FCT-FEMA) is coordinating the response. In an update Thursday evening, the agency confirmed more than a dozen have been evacuated. “19 persons have so far been rescued, 1 fatally injured,” said Nkechi Isa, the Public Relations Officer. “The victims have been taken to Wuse, Gwarinpa, Asokoro district hospitals, and the Federal Medical Centre.” Some construction companies with heavy duty equipment were part of the rescue efforts, Isa added.
