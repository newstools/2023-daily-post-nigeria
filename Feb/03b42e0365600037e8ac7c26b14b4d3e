The chairperson of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Rufa’i Alkali, has called on the standard bearer of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, to shelve his presidential bid for their candidate Rabiu Kwankwaso. Alkali stated this during a media conference in Abuja on Wednesday. He said the claim that Atiku is in talks with NNPP so he could emerge as “the consensus northern candidate” is false. “We have no engagement with Atiku Abubakar on any level. “What will someone want to offer in northern Nigeria, if not Kwankwaso — since they’re talking about northern Nigeria now? “The NNPP fully dissociates itself from Atiku’s antics. We want Atiku Abubakar to step down for Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso,” Alkali said.
