Arsenal have received a major boost ahead of their trip to Leicester City on Saturday with Thomas Partey set to be passed fit to play. Gunners boss, Mikel Arteta is hopeful the Ghana midfielder, who has missed the last two games with a muscle injury, will be part of his squad. Also, striker Gabriel Jesus is now very close to making his eagerly anticipated return following knee surgery. Asked about the possibility of Partey being involved this weekend, Arteta said: “Obviously there is a question mark on Thomas, he hasn’t trained much. “But it looks like he could be available. Let’s see how he trains today [Friday].” On Jesus, the Spaniard added: “He’s progressing well. Doing more and more on the field. “The knee’s not reacting so it’s positive. We want him back quickly but respect the timeline from the doctors.”
