The vice-presidential candidates of the Labour Party, LP, and Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Datti Baba-Ahmed and Ifeanyi Okowa respectively, have asked the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to cancel the general election. Baba-Ahmed and Okowa made this demand while addressing a joint press conference at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel in Abuja. “So the right thing for the INEC chairman to do is to cancel the elections. Unfortunately, he has not come out to tell the world why the results were not uploaded. There is a question mark there. He needs to be truthful,” Okowa said.
