Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has tasked the new Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps, NYSC, to dismantle a syndicate issuing ‘OLUWOLE NYSC’ certificates to members of the public. The group said it suspects the existence of a syndicate in the Scheme. HURIWA said it suspects that the duty of the syndicate is to lure unsuspecting members of the public, especially those contesting for political positions, and dupe them. “We will be writing to the new Director General of the NYSC to task him to set up an independent panel of investigators to uncover the members of this syndicate,” the rights advocacy group said in a press conference in Abuja on Thursday. The group also feels that the victims must have paid huge fees for the fake certificates.
