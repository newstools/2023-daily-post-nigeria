Former Arsenal man William Gallas has questioned the club’s signing of Leandro Trossard from Brighton this January. Trossard was among the three new faces that joined Arsenal this January. Others were Poland international Jakub Kiwior and former Chelsea midfielder Jorginho. Arsenal decided to sign Trossard after Chelsea hijacked their deal for Mykhailo Mudryk from Shakhtar Donetsk. Gallas doubts the former Brighton attacker’s ability to lift the Gunners and help them achieve their dream of winning the Premier League title this season. He told gentingcasino: “I don’t know if Leandro Trossard is a good signing. He has a big profile like his fellow teammates but the question is, can he lift his level at a big club? “If it’s a good signing, he will help take Arsenal to victory.”
