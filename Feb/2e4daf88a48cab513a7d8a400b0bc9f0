Nigerian afrobeat singer and songwriter, Adekunle Almoruf Kosoko, popularly known as Adekunle Gold, has blamed President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration for the hardship in the country. This is coming a few days after Nollywood actress Omotola Jalade lamented over the suffering of Nigerians. However, the ‘It is what it is’ crooner said the Buhari-led administration had done nothing other than waste eight years of Nigerians’ lives. In a tweet, Adekunle Gold said the country has been in regression since the Buhari administration took over in 2015. “This current administration wasted 8 years of our lives. 8 years, we regressed as a nation,” he wrote. In 2022, Adekunkle Gold had disclosed to his fans that he was born with sickle cell disease, adding that at the age of 20, he begged God to take his life due to the unbearable crisis. The singer is currently married to Nigeria’s top vocalist, Simisola, and is blessed with a daughter.
