Youths of Anaku community in the Ayamelum Local Government Area of Anambra State have allegedly abducted a soldier sent to the area on a peace mission. The youths are also alleged to have taken away the service gun belonging to the soldier. Chairman of Ayamelum Local Government Area, Chief Livinus Onyenwe, disclosed this to journalists on Monday. There has been an ongoing land feud between Anaku and Omor communities in the local government. Last week, in the latest uprising, Anaku youths allegedly killed eight people from Omor, leading to the posting of soldiers to the area to maintain peace. Speaking on the abduction of the soldier, Onyenwe said a gun duel ensued between the soldiers and the youth and it ended in the abduction of one of the soldiers whose gun was also taken away. According to him, the soldiers in retaliation pulled down the house of the gang leader, and those of some other youths suspected to belong to the deadly gang. “The state governor, Prof Chukwuma Soludo has directed youths of the community to immediately release the soldier and return his gun. “The governor also directed law enforcement agencies to do everything within their constitutional powers to ensure that the soldier was rescued, and his rifle returned,” he stated. Anambra State Police Command’s spokesperson, DSP Tochukwu Ikenga was unavailable for confirmation of the report.
