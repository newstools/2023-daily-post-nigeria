The Lagos State Police Command has commenced investigations into the attacks on Labour Party, LP, supporters. The citizens were heading to Peter Obi’s rally at the Tafawa Balewa Square, TBS, in Onikan on Saturday when they were attacked. At least four persons were injured by the hoodlums who ambushed them and others with clubs and machetes. Police Public Relations Officer, SP Benjamin Hundeyin said the Criminal Investigation Department (SCID) has taken over the probe. A statement by the spokesperson confirmed the Ilasan Division earlier commenced preliminary investigations. The police condemned the attack and advised political leaders to prevail on their followers to be law-abiding and shun violence. “The Command will leave no stone unturned to deal decisively with offenders in accordance with the law,” Hundeyin added. The LP presidential candidate and his entourage arrived at the TBS late Saturday afternoon after stops at Alaba International Market, Mile 2 and Orile.
