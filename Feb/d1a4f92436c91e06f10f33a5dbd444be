Former federal lawmaker, Shehu Sani has told President Muhammadu Buhari to expect more attacks from Governors of his political party, the All Progressives Congress, APC, following his new monetary policies. Buhari, in his broadcast on Thursday, directed the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, to allow only the old N200 notes to co-circulate with the new N200, N500 and N1000 banknotes for 60 days. Since the broadcast, some APC governors have vehemently kicked against the President’s decision, with Governor Umar Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State coming hard on Buhari for refusing to abide by the Supreme Court orders and going ahead with the ban on the old Naira Notes. In an audio recording, Ganduje was quoted asking, “President Buhari should remember that for several times he was trying to contest for presidency but he could not make it until there was an alliance.” Ganduje said that after enjoying everything, Buhari has “turned back against the same democratic system that saw him to office”. Also, the Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai slammed the President over the decision and asked residents of the State to continue using the old Naira notes. In his broadcast to the people of Kaduna State, El-rufai urged them to stand up strongly for democracy, peace and national unity. And in his reaction, Sani, a member of the 8th National Assembly, who represented Kaduna central senatorial district, tweeted, “The President should expect more attacks from his Party’s Governors. “He has taken the miracle stick and crossed and wants to leave his men in the middle of the Red Sea.”
