Comrade Isaac Balami, the Deputy Campaign Manager of the Obi/Datti Campaign Organization, has charged the Independent National Electoral Commission to declare the true results of the Nigerian people and not the alleged fake results being collated at the International Conference Centre, ICC, in Abuja. Speaking with journalists on Monday at the Maiduguri airport while returning to Abuja after the poll, Balami said INEC should know that this is not the generation to joke with. He advised INEC and the security agents to declare Peter Obi of the Labour Party the winner considering that he was leading in the polls that were held across the country on Saturday. Balami alleged that INEC and the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC resorted to the manipulation of results after the exercise. According to him: “My advice is that it is obvious that Peter Obi is leading because Nigerians came out to vote for him. “And I just want to advise INEC and all the security agents, that for the sake of their unborn children, they should not mess with the Nigerian youths. “This is not the generation to joke with, because we have had it to the neck and we are tired. They should not try to rig this exercise. “And to the international community as well; they have gone round as observers, and if Peter Obi is not declared as we voted for him, they should be ready for millions and millions of refugees because Nigerians are tired.”
