Former Manchester United defender, Gary Neville, has said Chelsea overspent on Enzo Fernandez and Marc Cucurella. Neville also questioned Blues co-owner Todd Boehly’s “strange” approach in the transfer market. Boehly has splashed out almost £600m on new signings since buying the Premier League club from Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich last year. Neville believes Boehly’s strategy is similar to when Ed Woodward arrived at Old Trafford and tried to sign “everyone.” “Marc Cucurella for £64m and Enzo Fernandez for £107m – that’s a full-back and a midfielder who will sit at the base of a three. “The ceiling on those types of players – like Rodri, Fabinho, Casemiro – they are £50-60m positions. “These aren’t players that are playing in the forward part of the pitch and scoring you 30 goals, so what they’re getting for the money, they just seem like strange transfers,” Neville said on Sky Bet’s The Overlap.
