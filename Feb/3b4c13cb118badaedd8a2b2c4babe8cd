Cynthia, wife of Big Brother Naija reality TV show host, Ebuka Obi Uchendu has condemned a threat made against her husband by a fan of Big Brother Titans, BBTitans. The troll, who felt Ebuka’s question to one of the BBTitans housemates, Yemi Cregx during the Sunday eviction night show was unfair, took to social media to curse him. “Now I pray everyday against Ebuka, Ebuka will never know peace until he undo what he has done against Yemi Cregx.” Reacting to this, Cynthia in a tweet said, “You and your entire generation will never know peace in Jesus Name. The audacity for you people to constantly harass someone to do something, then when it’s done and the result doesn’t go the way you expect, you result in sending death threats. “The ridiculousness of you lot to be so vile and toxic over a bloody entertainment show. Even the people you think should have sense spent their day here tweeting vile things about human beings.” Recall that Ebuka had on Sunday during the eviction live show called Yemi out for always leaving Khosi’s bed for Blue Aiva’s every night around 2 am.
