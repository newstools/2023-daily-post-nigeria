Former Governor of Katsina State, Ibrahim Shehu Shema has appealed to all Nigerian leaders, men and women of goodwill to speak up for the collective national interest as there is no perfect election anywhere in the world. Shema, who made the call in Katsina on Wednesday, urged Nigerians to eschew tribal, religious, or personal interests for the nation’s unity. According him, there is no election anywhere in the world without complaints, and that of Nigeria cannot be an exemption. He therefore urged Nigerians to learn to manage our situation in the interest of Nigeria and for all Nigerians. However, in order to build an enduring system that will succeed, Shema said, Nigerians democracy must be anchored on the rule of law. “Our democratic institutions must be encouraged and supported in discharging their roles in accordance with the laws of the land.” He also called on all political, regional, religious, traditional, and business leaders to join hands in supporting and deepening Nigeria’s democracy in the interest of peace and unity and to calm our nation. In the same vein, Shema appealed to all leading candidates in the contest to come together and speak with one voice for the peace, unity, and stability of this country they seek to lead. Shema also tasked Nigeria’s security agencies to step up their games in ensuring effective discharge of their constitutional responsibilities of protecting the lives and property of Nigerians wherever they are.
