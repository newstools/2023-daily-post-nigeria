Manchester United failed to claim a famous win at Barcelona, after Raphinha’s shot flew past David De Gea to nick a draw for the hosts in their Europa League knockout tie on Thursday. The LaLiga leaders took the lead thanks to Marcos Alonso’s header five minutes after the break. The in-form Marcus Rashford drew United level with a finish from an acute angle. Erik ten Hag’s men then went in front after Jules Kounde put the ball into his own net. With Barca heading towards defeat, Raphinha whipped in a cross from the right that evaded Robert Lewandowski’s touch and crept into the net. United will host the reverse fixture next Thursday.
