Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State has urged Nigerians to continue spending the old denominations of the redesigned naira notes. El-Rufai said Nigerians should disregard the directives of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, because the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu would reverse the decision if elected on February 25th. Speaking in Kaduna, the governor said: “Continue running your businesses and daily activities with whatever notes (old or new) you have. Don’t rush yourself into taking old naira notes to the bank, and wasting your time in the unnecessary queues at the bank. Nobody can stop you (people) from using the notes. When we come to power, if Bola Tinubu becomes the president, we’ll give people more time to get rid of the old naira notes.” CBN had said the old version of the N200, N500 and N1000 notes would cease to be a legal tender from February 10 in Nigeria. This has led many Nigerians thronging commercial banks in a bid to deposit the old notes and get the new ones. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court stopped the CBN from stopping the use of the old naira notes.
