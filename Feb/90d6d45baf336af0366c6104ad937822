Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki has ordered the arrest of his predecessor, Adams Oshiomhole for allegedly mobilising thugs to vandalise banks and disrupt the peace of the State over the naira scarcity. Obaseki, in a statement signed by the Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Chris Nehikhare, on Wednesday, said, “We have been around the city all day, speaking with the protesters, and we discovered that it is more than meets the eye. “At this stage, we call on security agencies to arrest Adams Oshiomhole for questioning and to account for his movement, especially here in Benin City in the last few days. He deliberately instigated the protest of the people. “I know people will see the protest as a result of scarcity of naira notes, but even if that is the case, Nigerians should know which political party is involved, because it is ironic that the same party that is responsible for this policy is still sending people to destroy Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, billboards.” Protests had rocked many parts of Nigeria over the lack of the naira notes, with three people reportedly killed on Wednesday in Benin City during violent demonstrations.
