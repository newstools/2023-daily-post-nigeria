Former Liverpool star, Stan Collymore, has revealed that Chelsea would be one of the clubs looking to appoint Jurgen Klopp as their next manager to take over from Graham Potter if the German left the Reds. Klopp has enjoyed tremendous success at Liverpool since joining the Anfield club from Borussia Dortmund back in 2015. He has led Liverpool to win the Premier League, Champions League, League Cup, FA Cup, Super Cup and Club World Cup in the past. But the 55-year-old is now under huge pressure at Liverpool amid the team’s poor performances so far this season. Liverpool are currently in the 10th position on the Premier League table and eleven points off the top four following their recent humiliating 3-0 loss against Wolves over the weekend. “The reality is, if FSG sack Klopp, there is no one else out there better equipped to do a better job,” Collymore told Caught Offside. “So anyone calling for him to go should be careful what they wish for because I am certain that if he suddenly became available, you would have Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, PSG, and even Chelsea all lining up.” He continued, “I still don’t think Jurgen Klopp should be facing the sack at Liverpool. I know they are having an awful season, but we need to look further back than just the past six months. “Remember where Liverpool were when he came in – they were a real mess! “They had a below-average squad, were barely competitive and could not attract top players. “Klopp single-handedly changed all of that and went on to win every trophy possible along the way, and he did not just turn them into a winning side, he completely revolutionised their style of play.”
