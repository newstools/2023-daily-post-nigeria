Arsenal legend, Ian Wright, has singled out three players for praise after the Gunners Premier League 1-0 win over Leicester City on Saturday. Wright said the three players Gabriel Martinelli, Bukayo Saka and William Saliba, are the ‘future’ of Arsenal after Mikel Arteta’s side defeated Leicester at King Power Stadium. Arsenal defeated Leicester in an away Premier League tie, thanks to Martinelli’s only goal of the match. “We know what he is capable of,” Wright told Premier League Productions when asked about Martinelli’s performance against Leicester. “Another one that has signed a new deal and we are happy to have him here. He is the future for us. Him, Bukayo Saka and William Saliba are the future for us. “You want them in situations and games like this so they can get more experience because we are going to need them in the future.”
