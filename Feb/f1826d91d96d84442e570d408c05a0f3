Liverpool legend, Graeme Souness, has doubts Manchester United will go on to win the Premier League title ahead of Arsenal and Manchester City. Souness, however, did admit it is not impossible for Man United to win the title ahead of their rivals. Man United are currently third in the Premier League with five points behind leaders Arsenal and three points behind second position Man City following their latest 3-0 win over Leicester City on Sunday. “No, it’s not impossible,” Souness said when asked by Sky Sports about Man United’s chances of winning the Premier League title. “I very much doubt it. Several things would have to happen. Both City and Arsenal would have to have an incredible collapse – enough to fall off the cliff – I don’t think that will happen.”
