A former Minister of Police Affairs, Alhaji Jelili Adesiyan has declared that Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has better credentials than other presidential candidates such as Alhaji Abubakar Atiku of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Mr. Peter Obi of Labour Party. Jelili, who was the Chairman, Screening Committee of 2022 All Progressives Congress (APC) Primary election in Oyo State, made this disclosure on Monday. He spoke while featuring at a guest platform programme organised by Correspondents’ chapel of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Oyo state council in Ibadan. Adesiyan who is a member of Campaign Committee for Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu Presidential election, said that Tinubu is more qualified to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari than Atiku, Obi and other presidential candidates. He spoke further by saying that Tinubu is the only person that can bridge the gap between the poor and the rich. He added that Tinubu will correct the present problems confronting the country Adesiyan said, “We have array of presidential candidates, Atiku who has been running over time, Kwankwaso who has been in PDP then APC and now in NNPP, Peter Obi who was in APGA, then moved to PDP and now in Labour party. Obasanjo is the best person to say something about his running mate. “Tinubu, everyone knows that Tinubu has better credentials to govern this country. We will see Nigeria as one place. “Most of the things we have been clamouring for since the period of NADECO are in his pocket. “So, there is no doubt that Tinubu is the best candidate. He is the only person that can bridge the gap between the poor and the rich. “The situation in Nigeria is not palatable to us. Insecurity is the bane of development in this country. “If you want to travel from here to Osogbo, you need to take some security escorts. These are the things we think Tinubu will correct. The love of the masses is paramount in his heart”.
