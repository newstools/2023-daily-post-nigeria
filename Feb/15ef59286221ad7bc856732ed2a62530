Enyimba head coach George Finidi heaped plaudits on his players for their impressive performance in the first half of their 2-0 home win against El-Kanemi Warriors on Sunday. Emeka Obioma grabbed his second brace in as many games as the People’s Elephant returned to winning ways following the 1-0 defeat to Remo Stars in midweek. The forward took his season’s tally to four as Enyimba sealed off the game with an emphatic first-half performance. “It’s always good to score in the first half, you know in the Nigerian league, if you don’t score in the first half, the opponents will start using delay tactics or whatever can be done to achieve result,” Finidi told Enyimbafc.net. “But when you score, they will come out more. We could have won the game with more goals, but we didn’t take our chances. “At the end of the day, we won 2-0 and I’m happy with our performance. Two goals and two points.” The Aba giants are third on the Group A log with 10 points from six games.
