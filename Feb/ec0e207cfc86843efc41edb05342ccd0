Former Arsenal star, Lauren, has shared his opinion on the title race between Arsenal and Manchester City. Manchester United and Newcastle are still in the title race as teams in the top four breathe down the necks of one another. Arsenal welcome Manchester City for their outstanding match in the Premier League this season and while a win would put the Gunners six points clear in the table, City will go top with a victory at the Emirates. Lauren said he was worried that Mikel Arteta’s Gunners might not be able to absorb the pressure that would hit teams contending for the title towards the end of the season. Asked for his take on the Premier League title race, Lauren told Betway: “It’s going to be tight until the end of the season. “Man City will lose points, Arsenal will lose points, as will Man United and Newcastle. We saw that a couple of weekends ago with Arsenal’s defeat against Everton and City’s defeat against Tottenham, so it’s not going to be as clear as we thought. “I’m a little bit concerned about Arsenal, not about the performance of the team. I’m more concerned about how their players can handle the big pressure. “When the title is very close, how will they address the pressure and deal with the big moments?”
