Lionel Messi has admitted he was terrified after Argentina began the 2022 World Cup in a disastrous manner, losing their first group game to lowly-rated Saudi Arabia. Argentina got to the final of the competition where they defeated France via a penalty shootout and were crowned world champions. Very few, however, would have tipped Lionel Messi and Co to win the World Cup after the disastrous start they had. But the South Americans bounced back and went on to win the next six matches and the former Barcelona man, in a chat with Argentine outlet Diario Ole, opened up about the shocking game. The PSG star said he was fearful of Argentina’s chances of progressing to the next stages of the competition after the setback but claimed that it all changed after the Mexico win. “Obviously I was very scared because the game didn’t turn out as we expected,” Messi said. “But all the strength of the group was shown after the game we won against Mexico, everything was strengthened. Against Arabia, it was one of our worst games.”
