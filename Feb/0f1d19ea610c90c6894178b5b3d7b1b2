Former House of Representatives Speaker, Yakubu Dogara has claimed that the Independent National Electoral Commission “cooked” the results of the 2023 presidential election. Dogara, writing on his Twitter page, urged President Muhammadu Buhari not to allow “this sham to stand”. The ex-lawmaker was reacting to a statement released by former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, who called on Buhari to take urgent steps to address the tensions that followed allegations of discrepancies in election results. Obasanjo also called for elections to be cancelled and redone in areas found to have been affected by compromise. “If PMB allows this sham to stand, then my simple request to him is to order INEC to share whatever they got for cooking this result with the masses as compensation for the needless hardship they endured due to the Naira redesign policy. “INEC could never have done this for free!” Dogara tweeted. He added: “I am absolutely gutted because I had so much faith in @inecnigeria and helped to propagate the lies that it was ready for a free, fair and credible election. “Now, I realise, it was a farcical illusion that was sold to me.”
