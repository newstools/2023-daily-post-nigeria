The Coalition of Transporters has threatened to picket headquarters of the Nigeria National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) over fuel scarcity. Their communique issued on Monday was signed by Jamilu Mai Alheri, Chairman of Trailer Drivers Association (TADAN), and five others. They are Tricycles Owners Association of Nigeria (TOWAN), National Association of Traders of Nigeria (NASTAN), Commercial Motorcycles Association of Nigeria (COMAN). Others include Market Women Association of Nigeria (MAWAN), Trailer Drivers Association of Nigeria (TADAN), and Luxurious Bus Operators Union (LUBOU). The unions have put their members nationwide on alert to join the protest if nothing was done to end the scarcity. The associations said they would continue to occupy the NNPCL Towers in Abuja until the problem was fixed. They also threatened not to make their vehicles available to transport Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) materials for the elections. The unions complained that the lingering fuel shortage had placed them in an unbearable condition. The communique said members depend largely on daily income from their services which have been adversely affected. “It is also inconceivable that fuel is sold at government recognised filling stations for between N350 to N400 per litre. “This has forced majority of our members to abandon their buses, motorcycles among others,” it added.
