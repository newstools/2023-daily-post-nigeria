Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court in Warri convicted three internet fraudsters, Onukwugha Favour, Lawrence David and Omoghan Destiny Igbinosa and sentenced them to prison. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, prosecuted them each on the charge of impersonation and obtaining by false pretence. The convict, Igbinosa, arraigned for impersonating Nollywood actor Ninalowo Bolanle in Benin City, Edo State sometime between 2021 and 2022, had fraudulently sent documents to Newon Quanon through the internet with intent to gain advantage for himself. The offence, contrary to Section 22 (2) (b) (i) of the Cybercrime (Prohibition Prevention, etc.) Act 2015, is punishable under Section 22(2) (b) (IV) of the same Act. The second convict, Favour, charged with the same offence, was found guilty of impersonating Mariah_1812, a United States citizen and sending documents to unsuspecting victims. The defendants pleaded guilty. Whilst prosecution counsel, I. M. Elodi prayed the court to convict and sentence them, defence counsels, A.J. Onwuanaje and Dickson Egberume pleaded with the court to temper justice with mercy. Justice Abang sentenced Igbinosa to two years imprisonment or a fine of N1 million while the defendant also forfeited the sum of $2,235 and his phone to the Federal Government. The duo of Favour and David also forfeited their phones while they were handed one-year imprisonment each or a fine of N500,000 and N200,000 respectively.
