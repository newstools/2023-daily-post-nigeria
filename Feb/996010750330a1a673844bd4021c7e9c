Former Manchester United striker, Louis Saha, has advised his former club against signing England World Cup stars, Mason Mount and Declan Rice. There are much speculation surrounding the futures of both Mount and Rice, who currently play for Chelsea and West Ham United, respectively. Both midfielders have just 17 months left on their current contracts with their club sides. The pair are reported to attract interest from Man United and Chelsea. “I don’t think he should move to [Manchester] United as he has not been playing well,” Saha told Lord Ping. “Mason Mount can fit in at any team, but I don’t think he is had a great year at Chelsea and I am not sure why he’d be linked more than he was before, seeing as he was on fire last year. “I think these rumours are coming from agents, and I am not going to blame the media, but moving for Mount isn’t the right call at the moment.” “It will take [Declan] Rice time to adjust to this level, but he’s a good player and could become it but, I don’t think United need him at the moment because we have sold this issue after such a long time,” he added. —
