Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has threatened to deal with the National and State Assembly candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state if they betray him and join those in Abuja, the Atiku Abubakar camp. Wike made the threat when he spoke during the state Peoples Democratic Party campaign rally in Obio/Akpor Local Government of Rivers State, the last campaign rally of the PDP in the state. He said, “All the other candidates, the Senatorial candidates, my Deputy Chairman, Doctor Ipalibo Harry-Banigo, Chief Allwell Onyeso and Barinada Mpigi, and all the House of Reps candidates and the Assembly candidates, let me tell you people, if any of them like, let them go to Abuja and misbehave, we will teach them lesson as we are teaching these other people now. “I want to sound it clear, all of them are listening to me, if they are not here, they are watching the television. If you follow this betrayal, we will place a course on you and you will suffer the way they are suffering, so if you have the mind to do that, be very very careful”. Wike has been at loggerheads with some PDP chieftains in the state, following their resolve to support the PDP Presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, after Wike lost to him at the party’s primaries last year.
