The Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, said its attention has been drawn to what it describes as a fraudulent and misleading information circulating on some social media platforms, insinuating there is a planned shutdown of all telecom networks and relevant ICT Units, including online transfer facilities of the banks, with effect from today, February 23, 2023. NCC advised all Nigerian public, consumers of telecommunications services, and all bank customers to ignore these or similar messages that insinuate deliberate network shutdown or disruption of services in the Nigerian telecom network. “These malicious and subversive messages originated and are being circulated by fraudsters and unscrupulous elements in the society with the intent to cause chaos and panic among the populace,” the commission said in a statement on Thursday. The commission said it has received unequivocal assurances from all the service providers to the effect that all the network services are currently in optimal performance, and will not witness any deliberate shutdown or disruptions, especially at this very crucial period of general elections in the country. “Therefore, all users of telecommunications and banking services utilizing network facilities are assured of continued optimal service delivery before, during, and after the general elections in Nigeria,” it said.
