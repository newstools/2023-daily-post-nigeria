Ahead of tomorrow’s presidential election, the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has allayed fears of network failure and hackers during Saturday’s poll. The Deputy Director of ICT, INEC, Lawrence Bayode made this disclosure on Friday in a Channels Television Interview monitored by DAILY POST. He assured that INEC had configured the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) seamlessly to avoid network failure. Bayode said that the INEC’s devices had been designed to guard against cyber hackers. “The commission is aware of hacking; we have done our best to protect our data and systems. Data at rest and data in transit are protected; Incase there is any successful cyber attack, we will have a failover”, he stated.
