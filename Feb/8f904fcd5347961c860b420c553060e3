Paris Saint-Germain are ready to take Thomas Tuchel back as their manager, according to RMC. Christophe Galtier is under pressure at the Parc des Princes as their season stutters. Zinedine Zidane is believed to be PSGâ€™s top candidate to replace Galtier, but Tuchel also has supporters inside the club. The former Chelsea manager is still out of job after he was fired by Todd Boehly in September. Tuchel was in charge of PSG for three seasons, before being infamously sacked on Christmas Eve 2020 by president Nasser Al-Khelaifi.
