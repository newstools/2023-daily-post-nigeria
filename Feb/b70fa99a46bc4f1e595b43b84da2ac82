The Movement for the Actualization of Sovereign State of Biafra, MASSOB, on Thursday, denied knowledge of a meeting held in Aba, Abia State, organized by Pro-Biafra agitators. The leadership of MASSOB made this known through a statement signed by its National Director of Information, Edeson Samuel and issued to newsmen in Abakaliki. The group dissociated itself from the acclaimed agitators, who according to reports, hide under the Pro-Biafra theme to cause mayhem to the citizens of the South East zone. The statement reads in part: “MASSOB was not part and will never be part of such meeting where faceless groups are hiding under Biafra to enrich themselves. We as one of the leading groups in the Biafra project know the real Biafra agitators and their leaders. “We have an umbrella that unites us called the coalition of Pro-Biafra agitators with the name known as Biafra National Council BNC. This is the only body that unites all the genuine pro-Biafra groups. The group also denied participation in the said meeting held by the agitators where Ndubuisi Igwekala was appointed the leader as well given the unknown gunmen ultimatum. “We believe in the non-violence approach and through consultation, and negotiation we can restore peace in Igbo land” the group stated.
