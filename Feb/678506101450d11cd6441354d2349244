The Zamfara State Governorship Campaign Council of the All Progressives Congress, APC has constituted a 25-member committee to handle the reception and coordination of those that are decamping to the party. This was disclosed by the Secretary General of the State Governorship Campaign Council and former Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Prof Abdullahi Muhammad Shinkafi. The constitution of the committee was necessitated by the increasingly overwhelming entrants into the APC from other political parties in the state, Shinkafi explained. “Recall that the APC has continuously received defectors since the commencement of the campaign, which further increased with the peace and unity attained by all members of the party in the state. “Zamfara people have also been faithful to the APC with the confidence they have in the Matawalle-led administration, especially in the fight against armed banditry, which hitherto threatened development in the State,” he stated. According to him, the 25-man committee has Senator Tijjani Yahaya Kaura and Mutakar Muhammad Rini as chairman and secretary, respectively.
