Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp, has blamed his players following his side’s Premier League 3-0 defeat to Wolves in Saturday’s Premier League tie. Klopp said that his players conceded two goals which they should have defended better against the hosts, adding that there was no excuse. Goals from Joel Matip (OG), Craig Dawson, and Ruben Neves gave Wolves all three points against Liverpool at Molineux Stadium. “Obviously, it was a horrible start,” Klopp told Premier League Productions. “Two goals which cannot happen like that. But it happened, and we were 2-0 down because of our own fault. “We should’ve defended better. We were passive in that period. I cannot explain it. There is no excuse for it. “You are 2-0 down, the crowd is there, but it opens up and we get some control. Then for about 45 minutes, we play a good away game without scoring. That sums it up pretty much.”
