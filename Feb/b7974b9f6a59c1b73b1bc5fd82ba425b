In a massive twist, Big Brother on Thursday night issued a new challenge that prevents communication between male and female housemates. Housemates of the opposite sex are not allowed to interact with each other until Biggie says otherwise. According to the twist, the men will only be able to communicate with other men and women with women. The guys and the girls have been split into two tribes who can only speak via a mediator nominated by each gender, Yaya and Miracle. The mediator can only speak for a certain number of times per day in squared off areas for a time period to be decided by Biggie. The twist also required that the housemates must change sleeping arrangements: females in one room (Alex), while the males in a different room (Sandton). No female must cook for the male housemates again and vice versa. They are not allowed to use the kitchen at the same time. Also, they must be separated during the use of the arena and party room. The housemates were subjected to the new twist from Biggie after the successful wager task presentation and after Nelisa, Blue Aiva, and Olivia broke one of Biggieâ€™s rules by engaging in a physical fight.
