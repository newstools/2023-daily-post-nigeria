Employment will me made available for every qualified citizen. “There will be no strike. We will make available education loans for indigent students and also facilitate the payment of student school fees.” While commending APC members for coming out to welcome him, Tinubu also hinted that he was set to replace the current administration of President Muhammadu Buhari because he was one of those who facilitated his coming to power in 2015.
