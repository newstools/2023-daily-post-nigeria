President Muhammadu Buhari has launched a 56-member National Advisory Committee on Women’s Economic Empowerment. The president established the High-Level Advisory Committee, H-LAC, to provide for the social and economic development of Nigerian women, especially in the face of failed attempts to pass gender-based laws in the country. Dr Judith-Ann Walker, a member of the committee, in a statement, said her team’s mandate involves redressing the political, social and economic imbalances faced by Nigerian women. The member disclosed that the committee has been set up to serve as a veritable bridge between administrations on key development issues affecting women and girls. ‘‘Girls’ education, technical and life skills, women’s economic empowerment as well as the Adolescent Girls Initiatives for Learning and Empowerment will form part of the key issues the committee will aim to resolve, said Walker. She said the committee established as a non-partisan advisory body, has representation from key government MDAs. ‘’Civil society organizations such as the development Research and Projects Center (dRPC) which is implementing the flagship Partnership for Advancing Women in Economic Development (PAWED), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, will bring technical expertise to the H-LAC’’. Walker further commended President Buhari and the Minister of Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen for setting up the committee which she said will bring inclusiveness in governance in Nigeria.
