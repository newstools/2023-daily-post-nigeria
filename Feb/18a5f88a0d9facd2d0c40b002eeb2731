A High Court Judge in Niger State, Justice Abdullahi Mikail has dismissed a suit challenging the appointment of Alh. Mohammed Barau Mua’zu as the 7th Emir of Kontagora in the state. Delivering his judgement, Justice Makail declared that the suit lacks merit and substantial evidence to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. He explained that the plaintiff failed completely to prove the case against the defendant as required by the law, and consequently, dismissed it for lack of merit after a three-hour judgement. Justice Mikail also noted that another issue was regarding the documents submitted by the complainant which the court was not satisfied with during the proceedings. Speaking shortly after the ruling, the counsels to the Emir expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the judgment, saying it was a well researched judgment. However, the counsel to the plaintiff Bar. Mika Anace, who appeared not satisfied with the court’s decision in his reaction, promised to appeal against it at the upper court.
