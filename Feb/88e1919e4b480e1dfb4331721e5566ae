The invisible Big Brother Titans instructor, Biggie, has punished two housemates, Nellisa and Yemi, for breaking some of the rules in the house. Recall that Yemi Cregx and Nelisa emerged as the week’s Tail of House, a title recently introduced as one of the many twists and additions to the BBTitans edition. For their rewards, they are required to wear the trademark tail and use a whiteboard to indicate when they want to speak. They, however, failed to follow the rules, and Biggie doesn’t like his rules being broken. Upon failing to comply by dressing as the tails of the house, Biggie decided to punish them. Consequently, they are to paint their canvases using only earbuds and must comply with all the painting rules.
