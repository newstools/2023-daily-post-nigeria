The All Progressives Congress (APC) has denied pushing for a postponement of the 2023 elections, saying its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu will win. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Felix Morka issued a rebuttal on Wednesday, describing a report of the alleged plot as “blatantly false and reckless”. Morka said the publication offers no substantive justifying content aside from “intended purpose of misleading and causing needless anxiety and speculations”. He described the election as a matter of extreme national importance bordering on national security and corporate integrity of Nigeria, which should not be subjected to “insensitive speculation by the media or any institution”. The APC said under President Muhammadu Buhari’s leadership, it continues to wage “the most extensive and vibrant campaign” for presidential candidate Bola Tinubu and his running mate, Senator Kashim Shettima. The ruling party said it’s in contrast to the incoherent campaign of opposition parties “that have placed nothing before the electorate except their vile merchandise of lies, innuendoes and hate propaganda against the APC”. The statement said the President has left no one in doubt as to his unshakable commitment to bequeathing a befitting legacy of credible, free and fair election. The APC told Nigerians that its government enacted unprecedented electoral reform and innovation that has placed our country in good stead to deliver 2023 polls and bolster democracy. “We stand ready for the general election, and remain confident that Nigerians will overwhelmingly renew our mandate in a peaceful, free and credible electoral contest”, Morka asserted.
