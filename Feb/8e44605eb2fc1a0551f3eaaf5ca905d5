The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Plateau State, Caleb Mutfwang has advised residents of the state not to insist on casting their votes when BVAS fails to accredit them during the 2023 elections. While noting that the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has deployed the BVAS technology to eliminate rigging and other electoral frauds, he stressed that the 2022 Electoral Act also empowered INEC to cancel election where there is over-voting. Mutfwang gave the advice while rounding off his political engagement across the 17 local government areas in Mangu LGA of the state. He urged residents to resist the temptation of selling their PVCs or allowing the opposition to pick their PVC numbers which can be cloned to disenfranchise them at the polls. “INEC has introduced BVAS machine to help eliminate rigging and double voting for the 2023 elections, but you should not insist on voting when the BVAS did not recognise you because it will amount to cancellation of the result in that polling unit,” he said. Mutfwang urged youths to shun violence and any act capable of undermining the success of the electoral process. Mutfwang urged the citizenry to vote massively for the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar and all of the party’s candidates to rebuild and unify Nigeria. Also speaking, the Director General of Atiku-Mutfwang Campaign Council, Latep Dabang said: “With Atiku Abubakar as President, Plateau will have free access to the presidency to attract developments and also unify the country.”
