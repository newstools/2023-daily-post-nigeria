Chelsea manager, Graham Potter, has said Enzo Fernandez might not play against Fulham on Friday night if he doesn’t get clearance from the Premier League. The Blues signed Fernandez from Benfica on deadline day for a British record fee of £107million. However, the World Cup winner arrived in the UK on Wednesday to finalize his transfer to Chelsea. Fernandez could now face a delay before he represents the Stamford Bridge club. “We’ve got to wait and see with the paperwork, to see if he gets the clearance. “I’ve spoken to him and although my Spanish isn’t great and his English isn’t great – we needed a translator, but we’ll get there. He’s an impressive young man. I’m excited to work with him,” Potter told reporters on Thursday.
