Deji Adeyanju, a socio-political activist, has unveiled a new strategy the All Progressives Congress, APC, reportedly plans to use to win the polls via vote-buying. Adeyanju disclosed that APC plans to write a list and account number of electorates and credit them directly at the polling units. He noted that the party intends to take advantage of the fact that the government would not shut down internet banking on election day. According to Adeyanju: “APC has perfected how to win the election through vote buying. They intend the write list and account number of voters and credit them directly at Polling Units. Is it possible to shut down internet banking on Election Day to protect the sanity of the ballot in the country?” Nigerians would file out at the polling units on February 25th to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice. APC’s presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, Peter Obi of the Labour Party, LP, and Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, are leading the pack of those slugging it out to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. As the date for the commencement of the election draws closer, the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, naira policy is believed to be aimed at tackling vote-buying.
