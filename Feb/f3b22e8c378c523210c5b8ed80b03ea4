The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu has declared that he would win the February 25th presidential election. Speaking at the palace of the Sultan of Sokoto, Sa’ad Abubakar III, Tinubu said he would win the presidential election because President Muhammadu Buhari was with him. According to Tinubu: “We are here to win the election and to seek your blessing. I have come here to pay homage and seek your blessing and endorsement, and I know you won’t reject [me] because the President and C-in-C is here with me. How can the President be here and you’ll reject me? “We are here to win the election, we are here to seek your blessings, and you cannot reject it.”
