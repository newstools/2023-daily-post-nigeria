Big Brother Titans reality TV show host Ebuka Obi Uchendu has questioned Khosi about her feelings for Yemi and Thabang. This is coming barely a week after Ebuka questioned Yemi Cregx for always leaving Khosi’s bed for Blue Aiva’s around 2 am. Ebuka, however, on Sunday during the live eviction show, turned his sights on Khosi, who appeared to be conflicted over her feelings for the duo. Ebuka queried Khosi about being 100% faithful and honest to Yemi, but she found it challenging to give a direct reply to him. Ebuka also revealed what Khosi told Thabang in secrecy about her affection towards him despite having something with Yemi. He said: “Don’t make this about Thabang. It is about how you feel about Thabang. You told Thabang when you were looking at him on Saturday that you weren’t hearing anything Yemi was saying because you were lost in his eyes.” Khosi, who tried to have a conversation with Yemi afterwards, asked: “Are you not going to say anything?” Yemi replied: “Nah, it’s alright. Just go do your thing.”
