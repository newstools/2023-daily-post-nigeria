Former Chelsea striker, Olivier Giroud, is reportedly open to a return to the English Premier League, EPL, next season and would prefer a move to a London club. Giroud is set to become a free agent in the summer when his contract with Serie A champions AC Milan comes to an end. The former Arsenal attacker has spent almost two years in Italy. According to the Sun, Giroud is already planning out his next move ahead of his deal finishing at AC Milan. The report claimed that Premier League clubs, West Ham, Crystal Palace, Brentford and Fulham are all potential options for the France international. Giroud scored 90 Premier League goals during his two stints in London with Chelsea and Arsenal, respectively.
