The Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai has accused the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, of knowing the individual elements in the Villa that are working against the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC’s victory in the 2023 presidential election. Recall that El-Rufai had earlier on Wednesday, alleged that some persons in the presidential Villa were working towards the failure of the party. Responding to him, the Information Minister while addressing the state house correspondents after the Federal Executive Council, FEC, meeting on Wednesday, noted that the Presidency is not aware of those in its fold working against the APC. The Governor, however, on Thursday, in an interview on Arise TV, insisted that even Lai Mohammed knows the individuals he is referring to in the Villa. He said, ”Let me restate exactly what I said. What I said was that we are convinced that there are elements in the Villa that want APC to lose the elections, I did not say the Federal government. I did not say Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. I said APC. So I don’t understand why the Federal government is responding to what I said because the Federal government is not part of it. I referred to elements in the Villa, and with the greatest respect, even Lai Mohammed knows who I am referring to.”
