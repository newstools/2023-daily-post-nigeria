Nigeria goalkeeper, Daniel Akpeyi has been granted a work permit to play for South African club Swallows FC. Akpeyi has been without a club since leaving another South African side, Kaizer Chiefs, in July 2022. The 38-year-old’s move to Swallows was delayed after the Dube Birds were hit with a transfer sanction by the Federation of International Football Federation (FIFA). The former Warri Wolves goalie, who has been training with Swallows FC for several months, is available for Ernst Middendorp’s side trip to his former club, Chippa United, on Sunday. The experienced shot-stopper could be handed his debut against the Chilli Boys. Swallows are third from bottom, tied with Maritzburg United on 21 points in the relegation play-off spot.
