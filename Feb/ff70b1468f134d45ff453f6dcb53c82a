Unknown gunmen operating in the South-East struck again on Friday, killing three policemen from the department of Explosive Ordinance Device, (EoD), Delta State Police Command, Asaba. The victims, who were attached to the State Government House, were murdered in Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State. The policemen were on their way to Abia State. They were an advance team of the governor, who is the Vice Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. The names of the three deceased police officers were given as Inspectors Lucky Aleh, Celestine Nwadiokwu and Jude Obuh. A source revealed that the unknown gunmen intercepted them at about 1.30pm at Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State and set their vehicle ablaze. It was reliably gathered that two of the killed police officers were indigenes of Agbor, Delta state. “Four officers were in the vehicle but one was on mufti (not on uniform) so he was freed while the three in uniform were killed. The Escort commander from the Government House, Asaba, was sent to bring their corpses and deposit them in a mortuary in Asaba,” a Government House source said. The Police Public Relations Officer, (PPRO), of Anambra State command, Ikenga Tochukeu, confirmed the incident. He disclosed that, “We got distress calls and we rushed to the scene of the incident. The policemen who were killed are from the Delta state command and were on transit as at the time of the incident. But I can assure you that the State commissioner of police, Anambra, is very poised to bring to book the criminals behind the dastardly act.”
