The Yola South Local Government Area officials of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Friday said it has suspended the Adamawa State Governorship candidate of the party, Senator Aishatu Ahmed Binani. But barely an hour after Binani’s ‘suspension’ became public, the state executive committee of the party rose against the local council officials, claiming the said suspension was sponsored nonsense. The APC Yola South local government area had said in a statement that it suspended Binani for six months “over her failure to appear before its Disciplinary Committee to defend some allegations levelled against her.” In the statement issued Friday and signed by 21 executive members of the party in the Yola South LGA, the local party officials said the suspension was with immediate effect. The statement said the party in the LGA received a petition against Binani from a member of the party from Bako Ward, Auwal HammaAdama Bawuro, accusing Binani of causing disunity among party members. It said the suspension of Binani followed a resolution of the Yola South LGA Committee over her failure to appear before the committee to defend herself. In its counter statement, however, the leadership of the APC at the state level described the purported suspension as callous, unguided, divisive and diversionary. The statement, signed by the state APC Secretary, Dr Raymond Chidama said the suspension drama could not emanate from members of the party and urged loyal members to disregard it. “The attention of the members of the state working committee was drawn to a publication purporting suspension of the Governorship Candidate of our party, APC Distinguished Sen Aishatu Dahiru Binani. “We want to unequivocally state that this is unconstitutional, null and void and is of no effect,” the state Exco stated.
