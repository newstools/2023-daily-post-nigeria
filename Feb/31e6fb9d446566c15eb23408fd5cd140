It was a dramatic moment in the Big Brother Titans house as two housemates, Jenni O and Khosi, broke one of Biggie’s rules after engaging in a physical altercation on Monday night. The fight, which caused all the housemates to interfere, started with a verbal exchange between the duo. It all started when Khosi was playing cards upstairs, and Thabang decided to go talk to her. Nana, who already feels Thabang‘s closeness to Khosi was the reason they had been twice nominated for eviction in a row, joked about his movement. Apparently, this was already not sitting well with Khosi, who rushed down to confront Nana in a way Jenni O didn’t like. Just as Jennie O rushed to Nana’s aide, Miracle also moved to the scene to protect his partner, Khosi. Video Link:
