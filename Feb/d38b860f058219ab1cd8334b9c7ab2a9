A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Adamu Garba has accused the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi, of playing a dangerous religious game in the Northern part of the country. He claimed that the LP candidate is working to divide the Muslims and the Christians. Garba also said Obi was pushing a very dangerous agenda capable of affecting the whole country. The accusation was contained in a post via his verified Twitter handle on Tuesday. He said this had been the game of former president Olusegun Obasanjo for a long time. Garba said the North is a United Muslim and Christian domain, noting that Obi can’t divide them. He wrote, “Peter Obi is playing a dangerous religious game in the North. All his recent Northern tours are targeted at predominantly Christian areas. He needs to know that he cannot export his IPOB games to the North. “The North is a United Muslims and Christian domain. He can’t divide us. “He and his cohorts, in addition to his collaborators, cannot set us against one another. This has been the game of Obasanjo for a long time. “He tried it for 8 years and could not succeed, he attempted to use Jonathan but failed. Now it is Peter Obi, we know and we’ll not accept this.
If you want to be a president, go everywhere. But we noticed whatever games Obi is playing. “He went to Kano, visited Sabon Gari, without homage to Emirs, went to Kaduna, neglected the Emir of Zazzau, went to Yola, didn’t visit Lamido or Mubi Emir. It has been the trend. Divisions! “Peter Obi is pushing a very dangerous agenda that is capable of affecting the whole country. We can’t allow that to happen. “Nigerians need to see the games in plain sight. This is a very bad precedent. “He is working to divide the Muslims and Christians. It is not acceptable.”
