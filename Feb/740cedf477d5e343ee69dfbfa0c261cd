Manchester City striker, Erling Haaland could quit the club next summer after they were hit with over 100 charges relating to their finances, TeamTalk reports. The Premier League made the announcement on Monday, with the charges against City from 2009 to 2018. If found guilty, champions face anything from fines to expulsion from the top flight. Indeed, the accusations have allegedly led to major problems behind the scenes at City. Manager Pep Guardiola also said that he would “quit” if the club’s hierarchy “lied” to him about their finances. Haaland has already scored 25 goals in 20 league appearances this season and is looking set to break Alan Shearer and Andy Cole’s joint record of 34 goals in a single Premier League campaign.
