The police have detained the presiding pastor of House on The Rock in Abuja, Pastor Uche Aigbe, for carrying an AK-47 to the pulpit. The Intelligence Response Team, IRT, under the Force Intelligence Bureau, FIB, took Aigbe into custody. The police commenced an investigation after a video circulated on social media. The cleric is seen preaching in church on Sunday while carrying the rifle on his left shoulder. It was gathered that one Inspector Musa Audu handed his service weapon to Aigbe. The officer will face an orderly room trial. Commissioner of Police, Federal Capital Territory Command, Sadiq Abubakar wants Audu dismissed for the misconduct. The CP has made a formal recommendation to the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba. The security agency is expected to provide an update on the matter.
