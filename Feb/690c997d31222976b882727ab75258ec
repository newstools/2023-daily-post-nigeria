The administrative secretary of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, in Kaduna State, Auwal Mashi, has dispelled fears that elections might be cancelled in nine local government areas of the state due to security challenges and scarcity of fuel. He gave the assurances in a meeting with traditional rulers and representatives of all political parties across the state in a meeting on Thursday. INEC, he said, is committed to free, fair and credible elections in the state and advised voters to get prepared to vote for the candidate of their choice without fear, while also urging them not to sell their voters cards to politicians. “Selling of voters card for material gains or for any reason by anybody must have done that [to] his or her detriment by only disenfranchising him[self] or herself from participating in the election process,” he said. The INEC secretary also explained that elections in the state are expected to be conducted in 8,012 polling units, adding that funds for logistics are already in the coffer of the Commission in preparation for a hitch-free election in the state.
