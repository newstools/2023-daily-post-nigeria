The gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Plateau State, Caleb Mutfwang has rebutted Governor Simon Lalong’s allegations of unpaid salaries levelled against him during his tenure as chairman of Mangu Local Government Area of the state. DAILY POST recalls that Lalong had on Wednesday during a rally at Wase LGA, accused Mutfwang of leaving behind 10 months’ salary arrears during his tenure as local government chairman. Mutfwang, while addressing a mammoth crowd in Wase Local Government Area during a town hall meeting, said: “Yesterday the Governor of Plateau State was in Wase and he did not have anything to campaign on, except telling lies against Caleb Mutfwang. “I want to challenge Governor Lalong in the same Wase, that if he is not a coward, let him produce the documents that prove that I did not pay salaries for 10 months as local government chairman. “Let me inform you that I have instructed my lawyers to take action, he will be hearing from my lawyers very soon if he does not refute that allegation, we will meet in court. “He should remember that his immunity expires on the 29th of May, thereafter, he will have no hiding place.” Mutfwang explained that the Local Government Service Commission under Mr Fabian Ntung, the current Chairman of Plateau State Independent Electoral Commission (PLASIEC) was responsible for the payment of local government workers in the 17 LGAs when he was chairman of Mangu LGA. He noted that Lalong who is a lawyer had unlawfully removed elected council chairmen who were only a year and three months in office in their three-year tenure and is still owing him (Mutfwang) and other chairmen two months’ salary arrears. Should he win the election, Mutfwang assured the citizenry of competent leadership, security and good governance where the welfare of citizens and civil servants would be given topmost priority.
