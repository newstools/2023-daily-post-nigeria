President Muhammadu Buhari at the weekend condemned the attack on vigilantes at Yargoje forest in Kankara Local Government Area of Katsina, where many lives were lost. DAILY POST reports that the Police Command in Katsina State had on Friday confirmed the death of 41 members of local vigilance groups, “Yansakai”, in an ambush by terrorists in Yargoje forest. The terrorists ambushed a convoy of vigilantes in the forest as they went to recover stolen cows leading to the killings. Reacting, Buhari paid tribute to all those vigilantes and family members who have been martyred, saying that the sacrifices of the brave men who are working to stop and punish crime in their communities will not be forgotten. This was disclosed in a statement issued by Buhari’s media aide, Garba Shehu, on Sunday. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved families in this difficult period. May Allah repose the soul of the deceased,” the President said.
