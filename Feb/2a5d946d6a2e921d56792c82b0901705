Argentina goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez, has identified France’s forward, Kylian Mbappe, as the player that will win many Ballon d’Or when Lionel Messi finally retires from playing professional football. Martinez, 30, recently came under the scanner for his behaviour towards Mbappe after Argentina won the 2022 FIFA World Cup final against France. Many believed the Aston Villa keeper was disrespectful in his public mocking of Mbappe. However, Martinez has now insisted that he had nothing personal against the Paris Saint-Germain star, insisting that he respects him a lot. “The locker room thing is a locker room thing. When France beat us in 2018, there were chants about Messi. If a team beats Brazil, they will sing about Neymar. I have nothing personal against Mbappé. I respect him enormously,” Martinez said (via GOAL). “There is nothing personal against Mbappe. I respect him a lot. If people sing about him or Neymar, it is because they are top players. After the final, I told him that it was a pleasure to play against him and that he almost won the match on his own… I had confirmation that he has immense talent. When Messi retires, I’m sure Kylian will win many Ballon d’Or awards.”
