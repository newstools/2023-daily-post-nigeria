The Concerned Stakeholders Forum of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has echoed Governor Nasir El-Rufai’s claim of saboteurs in the Buhari administration. First Lady Aisha Buhari, who years ago alerted Nigerians of a cabal around her husband, shared a video of El-Rufai’s rant. The Kaduna helmsman this week stated that elements in the presidency were working against the APC ahead of the 2023 general elections. At a news conference on Saturday in Abuja, Convener of the forum, Dominic Alancha, agreed certain individuals were sabotaging the government’s efforts. Alancha noted that some appointees have become the biggest disasters and saboteurs of the current administration, NAN reports. He said an appointee refused to make board appointments that could have gone to party followers three years after Buhari’s directive. “The man has done nothing of the sort, eliciting the anger of party faithful especially the younger members,” he said. Alancha also accused heads of agencies of employing their friends and allies to head different departments. Some ministers, he added, allocated themselves positions in parastatals and assigned them to whoever they chose. Alancha said most ministers were only interested in promoting themselves and their kinsmen instead of the party and government. The member criticized the National Working Committee (NWC) regarding accountability and reward of loyal party members. Alancha complained faithful have been defecting to opposition parties since the 2022 primaries while major stakeholders are alienated. Commending the governors for insisting on a power shift to the South, he condemned their “high handedness”, which caused “disfiguration of the growth of the party” in states.
