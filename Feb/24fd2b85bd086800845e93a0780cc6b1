A Chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in Warri South Local Government Area of Delta State, Victor Umukoro has said he and others like him would destroy the party and rebuild it for a better Nigeria. He was addressing the Delta South Senatorial candidate of the New Nigerian People’s Party, NNPP, Omatseye Nesiama at a town hall meeting organized by the NNPP in Warri. He said, “I am a PDP member. I am a member of the PDP that’s my saying enough is enough. We will destroy this PDP and rebuild the PDP for a new Nigeria. The former Council Chairmanship aspirant in Warri South Local Government Council said some members of the party are angry because of the dirty politics allegedly played in the party. “They tell you Oga done talk. The system has spoken. We are tired. We will put an end to it.” Umukoro said it is people like Omatseye Nesiama who are well trained and well travelled that they need as representatives. “For the cause of this election, I am not a party man. Am an observer.” Umukoro, however, complained that they’re politically backward in Essi layout in Warri, appealing to the people of the area not to be afraid of any intimidation during the forthcoming election but to come out en mass and vote for Omatseye Nesiama. Earlier, Omatseye Nesiama affirmed that he was still in the race and that there is no going back, vowing that he is ready to work and make a difference at the Senate.
