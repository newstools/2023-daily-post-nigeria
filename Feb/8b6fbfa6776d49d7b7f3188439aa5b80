Manchester United star, Casemiro, received a straight red card during his side’s Premier League 2-1 win against Crystal Palace on Saturday. Casemiro grabbed Will Hughes by the throat, leading to the Brazilian getting sent off in the 70th minute of the encounter. However, Manchester United goalkeeper, David de Gea, has now reacted hilariously on Twitter to the decision after the game. De Gea brought back an iconic Jose Mourinho catchphrase to express his feelings about the situation. The Spain international, who played under Mourinho during the Portuguese’s time at Old Trafford, posted a gif of that comment, with the caption: “I prefer not to speak. If I speak I am in big trouble.”
