Barely a week before the February 25 presidential and National Assembly elections, two senatorial candidates in Ogun East have dumped their political parties and defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC. The defectors, Dayo Ogunjebe of the Action Alliance, AA, and Mrs Funmilayo Idris of the Action Democratic Party, ADP, said they stepped down for the former governor. The two candidates announced their defection at a mega rally held by Daniel at the premises of Ijebu-Ode Local Government Secretariat, Itoro, Ijebu-Ode, to close his campaign for the 2023 polls. Speaking on why they withdrew from the senatorial race, both Ogunjebe and Idris said they decided to team up with Daniel whom they described as “the best man for the job.” According to them, the APC senatorial candidate has the capacity, track record, rich experience and other qualities required to effectively represent Ogun East at the National Assembly. The AA candidate said Daniel remains tested and trusted and should be supported by all well-meaning people. On her part, the ADP candidate explained that wherever she went for campaigns, she was always told by voters that only Daniel would have their votes in the election. Idris said she, therefore, shelved her ambition and decided to mobilise support for the APC senatorial candidate. Subsequently, Ogunjebe and Idris were officially received into the APC alongside their supporters by the party’s South West Zonal Woman Leader, Mrs Yetunde Adesanya, who promised that the defectors would be integrated and given a sense of belonging.
