Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has berated his players for missing “too many clear chances” as they drew 1-1 at Nottingham Forest on Saturday. The Premier League champions dropped two points at the Forest Ground in what is becoming a thrilling title race. Bernardo Silva opened the scoring for City, before Chris Wood grabbed a late equalizer. The home side needed Keylor Navas to tip De Bruyne’s fizzing free-kick over the upright, before Guardiola’s over-enthusiastic display of frustration on the sidelines was punished with a yellow card. “We have to look at ourselves – we can do better. Today we miss too many clear chances. It sometimes happens,” Guardiola said. “I was complaining to the fourth official and got a well deserved yellow card,” he added.
