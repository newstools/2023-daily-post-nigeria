The Yobe State All Progressives Congress (APC) Campaign Council, on Sunday, denied news reports of an attack on Governor Mai Mala Buni in the Gashua Local Government Area of the State. Reports had emerged that Buni was stoned by some irate youths during a rally in Gashua town on Saturday. The Campaign Director-General (DG), Sen. Mohammed Hassan, made the rebuttal at a press conference in Damaturu. He said, “there was nothing like stoning as reported by a section of the media. “I can tell you that the turnout at the rally was unprecedented, and people from all over came to support the party, our governor and his achievements.” Also speaking, Mamman Mohammed, Director-General of Press and Media Affairs to Buni, stated that he needed to respond to the “false, alarming and precarious report to avoid misleading the general public”.
