The presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, Rabiu Kwankwaso, has cautioned Nigerians against voting for candidates playing the ethnic card. Kwankwaso said Nigerians should not vote along ethnic or religious lines. He urged Nigerians to vote for candidates with the capacity and not candidates playing ethnic card. The NNPP presidential candidate spoke at his parley with the South West Development Stakeholders Forum in Ibadan, Oyo State. According to Kwankwaso: “Nigerians should not play politics of ethnicity and religion, vote only credible and competent leaders. “Some people don’t even understand the realities on the ground today. Every Nigerian is looking for a way out. Nobody is waiting for a neighbour or any leader to say this is the way. “Any party or candidate that comes out in the face of ethnicity or with the issue of religion, that party or candidate at the national level has failed in the election even before it starts.”
