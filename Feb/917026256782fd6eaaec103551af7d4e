Former Vice President of Nigeria and presidential candidate of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar has assured that his government will allocate ten billion dollars towards youth empowerment and their education. He stated this at UJ Esuene Stadium Calabar, when he addressed mass rally of PDP supporters and members ahead of the presidential election. He said, if voted into power, security and the two items will be the priority of his government. Atiku said, “We’ll allocate $10billion for the education of our youths and empower them with skills thereby eliminating poverty and criminality. With this, jobs shall be created and insecurity in the country shall reduce drastically.” He said it was becoming a reality that the country would not move forward with the current political situations. Atiku, therefore, promises his government will certainly restructure the country, adding that this would be treated as a major policy thrust of his administration. “We shall move to restructure the country as a major policy of the incoming PDP government by reducing the powers of the federal government and giving them to the states and local governments, so that we will hold all our leaders from all tiers of government responsible for development. “This will make the Federal Government less powerful and then a greater powers and resources will be deployed to the state for the good of our people,” he stated. “Let me also assure you that with the PDP in charge, your agricultural produce shall have value with road network to ready markets will be a priority and Nigeria and people of Cross River State shall smile again.” He noted that Nigerians have suffered for eight years now owing to incompetence of the ruling party. Speaking earlier, National Chairman of the party, Iyorchia Ayu, called on the people of the state to vote for PDP in order to reclaim their “stolen” mandate.
