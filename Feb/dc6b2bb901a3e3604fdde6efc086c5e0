Bayern Munich manager, Julian Nagelsmann, has singled out two Paris Saint-Germain stars, Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe, for praise, insisting that the Parisians are a better team with the duo playing in their ranks. Nagelsmann spoke ahead of Bayern Munich’s Champions League round of 16 first-leg tie with PSG on February 14. Both Messi and Mbappe are doubtful for the Champions League tie in Paris after sustaining fitness issues. “There’s a lot of pressure on both teams. PSG are better with Messi and Mbappe than without them, but they also have good replacements,” Nagelsmann said (h/t PSG Report). “They have a deep squad. I will prepare the team as if they were playing.” Mbappe has been out of action since February 4 as he sustained a hamstring injury against Montpellier, while Messi is suffering from overload in his hamstring.
