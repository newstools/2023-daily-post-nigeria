Popular Nigerian singer Seun Kuti has stated that he was a fool when he campaigned for the former governor of Lagos State, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in 1999. Seun stated this in a trending video shared on his Instagram page to address his alleged support for the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC. Seun, who is the youngest son of the Afrobeat pioneer, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, said he was “young and naïve” when he campaigned for Tinubu, the then-Lagos governor. He said: “I campaigned for Tinubu in 1999 because I knew him with my late father. I did Yoruba politics. Yoruba would be free from Nigeria because I was a fool in those days. I was young. I believed in what I could see. “I didn’t just stay in that position of privilege thinking that yes, I have arrived because I know Tinubu. I continued to study, learn and develop my political consciousness. “If truly we are all looking for the best way to be, then we must continue in a certain way to work and be better knowledgeable. So, as I continued to study, the more evidence in front of me proved to me that these politicians were not what they claimed to be. “I stepped away immediately I discovered that what was happening there was false and selfish because it no longer matches my political consciousness.”
