The Upper Area Court 4 in Yola, Adamawa State, has sentenced a 21-year-old man to seven years imprisonment for phone snatching. The sentence comes without an option of fine. The presiding judge of the court, Ibrahim Ulenda, convicted and sentenced the defendant, Abdulaziz Yusuf, who had pleaded guilty to the charge against him. Abdulaziz Yusuf was earlier arraigned before the court by the Prosecutor, Sergent Kabiru Abubakar of the Nigeria Police after he was said to have forcefully collected a phone from a student. Facts on the matter indicated that he had earlier in the month, on February 3, stormed Doubeli Secondary School, located in Yola North Local Government Area and threatened a student, identified as Aliyu Isa, with a knife and snatched his handset valued at N6, 500. The victim had raised an alarm which attracted other students who pursued and apprehended the convict while he was trying to escape from the school premises. He was later handed over to the nearby Doubeli Divisional Police headquarters which investigated and charged him to court. At the court, Abdulaziz owned up to the offence, after which the Prosecutor called a witness, a student of the Doubeli Secondary School, who corroborated the convictâ€™s guilty plea. The court thereafter handed him a prison term of seven years with no option of fine.
