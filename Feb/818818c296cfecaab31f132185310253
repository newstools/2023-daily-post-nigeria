Olakunle Churchill has given ex-wife, actress Tonto Dikeh 24 hours to retract defamatory posts against him or face a lawsuit. Olakunle made the threats on Tuesday in a legal document put out by his lawyers over their ongoing altercation on social media. According to his counsel, among the allegations is the claim that Churchill is a “fraudster, thief, blackmailer, and irresponsible father. False statements have been made public to tarnish our client’s image all because of the simple fact that the romantic relationship between you and our client came to an end. “You have continuously defamed our client and shared false information/accusations on the YouTube Platform to make money at our client’s expense.” Recall that Tonto Dikeh had a few days ago on her Instagram page slammed Churchill for celebrating their son on his 7th birthday to give the impression of trying to be in the child’s life. The duo have since then been in a social media battle, with both parties flooding their social media pages with shreds of evidence against each other.
