Premier League forward, Wilfried Zaha, is set for a shock move to join former Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo at Al-Nassr. Zaha, who currently plays for Crystal Palace in the Premier League, is considering a move to Saudi Arabia. The Ivorian has entered the final six months of his contract with Palace and has turned down several offers to extend his contract at Selhurst Park. There is a growing expectation that the 30-year-old will leave south London at the end of the season. AC Milan are interested in his services while he has long been linked with a move to Premier League leaders Arsenal. However, according to the Evening Standard, Zaha is open to a move to Al-Nassr, who signed Ronaldo in January and have already approached the player. The report added that Al-Nassrâ€™s rivals Al-Hillal and Al-Ittihad are also considering moves for Zaha when he becomes a free agent in the summer.
