The Christian leaders of Nigeria have expressed discontent over the Independent National Electoral Commission’s refusal to shift ground on upload of Saturday’s general elections on its result portal. The Convener of the group, Rev Williams Okoye and other leaders disclosed this to DAILY POST on Tuesday. The group was reacting to the call by some critical stakeholders on the INEC Chairman, Prof Yakubu Mahmood, to cancel the election due to his refusal to upload results electronically. They stated INEC’s failure to upload the election result on its results portal contradicts the Electoral Act. “We are shocked that many hours after a National election, INEC could not transmit the results as required. It is in addition to many other fundamental breaches of the electoral law, including late commencement of voting across the country, non-voting in polling units, and widespread reports of logistic failure as highlighted by foreign and domestic observers.”
