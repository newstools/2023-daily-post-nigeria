Chelsea legend, Frank Leboeuf, has hit out at the club’s decision to sell ‘useless’ midfielder Jorginho to rivals Arsenal during the January transfer window. Leboeuf claimed that Jorginho is useful for Arsenal but not useful for Chelsea, adding that the Italy international was a leader in the midfield when he was at Stamford Bridge. Recall that Jorginho headed to the Emirates on transfer deadline day for £12 million. The 31-year-old has been impressive for Arsenal since joining the Gunners. Jorginho was instrumental in Arsenal’s last-gasp Premier League 4-2 victory over Aston Villa on Saturday. That victory has kept Arsenal’s hopes of winning the title alive as they sit on top of the Premier League table with two points ahead of second-placed Manchester City. Meanwhile, Chelsea are enduring a contrasting season with Arsenal as they sit in 10th position. Graham Potter’s side trail Arsenal by 23 points following their 1-0 home shock defeat to Southampton on Saturday. And Leboeuf has now criticised the lack of leadership now in the Chelsea dressing room following Jorginho’s departure. “I don’t see any players with leadership. They are all 20-21 years old, they have great futures. We saw that today with Jorginho and Arsenal. It is crazy that I have to say that Jorginho was very useless for Chelsea but so useful for Arsenal,” Leboeuf told ESPN. “We have to find leaders in the middle of the park or in the spine, which we don’t have at Chelsea. Nobody is a leader.”
