Liverpool legend, Jamie Carragher, has told Newcastle United what they must do to beat Manchester United in Sunday’s Carabao Cup [EFL Cup] final. Newcastle will take on Man United in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday evening at Wembley Stadium. But Carragher wants Newcastle United to start the game strong in order to take advantage of the Man United players’ tired legs. “The fact that Manchester United played on Thursday night and have played a lot of games – if I was Eddie Howe [Newcastle manager], I would be saying, ‘You have got to start this game as if there is only half an hour left’,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “You have just got to go for it. Try and make this game as fast and as intense as you possibly can right from the start. You have to start quick and really go after Manchester United.” He added: “They [Newcastle] are a tough nut to crack. They have got to go there with energy and belief.”
