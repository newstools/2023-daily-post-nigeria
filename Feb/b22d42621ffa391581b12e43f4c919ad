The senator representing Kogi West, Smart Adeyemi, has declared his intention to contest for the Kogi State governorship seat on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC. Speaking with the journalists in Abuja on Monday after purchasing his expression of interest and nomination forms at the party secretariat, the senator noted that he has the requisite experience to govern the state. While expressing his willingness to fight for the survival of the less privileged in society, Adeyemi said: “I am going to contest the Kogi State governorship race. I have enough experience of what governance should be and have challenges of governance. I have been lucky to represent my state in the senate three times. “I have the courage to lead and fight for the survival of the less privileged. To my credit, I am one of the lawmakers that have sponsored the highest number of bills passed into law. “I’m exposed enough to give our people the best. In politics, people contest for varied interests. Some other aspirants have also collected the form, but I’m the aspirant to beat as far as required support and goodwill in the state are concerned.” Adeyemi, who is presently serving a third term as senator, was first elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, for two terms and the third on the platform of the APC. Abdulkarim Asuku, chief of staff to the state governor Yahaya Bello, and a serving house of representatives member, James Faleke, are said to be interested in running for office.
