President Muhammadu Buhari met with security chiefs on Wednesday, ahead of the Saturday presidential election. The National Security Council, comprising the National Security Adviser, NSA, Ministers of Defence and Interior, and heads of all security agencies in the country including the Army, Navy, Airforce and Police, among others, met to review ongoing arrangements that have been adopted to ensure hitch-free nationwide elections on Saturday. The security council meeting was preceded by the launch of security equipment donated by the Coalition Against Covid-19 (CACOVID) at the councilâ€™s chamber, Abuja. Although the leadership of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, had expressed concerns over attacks on its facilities in the South East and a pocket of other issues, security agencies have repeatedly given assurance of their readiness to provide adequate protection during the electioneering process.
