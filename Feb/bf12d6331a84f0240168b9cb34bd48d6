The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has spoken on the fate of the Labour Party, whose candidate for the Enugu East senatorial district election, Prof. Oyibo Chukwu, was murdered on Wednesday evening. Chukwu was killed three days before the presidential and National Assembly elections. DAILY POST learnt that he was set ablaze alongside other party members late Wednesday evening at Amaechi Awkunanaw, Enugu South Local Government Area of Enugu State. Unidentified persons were said to have accosted them while riding in a Sienna vehicle and set the vehicle ablaze. About five persons were reportedly affected. Responding to a question of what becomes of the Labour Party following Chukwu’s death, INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said: “If the senatorial candidate of one of the political parties has passed on and the party is asking for a postponement of the election, what is the position of the law? “The law is very clear on what should be done. The law provides for countermanding the election in the constituency where the political party has lost a candidate but wishes to continue to participate in the election. But, as we speak, the Commission has not received any official notification from the political party. “As soon as the Commission received official information and it is satisfied with the cause of death, it would apply the provisions of the law.”
