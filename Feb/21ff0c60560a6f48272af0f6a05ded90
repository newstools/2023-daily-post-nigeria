Former Manchester United forward Robin Van Persie has praised Bruno Fernandes’ selfless displays on the wing in recent weeks. Erik Ten Hag has increasingly used Fernandes off the flank, with January signing Wout Weghorst as a number 10 in recent matches. However, that system nearly backfired during their Europa League playoff second leg against Barcelona on Thursday, with the Spanish side taking the lead on the night and Weghorst was withdrawn at half-time. The Portuguese midfielder was restored to his normal central midfield position after half-time, and he quickly created United’s first goal for Fred. The Red Devils grabbed their second goal from Antony’s boots to earn a 2-1 (4-3 aggregate) victory against the La Liga giants. And Van Persie, who played for Arsenal and Manchester United, hailed the Portugal international for persevering with the selfless role regardless. “It shows as well that Fernandes plays on the wing and great players do that for the team,” Van Persie told BT Sport after the game. “It’s like when you are a great player, you are a team player. When the team needs you on the wing, then he does that.”
