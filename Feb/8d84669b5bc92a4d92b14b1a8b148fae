Kaduna State Urban Planning and Development Agency (KASUPDA), has denied reports that the state government ordered the demolition of banks that failed to comply with the directive to accept the old N500 and N1,000 from customers in the state. Governor Nasir El-Rufai, had, in a broadcast on Thursday last week asked residents to stay calm and peaceful and support the lawful means being utilised to solve the cash scarcity challenge, assuring they would not lose their money. El-Rufai had said, “Let no artificial deadline frighten you. Whether you live in towns, villages or in our isolated rural communities, do not feel stampeded to deposit your old notes in the banks. Hold on to them. Continue to use them as legal tender as ordered by the Supreme Court of Nigeria.” However, on Monday afternoon, news emerged that the Governor had ordered banks to be marked for demolition, with trucks stationed in from of the banks. But checks by DAILY POST revealed that the social media post appeared to be false. A source at the Kaduna State Urban Planning Development Agency, KASUPDA told our reporter during inquiries that there was no directive from the state government to demolish any bank. ”There is no instruction to bring down any bank that refuses to comply with the order asking banks to accept old naira notes from customers in the state. “It was last year that those operating commercial businesses were asked to come and settle their ground rents, banks were not even included in the directive.” Our correspondent who went round the city centre in Kaduna reports that no banks were marked for demolition and no trucks are stationed in front of any bank.
