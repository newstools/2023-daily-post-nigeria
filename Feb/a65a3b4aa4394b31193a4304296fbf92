Etigwe Uwa has expressed optimism that he will soon be declared the rightful governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, and would proceed to win the Abia State governorship election on March 11, 2023. Uwa, who challenged the candidature of Prof Greg Ibe who was declared guber candidate of APGA in Abia State, in an interview said the Federal High Court in Abuja has nullified all prayers against him, and that his own prayers to the court were upheld after all arguments have been taken. Uwa, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, further claimed that a new date would soon be announced for another governorship primary election to determine the rightful candidate. “Despite all the litigations and antics to limit or discourage my ambition, I will continue to tell Abia [people] that our state needs capable hands to harness her potential for greatness,” he said stressing that his billboards are everywhere, which is an indication that he was already campaigning.
