With three days to the general election, sensitive materials that will be used for the polls have been deployed in Ondo State. The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, in the state, distributed the materials across the 18 local governments for the Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections. The materials, which were kept with the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, in the state were distributed to the electoral officers after they handed over to the Acting Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Mr. Oyekola Oyelami. The distribution was done in the presence of political party representatives, journalists as well as security agents. While distributing the materials, the Acting REC, assured that the materials will be given maximum security to the local government headquarters in the state. Oyelami disclosed that Bimodal Voter Accreditation Systems, BVAS, was also equally distributed to the council areas at the INEC office in Akure. The Acting REC, disclosed that the deployment of the materials will not be hampered with the fuel and naira scarcity in the country. “We have enough fuel and vehicles to take the materials to the 18 Local Government Areas of Ondo State. “So, as we speak, our electoral officers are at the local governments to receive the materials.”
