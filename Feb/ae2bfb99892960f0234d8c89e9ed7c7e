Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has confirmed that four key players will miss his side’s Premier League tie with Newcastle United on Saturday. Liverpool will tackle Newcastle United in an away Premier League tie at St. James’ Park. The Reds head to the game following a 2-0 win over Everton in their last game. However, Liverpool will be without the likes of Thiago Alcantara, Luis Diaz, Ibrahima Konate and Calvin Ramsey as Klopp issued an injury update in his press conference ahead of the Newcastle tie. Speaking to the press, the German said (via Liverpool Echo): “Same squad as Monday night. Ibou [Konate] not yet, Luis [Diaz] not yet. But that’s it pretty much. “Nothing happened on the injury side. Thiago [Alcantara] out. Calvin [Ramsay] had surgery, not available.”
