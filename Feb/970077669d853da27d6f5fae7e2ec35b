Kaduna State chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Felix Hassan Hyat, has called on all eligible voters to collect their Permanent Voter’s Cards (PVCs). He made the call on Friday via a statement issued by Abraham Alberah Catoh, publicity secretary of the party. While noting that the extension of the deadline for the collection of PVCs by INEC was in good faith, he appealed to all registered voters in the state to get their PVCs before the expiration date. DAILY POST recalls that the INEC has extended the collection of PVCs to February 5, 2023. Reminding the electorate that only those with PVC would be allowed to vote during the election, Hyat said: “The party also encouraged all and sundry to make the exercise a civic responsibility to enable them to exercise their franchise during the 2023 general elections.” The statement while decrying the low turnout of PVCs collection across the state further noted: “The monetary policy of currency redesign without the availability of the new notes and long queues at filling stations across the country due to lack of petrol, is a major factor to this effect, aside other factors. “Our people must understand that the PVC is their trump card to the enthronement of a desired and right political leadership at all strata of government, and the importance of the 2023 general elections cannot be overemphasised.”
