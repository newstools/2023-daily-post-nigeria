The leadership of Nigeria Police and Nigerian Army in Lagos State met on Thursday over the death of a soldier in Ikorodu. Police Public Relations Officer, SP Benjamin Hundeyin posted photos of the parley on Twitter. CP Idowu Owohunwa and Brigadier General IA Akpaumontia of 9 Brigade met in the office of Lt Col. MI Abdurrahman, Commanding Officer, 174 Battalion, Odoguyan. On Wednesday, an angry mob at Ogijo community, a border town between Ogun and Lagos, attacked a police station following the soldierâ€™s demise. The deceased had confronted a policeman standing close to a patrol vehicle of Operation MESA to confirm his identity. This led to an argument which resulted in the policeman allegedly stabbing the soldier, leaving a serious wound. The soldier was rushed to the Lagos State Polytechnic Hospital, Odogunyan, where he was declared dead on arrival. The remains have been moved to 174 Battalion Medical Centre in Ikorodu. An investigation is expected to commence soon.
