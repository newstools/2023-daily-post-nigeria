The Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, CPPE, has asked the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN and President Muhammadu Buhari to allow the old naira notes, N500 and N1000 be deposited in commercial banks. He added that the CBN should be wary of its conflicting directives to commercial banks because it is causing additional pain to traumatized millions of innocent Nigerians seeking to return the old notes. “We appeal to President Muhammadu Buhari and the CBN to give this process a human face. The agony and trauma inflicted by the entire management of the policy are unspeakable. Accordingly, We plead with the CBN to allow the old notes to be deposited at commercial banks to ease the current pains and ordeal of returning the old notes.” On Friday, CBN denied directing commercial banks to start collecting the old naira notes. Nigerians continue to lament the hardship brought by the implementation of Naira redesign policy.
