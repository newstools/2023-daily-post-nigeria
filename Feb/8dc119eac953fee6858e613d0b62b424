Governor Nasir El-Rufai has denied reports that he revoked the Certificate of Occupancy of a bank in the state. Reports had on Monday emerged that El-Rufai had revoked the bank’s license for failing to comply with his directive to accept the old N500 and N1,000 notes from customers in the state. But reacting, the Governor said the report was a lie. He tweeted, “Cursed, congenital liars like you use social media anonymity every day to incite and acquire likes. “May your evil intentions translate back into your life experiences now and forever. “Why not show the pictures of the bank buildings and the bulldozers?”
