Chelsea have reportedly blamed a technology glitch for winger Hakim Ziyech’s failed January transfer move to Paris Saint-Germain on deadline day. Ziyech agreed on personal terms with PSG over a loan move for the remainder of the season, but the deal broke down in dramatic fashion on Tuesday night. Both Chelsea and PSG were expected to finalise an agreement, but the documentation to complete Ziyech’s transfer was not submitted in time. Ziyech was in Paris on deadline day preparing to be unveiled as a PSG player, but reluctantly returned to London and will finish the current season at Chelsea. Reports in France had claimed the Blues sent the incorrect documentation three times. However, according to The Telegraph, Chelsea are now claiming that a “technology glitch” was responsible for the failed move. Ziyech was left ‘upset’ after the late drama, with the 29-year-old having been keen to leave Stamford Bridge in January.
