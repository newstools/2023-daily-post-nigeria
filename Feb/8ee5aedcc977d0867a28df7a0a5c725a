Late arrival of election materials and the failure of the BVAS in some polling units, caused delays in the commencement of the elections at Kauran Namoda Local Government Area in Zamfara North senatorial zone. The affected polling units include Red block 035, Kaura town, where electoral officers came at around 12:30pm and Kyambarawa 016, where the BVAS machines did not work as they were not in good order. Voters were stranded for hours waiting for the arrival of materials. DAILY POST reports that the late arrivals of these election materials to the affected polling units constituted a significant problem to the exercise Some stranded voters at the affected centres blamed INEC for what they described as poor electoral arrangements. The INEC officials were seen doing their best to ensure that the affected BVAS were put into use. The problem was eventually rectified and voting commenced thereafter.
