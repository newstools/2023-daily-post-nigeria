The Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation (NTDC) has changed its name to the Nigerian Tourism Development Authority (NTDA). The federal agency expressed readiness to take the sector to the next level via partnerships, collaborations, regulations and revenue generation. The change of name followed the assent of the Nigerian Tourism Development Authority Act, 2022 by President Muhammadu Buhari. The Director-General, Folorunsho Coker said the new law will also boost collaboration between the federal government and states. “We must understand that if the laws are not right, investments will not come in”, Coker told NAN. “South Africa and Kenya amended their laws during COVID-19 pandemic and they thrived, but we did not.” The official disclosed he would soon meet with all Commissioners of Tourism in Abuja for discussions. Noting that legal frameworks helped the telecommunication and banking sectors to achieve positive results, he said “It is time for tourism to flourish”. Coker assured that with NTDA in effect, tourism will witness new initiatives that will sanitise the sector and generate huge revenue. The Nigerian Tourism Development Authority Act 2022 repeals the NTDC Act Cap N137 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004. The aim of the new law is to develop and promote Nigeria as a travel and tourism destination.
