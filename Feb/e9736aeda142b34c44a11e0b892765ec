Real Madrid are reportedly eyeing a shock move for Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp to replace current head coach Carlo Ancelotti when he finally leaves the Santiago Bernabeu in the near future. Ancelotti’s contract at Real Madrid will expire at the end of next season. There has been plenty of speculation that he may depart Real Madrid before then. In recent weeks, Ancelotti has been heavily linked with taking the vacant Brazil national team job, which Tite vacated following Brazil’s elimination at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. But the Italian has since said he was not interested in leaving Real Madrid to coach the Brazil national team. However, according to Todofichajes, Real Madrid president Florentino Perez could look to appoint Klopp should the German leave Liverpool by the end of the season. Liverpool, who are Real Madrid’s Champions League last 16 opponents, have had a disappointing season so far. The Reds currently sit in 10th position in the Premier League table. Despite having been at Liverpool for seven seasons, this may well be Klopp’s last, and that could open the door to a move to the La Liga champions. Klopp has had success at both Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool during his career and would no doubt be an excellent option for Los Blancos should Ancelotti decide to leave the Spanish giants.
