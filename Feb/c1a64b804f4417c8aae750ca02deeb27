Several Kaduna residents who queued in different bank ATMs since early morning on Wednesday, but could not withdraw a dime by 5 pm told DAILY POST they would not vote for any political candidate in this year’s election if the scarcity of fuel and the new currency continues. A man who identified himself as Mallam Abubakar said: “I came to this ATM at 6 am this morning, thinking as soon as they resume by 8 am, at most 10 am, I will get my money. We were here [since] with the promise that the bank would load cash by 3 pm, [but] nothing till now.” According to him, he saw no valid reason to make him vote for any political candidate. Another respondent, Moses James, said: “We were praying that bandits attack should stop. As security operatives try to calm all forms of attack, it’s now fuel scarcity and new currency. What reason do we have for going out to vote?” Mrs Agnes Paul, a businesswoman, expressed sadness over the whole issue. “I have little savings in the bank, but could not withdraw now. They meant I should continue to suffer like this, and during the election, I will suffer myself [again by] going out to vote?” she said. Grace Ojonigo, who expressed disappointment over the hardship, said the ruling government has set a bad precedent.
