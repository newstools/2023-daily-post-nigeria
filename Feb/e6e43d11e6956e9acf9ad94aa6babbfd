Isaac, brother of a former Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, said he regretted supporting Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the 2019 presidential election. In a Facebook post, Fayose said Atiku and the cabals around the seat of power are making Nigerians suffer. “With the way Atiku Abubakar and his goons in PDP in connivance with the wannabe cabals are trying to wrestle power from the present government in a foul way, making the people suffer for what is not, I make bold to say that I regretted backing him in 2019, never knew he’s this d*vilish,” Fayose wrote.
