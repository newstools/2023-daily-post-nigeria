Former Manchester City star, Didi Hamann, has suggested that Manchester City striker Erling Haaland is the club’s biggest problem under manager Pep Guardiola. According to Hamann, Haaland will not improve Man City’s team in the long term because he doesn’t fit in Guardiola’s style of play at Etihad. Haaland has been in a slump recently after a stunning start to the 2022/23 season. The Norway international has scored 25 goals so far this season but has not managed to link up well with his Man City teammates on the pitch. Speaking to talkSPORT, Hamann said: “I don’t care how many goals he [Haaland] scores or how many hat tricks he scores, you need to see how many goals the team scores. I think they have scored less goals at the same stage of last season and have got less points. I don’t think that Haaland is a player that fits into the team because he is everything the team is not.” He added: “He is good when you play quickly – at Dortmund, he scored his goals after they turned over the ball, played three or four passes and the ball was in the back of the net. With City, they pass the ball 30/40 times before breaking the team down and that’s not his game. I don’t think long-term he will improve City’s team and that is their biggest problem.”
