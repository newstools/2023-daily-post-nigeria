Ahead of Saturday’s presidential election in Kaduna State, the Inspector General of Police has deployed three Commissioners of Police (CP) and four Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCPs) for election duty. A statement issued by the Kaduna State Police Command spokesperson, DSP Mohammed Jalige, noted that the officers are headed by CP Sunday Babaji, the newly posted Commissioner of Police. Babaji, according to the statement, assured the people of the state and all political actors of absolute neutrality and a level-playing field in the Saturday general election, adding that the deployment is meant to provide watertight security before, during and after the elections. According to him, police will deal decisively with any recalcitrant element. The two other newly posted commissioners of police are Shehu S. Gwarzo ( Northern Kaduna senatorial zone of Zaria) and Paul Omata (Southern Kaduna senatorial zone of Kafanchan). The Deputy Commissioners of Police are Patrick Daoor (Southern Kaduna senatorial zone), Magaji Samaila (in charge of Zaria, Sabon Gari, Kudan and Makarfi LGAs) and Abdulazeez Sani (who will take charge of Kubau, Ikara, Soba and Lere LGAs). Assistant Commissioners of Police (ACP) deployed include Princewill Ijeoma, Mohammed Shamsuddeen and Garba Sule Yaro, among others. Babaji called on all citizens to give their maximum cooperation in ensuring the safety of all and to take advantage of the command’s designated emergency contacts when in distress. The deployment, according to him, became necessary to ensure no stone is left unturned in providing a conducive atmosphere for the people of the state to exercise their franchise and to prevent political thuggery before, during and after the elections.
