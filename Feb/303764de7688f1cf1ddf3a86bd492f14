The Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, NSCIA, has cautioned political leaders and actors against making provocative and unguarded statements which could drag the country into unnecessary conflict and anarchy. NSCIA, under the leadership of its President-General and Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammadu Sa’ad Abubakar, urged stakeholders to exercise calm over the outcome of Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections. The Deputy Secretary-General, Prof. Salisu Shehu, and Director of Administration, Arc. Zubairu Haruna Usman-Ugwu made the caution on Tuesday in a statement in Abuja. It stated that comments from politicians could put the country in a flare if caution is not taken.
