Bashir Ahmad, the Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Digital Communication, has dared Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State to take his old naira notes to the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, if hey are legitimate. On Friday, Ahmad was replying to Ganduje, who faulted the naira redesign policy and described it as a move to scuttle democracy and sabotage the forthcoming general elections. Ganduje also accused Buhari of introducing the policy on the eve of the elections, saying he should have done it in the past seven years or after the election. However, in response to Ganduje and others, Ahmad said they should stop the agitation and take their old naira notes to the CBN. “Baba Dan Audu, President Baba Buhari has ordered you to take your money to CBN. You will receive an alert if the Economic and Financial Crime Commission, EFCC and Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit, NFIU certify that they are legitimate.”
