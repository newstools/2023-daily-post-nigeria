The Governor of Anambra State, Prof Chukwuma Soludo has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to consider the hardship faced by common Nigerians as a result of currency redesign and ameliorate their plight. The governor said the current hardship is much and called on him to obey the ruling of the Supreme Court, which declared that the old and new notes should serve as legal tender for now. Soludo, who spoke during the burial mass of the First Republic Minister of Aviation, Chief Mbazulike Amechi, remarked: “I express gratitude to the President and Commander in Chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, who is represented by the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chief Chris Ngige. “I call on the President to consider the agony faced by the Nigerian people as a result of the new naira redesign policy. “Since the Supreme Court has declared that the old and new naira notes should remain legal tender until judgment is rendered, the President should obey the ruling of the apex court, which placed him in the position of President of Nigeria.”
