Former Manchester United striker, Michael Owen, has predicted that Arsenal will win the Premier League title ahead of Manchester City this season. Owen noted that Arsenal have a slight advantage over Man City as they head into their Premier League game-in-hand tie against Everton on Wednesday night at Emirates Stadium. Arsenal are currently two points ahead of second position Manchester City in the Premier League table. But if the Gunners defeated Everton at home, they would go five points clear ahead of Pep Guardiola’s side on the log. Speaking to Premier League Productions, Owen said: “It is a toss of a coin, isn’t it?! You have a team that has not done it for 13 years or something. “They have a slight points advantage, then you have the tried and tested, just sat there waiting for that mistake. “And they still have to go to the Etihad as well. I prefer to sit there with points in the bank. “I would probably side with the Gunners to win it [Premier League title] this year.”
