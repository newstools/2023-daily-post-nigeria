The youth wing of apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide has declared that it is yet to endorse a presidential candidate. With two weeks to the Presidential election, almost all the regional organisations have endorsed their choice Presidential candidate. However, the National President of OYC, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike told journalists in a statement on Saturday that it was yet to endorse any candidate. Okwu said the Igbo body was still consulting before taking a stand ahead of the February 25 presidential polls as many Igbo sons are on the ballot. He noted that, “we are delighted that as Nigerians go to the polls this February 25, we have capable Igbo sons vying for the presidency. “Among them is Mr. Peter Obi of the Labour Party, who is the presidential candidate. We also have Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, who is the Vice Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Justice Peter Umeadi of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, among others.” “These are all our capable, tested and trusted Igbo leaders who have distinguished themselves in various leadership roles. “It is based on this that we are still consulting to finally make our stand known on our choice candidate for the presidential election. This decision will be taken in the next couple of days,” he further stated.
