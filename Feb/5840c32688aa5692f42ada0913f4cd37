Former Manchester United centre-back, Rio Ferdinand, has suggested that Chelsea players have themselves to blame for allowing West Ham the chance to come back into the game during both teams’ Premier League tie on Saturday afternoon. Chelsea played a 1-1 draw with West Ham in Saturday’s Premier League tie at the London Stadium. Graham Potter’s side started Saturday’s contest really well and took a deserved lead when Enzo Fernandez dinked a perfect cross into the box for forward Joao Felix to tap home calmly. But a hopeful cross into the box evaded all of Chelsea’s defenders and was tapped in by West Ham star Emerson Palmieri at the far post as the match ended 1-1. “I think Potter will be sitting in there [the dressing room] seething. I think he will be going through a few players there,” Ferdinand told BT Sport at half-time. “They really dominated the early stages. You should be putting teams to bed the way they were so dominant, but they allowed West Ham the chance to come back into the game.”
