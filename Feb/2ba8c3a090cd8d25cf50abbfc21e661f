A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Dele Alake, has declared that the video wherein presidential candidate Bola Tinubu mentioned “bala blu…bulaba” was doctored. Alake, Director of Strategy and Communication in the APC Presidential Campaign Council, stated that his principal was a victim of calumny. “We can create wonders…here is a successful again. A town hall, different from Bala blu, blu blu, bulaba”, Tinubu said in November at a parley with private sector players. Critics argue that instances of the former Lagos governor’s incoherence were signs that he may not be fit for the presidency, but his supporters disagree. In an interview with Nigeria Info FM, Alake told Nigerians that the speech, recorded live by multiple different media outlets, was manipulated. “It’s not true, it was doctored. We showed the real original video clip on TVC and then it was broken into snippets and thrown on social media,” he said. The ex-Commissioner for Information in Lagos insists Tinubu remains the candidate to beat in the presidential election on February 25. Last August, Alake dismissed the popularity of Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate Peter Obi, describing his supporters as Nollywood ‘waka pass‘ (extras in movies). The campaign director maintained Tinubu’s achievements far surpass Obi’s and declared the latter “will trail far behind” in the contest. “This is not to denigrate him, these are hard facts. They’ve been governors for eight years. There is no basis for comparison between Obi and Tinubu. “The difference is clear. It’s like night and day, like fluke and substance. Our candidate is the substance”, Alake boasted.
