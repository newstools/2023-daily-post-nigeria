One of Nollywood’s finest actors, Federick Leonard has called Nigerians spineless talkers due to the ongoing hardship in the country. The Anambra-born Thespian made this known on his Instagram page. This is coming at a time when Nigerians are going through a fuel crisis, alongside shortage of the naira notes. Singer, Adekunle Gold had earlier lamented that Nigerians wasted 8 years of their lives under the President Muhammadu Buhari administration. According to Leonard, Nigerians are being treated poorly by their leaders because they (leaders) know that the citizens are “spineless talkers.” The actor, who recently got married to his fiancee, Peggy Ovire, said Nigerians will have to fight for the betterment of the country as freedom from oppressors does not come cheap. “We are indeed a country of Spineless talkers. #These leaders know, and that’s why they do us the way they do us. “As long as we remain spineless, Nigeria will never get better because freedom from bad and oppressive leadership is not free. #WeAreNotReadyYet,” he said.
