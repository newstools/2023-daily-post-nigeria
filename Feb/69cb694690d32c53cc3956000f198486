Former Chelsea head coach, Glen Hoddle, has backed manager Graham Potter’s decision to drop attacking midfielder Mason Mount from the starting XI. Hoddle said he was not surprised by Potter’s decision, adding that Mount needs some rest. Recall that Potter dropped the England international from his team’s starting XI that drew 1-1 with West Ham United in the Premier League over the weekend. “I am not surprised. In the length of time I have been in football. I have been waiting for that to happen,” Hoddle said (via Daily Star). “He is a very, very good young player, and he has looked sharp for many years. I think he needs a rest at some stage.” He added, “He was playing England games. Southgate trusted him and played him a lot. He needed a rest. If you look from his days, even at Derby, Frank [Lampard] played him all the time. He was always in the team. [Thomas] Tuchel was the same. He has had a hell of a lot of football. “He is only human, he is a young man, and I have been waiting for him to tail a little bit. The best thing for him is to take him out for a little bit, give him that breather, and then he’ll be chomping at the bit.”
