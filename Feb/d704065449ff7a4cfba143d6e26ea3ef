Suspected political thugs on Saturday attacked multiple polling units within the volatile Oshodi area of Lagos State. Voting in the presidential and National Assembly polls was going on at most of the locations when the assailants invaded. A video of the incident at Ogun Oloko Street near Oja Mafoluku in Oshodi and another at PU EC 30 B, among others, are circulating. The thugs, in their numbers, were armed with guns and machetes, residents cried out. They moved about in buses and motorcycles, destroyed polling units, burnt ballot papers and took away some boxes. There were similar cases in the Ikate Elegushi area. Journalist and podcaster, Joey Akan narrated his ordeal on Twitter. “Thugs have destroyed ballot boxes and threw away the ballot papers at Oba Elegushi. “I collected a couple of slaps for fighting back before I got pulled from the melee, into a house for my safety. “Now I have to be smuggled out of the voting area because I have been marked,” Akan tweeted.
