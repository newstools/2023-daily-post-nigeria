Chelsea defender, Thiago Silva, has lamented Jorginho’s decision to leave the club for Arsenal. Jorginho completed a £ 12 million move to the Premier League leaders on Transfer Deadline Day. Silva hailed the Italy midfielder as one of the “great leaders” in the Stamford Bridge dressing room and admitted he has joined “a direct rival”. He said: “We have lost one of our great leaders in the dressing room, Jorginho, a guy who spoke a lot, this gap will remain, but we have to move on. We didn’t expect him to leave, it happened. Now it’s time to make up for his absence in the best possible way. “(Jorginho) left for a direct rival and competitor. It’s things that happen in football. He would like to stay in England, his family is close. These are things that we have no control over, but we also have to understand the player’s side.”
