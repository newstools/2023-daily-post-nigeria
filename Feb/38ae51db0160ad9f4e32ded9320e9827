Three travellers lost their lives, while two others sustained injuries on Wednesday, along Kaduna-Abuja road. A resident of Kakau village, along Kaduna-Abuja express road, Mallam Nasir Idris said the accident was caused by overspeeding. According to him, the accident was caused by a tire burst as the bus ran into a pothole. “I was on my farm along the Kaduna-Abuja road when suddenly, I heard loud noise. As I rushed there with several other villagers, dust first covered everywhere. When the dust settled, three dead bodies were lying down,” he said. However, the sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps, Kaduna could not answer his calls as of the time of filing this report.
