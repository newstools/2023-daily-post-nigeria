A House of Representatives candidate of Young Progressives Party, YPP, for Awka North and South Federal Constituency, Mr Kingsley Uyammadu has said that only skills can redirect the minds of youth away from crime. Uyammadu who was at the Anambra secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, during the February congress of the union said education can bring enlightenment, but cannot stop people from engaging in crime, especially with the lack of jobs in Nigeria. “I have travelled far and wide, and my experience has shown that it is not education that made China, India and other developed countries what they are today. “What made those countries is the acquisition of skills. They gave their young people skills, and the people used it to put food on their table. “I’m privileged to have received education, but that is not what made me who I’ am today. I have skills, and I have worked on my skills “People graduate from the University every day, but where are the jobs for them? Education is not for everyone, but everyone is born with an innate skill that if well harnessed can take them through in life, “he said. Mrs Helen Mbakwe of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) who is contesting in the forthcoming election to represent Anambra Central zone in the Senate, also spoke at the occasion and argued that with hold legislation, the country can be redirected to the right path. “The problem we have in Nigeria is that the wrong people are the ones making laws for us. I’m a lawyer, and I read up to master’s degree in International Law. “With good laws, we will be able to boost the development of the country and also redirect their minds away from crime,” she said. Mbakwe added: “I want to offer my people resolute representation. You can not keep passing the jobs you should do to others. People who are abreast with law should be allowed to make laws. That is how we can help to develop Nigeria.”
