The All Progressives Congress, APC and its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu have filed a suit on the announcement of Saturday election results. The action followed the demand by the Labour Party, LP, and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, that Prof Mahmood Yakubu stay action. The Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, is presiding over the declaration of results from states. The suit by APC and Tinubu marked FHC/KN/CS/43/2023 was filed before the Federal High Court in Kano. The Action Alliance and INEC were joined as defendants; APC vice presidential candidate, Kashim Shettima was listed as a plaintiff. Daily Trust reports that plaintiffs, in a motion on notice filed alongside the originating summons, asked the court to make the order restraining the defendants. “Damages will not adequately compensate for the injury that may be occasioned on the Plaintiffs if by the Defendants stop the collation of the result,” the suit reads. Tinubu is topping the result table ahead of Atiku Abubakar, PDP, Peter Obi, LP, and Rabiu Kwankwaso, NNPP.
