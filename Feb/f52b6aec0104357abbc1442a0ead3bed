Famous Nollywood actress, Tonto Dike has reacted to the audio leaked by her ex husband, Olakunle Churchill, in which she could be heard saying she would have poisoned him if they were still together. In the audio recording released on social media by Churchill, Tonto said: ‘’See, If I was still with Churchill till now, he would have died. I would give him rat poison. Simple as that, and I will never have any bad feelings or guilt. I will walk away with ‘Oh, I am a widow’’ because it’s better I became a widow.” Acknowledging the voice recording in a post on her Instagram page and story, Tonto alleged that Olakunle was physically abusing her, insisting that if they were still together and he put his hands on her, it would have been his end. Also, she noted that Churchill is a fraudster who is on the US and the UK wanted list. The actress and Churchill have been on social media dragging each other over their son, King Andre.
