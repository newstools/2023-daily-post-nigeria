Famous Nigerian singer-turned-politician, Olubankole Wellington, also known as Banky W, has recalled how he once prayed never to marry someone in the entertainment industry. Revealing this on Wednesday while celebrating his wife, Adesua Etomi on her birthday in a post shared on his Instagram page, Banky W noted that “God’s plans are much better than anything we could have dreamt up for ourselves. “When I was ready for a wife, I specifically told God I didn’t want someone in the Entertainment business because my life was unstable enough. I wanted a 9 to 5 career lady in Banking, Telecomms, Aviation, and Oil & Gas. I didn’t want someone with a career as crazy as mine. “And when Susu prayed for her husband, she specifically told God she didn’t want a Musician, a Politician and Pastor. Lol. But here we are, almost six years into our marriage, and it’s crystal clear that God’s plans were much better than anything we could have dreamt for ourselves. “And so, @adesuaetomi, I want to celebrate you. It’s the ‘you’ for me. Thank you for loving me and birthing Z. Without you, I don’t know where or who I would be. The one thing I have learnt is that absolutely nobody is perfect. But you are just perfect for me. I love you now more than ever. I’ll love you forever.”
