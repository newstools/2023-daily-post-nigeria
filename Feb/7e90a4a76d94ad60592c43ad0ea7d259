After nearly seven years of legal battle, Justice Nnamdi Dimgba of a Federal High Court in Abuja on Tuesday freed an oil magnate and chairman of Atlantic Energy Drilling Concepts Nigeria Ltd, Mr Jide Jones Omokore of alleged fraud and money laundering allegations. Justice Dimgba freed Omokore and two of his firms, Atlantic Energy Brass Development Ltd and Atlantic Energy Drilling Concepts Ltd, on the grounds that the prosecution, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission EFCC, failed to prove the ingredients of the charge and consequently discharged them from all the charges. Meanwhile, the 4th and 5th defendants, Victor Briggs and Abiye Membere were found guilty of collecting gifts from Omokore, contrary to the laws guiding the conduct of public servants. Although the court had discharged them in counts 10 and 11 relating to them on the grounds that the money used to purchase the cars gifted to them were not from proceeds of fraud and money laundering, the court, however, held that they violated Section 98 of the Criminal Code which forbids public servants from receiving gifts from companies or individuals dealing with their office. Having found Briggs and Membere guilty of what he described as a lesser offence, Justice Dimgba, subsequently adjourned to Wednesday for allocutus and subsequent sentencing.
