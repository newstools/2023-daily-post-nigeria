The Senior Pastor of Dunamis International Gospel Center, Pastor Paul Enenche has declared that the alleged plots by some political bigwigs to rig the Saturday presidential election will not work. An audio record purported to be voices of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar and his running mate, Ifeanyi Okowa allegedly planning to rig the election had gone viral on social media. Atiku had since dissociated himself and the leadership of the party from the viral audio, saying it was aimed at tarnishing his image ahead of the election. Despite the clarification, Pastor Enenche in a video posted on his verified Facebook page, warned against any attempt to rig the election. He called on Nigerians particularly the officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC to resist the temptations. He said, “Refuse to be bought by money to influence results or manipulate machinery to produce false results. “A voice recording is in circulation, detailing the plot of a party leadership to influence INEC officials to using money so that they can rig the election or manipulate results in their favour. “Reject that temptation because the whole nation is aware already. Thay plot won’t work”.
