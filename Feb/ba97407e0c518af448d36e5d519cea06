Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State on Sunday expressed worry over the incessant attacks and killings in the state by political thugs. He warned those involved to abstain from such unlawful and heinous acts. Umahi issued the warning during a state-wide Fasting and Prayer Service held by the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and widows in Abakaliki. The programme was to pray towards the conduct of peaceful elections. Umahi decried the growing spate of political violence in various communities in the state, saying he would consider banning commercial motorcycle [Okada] operations in the state. The governor noted that there was a need for security agencies to be furnishing the state government with information in its effort to check instances of security breaches for action. He said all hands must be on deck by council chairmen, traditional rulers and the residents to move the state forward by ensuring lasting peace and stability in Ebonyi. Umahi said, “I have learnt that most of the killings are being carried out by motorcycle operators. “Well, for this, I may consider the banning of motorcycles anywhere in the state until after the election.” On the cash crunch, the governor urged security agencies to ensure the safety of both customers and financial institutions.
