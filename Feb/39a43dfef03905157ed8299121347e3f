The Actors Guild of Nigeria (AGN), has hit out at Kaduna State governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, over his recent interview on TVC. El-Rufai had described Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), as a Nollywood actor. He also dismissed Obi’s popularity, saying the former Anambra State governor would only get votes in the South-East and some parts of South-South. Reacting, AGN, in a statement signed by Kate Henshaw, the Director of Communications, at the weekend, said El-Rufai’s words were very offensive, adding that the governor should stop comparing Nollywood actors with unintelligent people. The statement read in part, “The attention of the leadership of the Actors Guild of Nigeria has been drawn to a derogatory statement made by the diminutive governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, referring to one of the presidential aspirants as a ‘Nollywood actor’. “Using actors to make sarcastic examples of an unintelligent person is arrogant and condescending of a public office holder. “The statement is very offensive and demeaning to the Actors Guild of Nigeria and Nollywood as a whole as it was purely intended to deride the acting profession.” It added, “The national president called on El Rufai to withdraw his nescience statement and tender an unreserved apology to Nollywood Actors immediately.” DAILY POST reports that the 2023 general election is just less than three weeks.
