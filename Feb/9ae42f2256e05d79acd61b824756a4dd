The senator representing Kogi Central senatorial district, Smart Adeyemi on Monday challenged governorship aspirants to a public debate on why they are contesting to succeed Governor Yahaya Bello. The lawmaker spoke with journalists in Abuja hours after picking the expression of interest and nomination forms to contest the governorship. He said nobody from the Kogi West senatorial district has governed Kogi State since its creation, hence, justice and equity demand that the district is allowed to produce the next governor of the state. Adeyemi then argued that he is the most qualified not because of having been a journalist and a three-time senator three times but because he has been exposed to developments across the countries of the world. Adeyemi who explained that he is not intimidated by the existing structure of the All Progressives Congress in the state challenged other contestants who have picked forms to an open debate. The Chief of Staff to the Governor of Kogi State, Abdulkarim Jamiu Asuku, from Kogi Central and, Chief James Faleke from Kogi West have at the beginning of sales of forms for the position by APC, obtained theirs last week. Adeyemi affirmed: “I am the most qualified in terms of exposure and wherewithal of turning things around for the better in Kogi State as far as good governance and genuine development are concerned.” He added: “I have a strong conviction that I have a smart solution to Kogi’s numerous challenges and I am the aspirant to beat as far as the goodwill and support from Kogi indigenes across the three senatorial districts are concerned.”
