Rangers head coach, Abdu Maikaba believes his team will reach top gear in the Nigeria Premier Football League soon. The Flying Antelopes recorded their second win of the season thumping Doma United 1-0 at the Awka City Stadium on Sunday. Chidera Ezeh scored the decisive goal from the penalty spot on 34 minutes. The Enugu club have now garnered seven points from their last three NPFL games. That run of positive results have eased pressure on Maikaba, who was attacked a few weeks ago following the team’s poor start to the campaign. “It was a good game that would have seen more goals from my boys but for some good goalkeeping from the opponents. I congratulate my team for this win as we try to overcome our difficult start,” Maikaba said after the game. “I am encouraged by this performance and believe that very soon, we shall start picking points on the road,” he said. The seven-time NPFL champions will face Bayelsa United in their next game at the Samson Siasia Stadium, Yenagoa on Wednesday.
