One of the spokespersons for the Bola Tinubu, Kashim Shettima Presidential Campaign Council, Bayo Onanuga, has described the Attorney general of Nigeria, Abubakar Malami, as a public enemy. His statement was contained in a post via his Twitter handle on Wednesday. Onanuga said Malami followed the footsteps of the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele. ”Abubakar Malami is also a public enemy like Emefiele,” he tweeted. He was reacting to the preliminary objection filed by the justice minister through his lawyers Mahmud Magaji and Tijanni Gazali, asking the Supreme Court of Nigeria to dismiss the suit filed by three northern governors to stop the implementation of the CBN’s naira redesign policy. The AGF had argued that the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the suit. He also contended that the “plaintiffs have equally not shown the reasonable cause of action against the defendant.” Recall that Governors Yahaya Bello of Kogi, Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna and Bello Matawalle of Zamfara had dragged the CBN and the federal government before the Supreme Court requesting that the implementation of the naira redesign policy be stalled.
