Coalition for Change and Integrity, CCI, has called for the arrest and detention of the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa. The coalition noted that the need to arrest and imprison Bawa without wasting more time is necessary because he (Bawa) has disobeyed court orders. The group made these disclosures via a statement available to DAILY POST on Friday. DAILY POST recalls that a Kogi State High Court presided over by Justice R.O. Ayoola had, a few days ago, directed the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, to effect Bawa’s arrest. Ayoola said that Bawa should be picked up and remanded in Kuje prison for disobeying a court order. The group noted that this is necessary because the EFCC chairman has allegedly trampled on the rights of many citizens and disrespected the courts. The group, in the statement signed by its publicity secretary, Comrade Tajudeen Adeyemi, said Bawa is expected to serve his 14 days sentence in Kuje as ordered by the court. It insisted that no lawful order of court should be disobeyed by constituted authority like the Police. It added that Baba’s failure to carry out the order of the court to arrest Bawa would amount to contempt of court. “Another chance has been presented to IGP Usman Alkali Baba to prove that he is a thoroughbred officer of the law, one that does not have the tradition of disobeying court orders. “Failure to carry out the order of the court to arrest and take Mr. Bawa to Kuje custodial centre will in itself amount to contempt of court, which would haunt IGP Baba in his career and after he exits service. “We call on the Inspector General of Police to immediately take the EFCC Chairman to prison as no lawful order of court should be disobeyed by constituted authority like the Police,” the statement read.
