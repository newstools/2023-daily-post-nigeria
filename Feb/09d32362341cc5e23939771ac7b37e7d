Former Aston Villa striker, Gabriel Agbonlahor, has slammed Manchester United forward Antony, branding him as a bluffer. Agbonlahor said Antony could not take on players, adding that the Brazilian international put in one and a half crosses per game. Speaking on talkSPORT, Agbonlahor hit out at Antony for his display for Erik ten Hag’s side so far this season. He said, “Manchester United, for me, have looked better since Erik ten Hag has come in. They have done better in the last few months. “But when I look at Antony… there have been a lot of big transfers in the Premier League, but £86 million for him? I think he is a bluffer.” He added, “When he gets the ball, he doesn’t take players on, and he has not got the speed to take players on. He doesn’t do what Rashford does. He’s put in one and a half crosses per game.”
