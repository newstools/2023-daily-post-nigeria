The Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) has vowed to oppose any attempt to foil peaceful transition of power after the 2023 election. The body chaired by Ijaw national leader, Chief Edwin Clark had on Thursday reaffirmed support for Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate Peter Obi. A former Information Minister, John Nwodo warned those who plan to disrupt the general polls fixed for February 25 and March 11. Nwodo stated that the forum and all well-meaning citizens will not allow those who “try to change the hands of the clock of Nigeria”. “We will not allow them to derail a peaceful transition to the next civilian government of this country. “We shall rise like one-man in defence of the ballot box and that Nigerians must go to vote”, the ex-Ohanaeze President-General asserted. Since late 2022, Southern leaders and groups have openly declared support for Obi, a former Anambra governor, insisting power must return to the region. Obi enjoys support for the youth demography but faces an herculean task as he seeks to pilot the retirement of the old guards in Nigeria’ politics.
