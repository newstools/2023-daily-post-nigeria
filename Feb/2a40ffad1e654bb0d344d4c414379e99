Tottenham Hotspur assistant manager, Cristian Stellini, has revealed what his boss Antonio Conte did for Spurs players after beating Manchester City 1-0 in Sunday’s Premier League tie. Stellini was in charge of Tottenham against Man City, with Conte recovering back in Italy after surgery to remove his gallbladder. Tottenham striker Harry Kane scored the only goal of the match to give the host all three points against Pep Guardiola’s side. Speaking at his post-match press conference, Stellini revealed that Conte gave Tottenham players a day off on Monday. Stellini said, “I am so glad, so happy to have the opportunity to train all the week these special players, this special team and want to say thanks to them and also all the staff that help around the players. Everyone pushed to another level. “We spoke to Antonio [Conte] in the dressing room. He was on the phone, he said he was very happy and he gave compliments to everyone, especially Harry [Kane]. He was very happy and he gave them all [Tottenham players] the day off tomorrow.”
