Former Real Madrid President, Ramon Calderon, has expressed his disappointment over the club’s legend Cristiano Ronaldo’s decision to join Al-Nassr. Calderon said Ronaldo should have remained in the top leagues in Europe for the next three years instead of joining Al-Nassr in the Middle East. Recall that Ronaldo ended his ties with Manchester United by mutual consent following his controversial interview with Piers Morgan last year. The Portugal captain eventually joined Al Nassr, signing a two-year contract with the Saudi Arabian club that will see him pocket a whopping €200 million yearly. “I would have liked him to play two or three more years in the top leagues,” Calderon told GB News. “I think he is still fit, in good shape. He has been a player that has taken care of himself very well for all of his career. But I suppose he thought that this is a good option, so I wish him the best as to all the players that have been playing with us.”
