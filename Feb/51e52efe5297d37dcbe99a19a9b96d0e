Former Manchester United defender, Gary Neville, has claimed “something isn’t right” at Manchester City, following their 1-0 defeat to Tottenham on Sunday. Neville also said Pep Guardiola’s team are “not as strong” as before. Harry Kane netted the only goal as Spurs beat City, denying them the chance to close the five-point gap between them and Arsenal. “You can never write Manchester City off. “It’s almost embarrassing that sometimes you are sat up here saying Guardiola has got it wrong, particularly when he proves himself so right so many times like he did a few weeks ago. “But something isn’t right at Man City. It just feels a little bit strange at the moment,” Neville said while on Sky Sports co-commentary duty.
