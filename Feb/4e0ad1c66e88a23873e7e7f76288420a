No fewer than eleven commissioners in Sokoto State have dumped the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, for the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC. The development followed an announcement by the stateâ€™s Deputy Governor, Manir Muhammad Dan Iya, resigning his membership in the main opposition party. DAILY POST had reported that Muhammad made the disclosure in a letter directed to the PDP Ward Chairman of the Kware Ward, Kware Local Government Area of the State. Reports of the defection hit the media a few hours before the presidential campaign rally of the ruling party. The APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, and his running mate, Kashim Shettima, are expected to land in the state for the campaign rally on Thursday. The defectors are expected to be officially received into APC by President Muhammadu Buhari during the rally.
