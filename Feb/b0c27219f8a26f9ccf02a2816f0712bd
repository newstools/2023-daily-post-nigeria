A spokesperson for the All Progressive Congress, APC, presidential Campaign Council, Femi Fani-Kayode has called for the removal and arrest of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN governor, Goodwin Emefiele. There are insinuations at the camp of the APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu that the move by the apex bank was targeted at frustrating the party during the forthcoming elections. The CBN governor had several times, debunked the allegations, stressing that the move has no political motives. But Fani-Kayode in a tweet on his official handle on Friday said Emefiele wants to scuttle the election by causing chaos via the currency crisis. The tweet reads, “Let me make this clear. Emefiele has NO intention of releasing new naira notes until March. He wants people to suffer, he wants chaos & he wants to scuttle the election. “He is a dangerous pawn in the hands of sinister anti-democratic forces. Remove, arrest & detain him NOW”!
