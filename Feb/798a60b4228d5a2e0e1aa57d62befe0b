The Police in Enugu State have restored the security details of the All Progressives Congress, APC, House of Representatives candidate for Igbo-Etiti/Uzo-Uwani constituency, Mr. Sam Ekwueme. He had cried out to the Inspector General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, claiming that his life was in utmost danger. Ekwueme’s claim, which was reported by DAILY POST on Thursday, was contained in a letter to the IGP through his lawyer, Ejike Ugwu. While alleging of a clandestine move to attack him, the Reps candidate said the Police Area Commander of Udenu, ACP Unaam Akaninyene sent a signal and withdrew all the officers attached to him on Feb. 14, 2023. He noted that the development came to him as a rude shock, adding that he applied for police protection in view of the security situation in Enugu State. DAILY POST reports that the security details have now been restored. This was confirmed in a telephone conversation by Barr. Ejikeme Ugwu of Ejike Ugwu & Associates. He told DAILY POST, Friday, that “the security details of Chief Sam Ekwueme has been restored. He expressed deep gratitude to the Inspector General of Police and Enugu State CP for restoring the public’s confidence in the institution of Police and urged them to purge the force of few bad eggs spoiling their image. “We have confidence that our client will win the February 25th election with a landslide and pray that all parties be given equal and free opportunity. “Let the choice of the people prevail.”
