A tanker has exploded along the Ogun State stretch of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, causing traffic diversion. DAILY POST reports that the crash occurred at about 07:30 am on Friday between Fidiwo bridge and Foursquare. Confirming the incident, the Federal Road Safety Corps, FRSC, said three persons were involved in the accident, but no injury or death was recorded. FRSC spokesperson in Ogun, Florence Okpe, said the crash involved an unregistered Daf tanker and one other vehicle. “The suspected cause of the crash was wrongful overtaking, leading to scratch of two vehicles resulting in sparks of fire. “The fire service men were contacted and traffic diverted immediately, with the crash scene cordoned off to avoid a secondary crash,” Okpe said. She quoted the Sector Commander of the FRSC in Ogun, Ahmed Umar, as advising motorists always to consider if it is right and safe whenever they want to overtake. Umar also advised motorists to drive cautiously and obey simple traffic rules.
