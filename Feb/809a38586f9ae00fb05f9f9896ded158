Ahead of the forthcoming presidential election, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has pledged to pursue 40% affirmative action for women in political appointments. Obi also said he would encourage the same for women in the corporate sector. The former Anambra State governor, who disclosed this in a post via his verified Twitter handle on Thursday, also said he would strive to ensure that Nigerian youths are adequately represented in governance. He wrote: “One of my major policy planks is inclusivity: accordingly striving for gender parity remains a priority. We are presently committed to 40% affirmative action for women in political appointments and will encourage same in the corporate space. “We will strive for the same percentage for Nigerian youths.”
