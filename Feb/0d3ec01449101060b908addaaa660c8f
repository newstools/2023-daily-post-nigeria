Popular broadcaster and socialite Ifedayo Olarinde, a.k.a Daddy Freeze, has disclosed that 65 out of the 83 women he counselled had cheated on their husbands. Buttressing actor Deyemi Okanlawon’s opinion that making love four times a week is small, Daddy Freeze, in a post shared on Friday on Instagram Daddy Freeze explained that sex is very vital in marriage or relationships and advised his followers not to be misled by motivational speakers. He said: “Intercourse is very very very important in a marriage or in a committed relationship. Don’t marry someone that can not satisfy you. Let me give you some scary statistics as a church leader. First, remember the Freenation Church only started in 2017, so all our members came from other churches, largely pentefraudsta. “In 2018, I counselled 83 married women. Sixty-five of them had cheated on their husbands, and 43 of them had cheated more than once. At the same time, 25 of them were in current relationships with other men. These were spirit-filled prayer warriors o. Some were even workers in my former Pente church. “If intercourse is not that important, please, why were they cheating?, from the moment you are engaged, my advice is, sample the goods, and taste the milk before you buy the cow. There is no scripture that says it is sinful for an engaged couple to have intercourse. “The word fornication was coined by authors of the King James Bible, and it never included sex between engaged or betrothed couples. Don’t be misled by motivational speakers.”
