The Supreme Court has nullified the nomination of Emmanuel Bwacha as the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Taraba. One of the APC aspirants, David Sabo Kente, filed a lawsuit against Bwacha’s candidature. A five-member panel led by Kudirat Kekere-Ekun delivered the judgement on Wednesday. Announcing their decision, Justice Adamu Jauro affirmed the verdict of the Federal High Court on September 20, 2022. The FHC in Jalingo, the state capital, held that the APC did not conduct a valid governorship primary. The apex court also set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Yola Division, which reinstated Bwacha on November 24. In his reaction, Kente said the “landmark judgment” has brought hope to the people of Taraba. The litigant expressed hope that others would take the Supreme Court ruling in good faith and make the APC stronger. Bwacha has been Taraba South Senator since 2011 when he was elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
