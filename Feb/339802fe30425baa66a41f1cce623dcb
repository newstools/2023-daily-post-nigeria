The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has denied issuing a sit-at-home order during the upcoming elections. IPOB said it has no interest in the elections conducted in Nigeria, hence, it never ordered a sit-at-home during the February polls. Emma Powerful, the spokesman of IPOB, said the group is only interested in the release of its leader, Nnamdi Kanu and the actualization of Biafra. Powerful said the Pan-Nigeria President of Igbo Extraction Coalition, PANPIEC, should stop linking IPOB to criminal gangs ordering sit-at-home in the South East. He noted that IPOB and the Eastern Security Network, ESN, do not have any faction or splinter groups. A statement by Powerful reads partly: “It’s on record and in public domain that IPOB has not called for any sit-at-home during the February elections. “We reiterate for the records that, IPOB have not, did not and will not issue any sit-at-home order in February during the elections period. “We also did not call for any boycott of the upcoming elections yet. Nobody should blame or link IPOB to the statements or actions of government [agents] operating in the Eastern Region.”
