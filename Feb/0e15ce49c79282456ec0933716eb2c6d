The Speaker of Adamawa State House of Assembly, Aminu Iya Abbas has won his bid for the Senate. Abbas who is of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, was on Monday declared the winner of the Adamawa Central senatorial election, ahead of his All Progressives Congress, APC, counterpart, Abdul-Aziz Nyako. Dr Ahmad Umar Alkali of Modibbo Adama University (MAU) Yola who was the Returning Officer, announced Abbas as the winner of the February 25th election after scoring 145,879 votes against Nyako’s 118,555 votes. Similarly, INEC declared Salihu Muhammad Abba of the PDP as the winner of the Yola North/Yola South/Girei Federal Constituency. Modibbo said Abba scored 71,223 votes to defeat his closest rival, Abubakar Baba Zango of APC who scored 54,335 votes. DAILY POST reports that Speaker Iya Abbas’ senatorial victory came as a surprise to many as he faced a popular candidate in the person of Abdul-Azziz Nyako, the senator for the district between 2015 and 2019 and son of former Governor Murtala Nyako. Also, Abbas had to deal with a legal battle over the Adamawa Central senatorial ticket which he won at the Appeal Court only last week.
