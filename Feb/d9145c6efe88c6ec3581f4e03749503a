Barcelona manager, Xavi Hernandez, has addressed the allegations of corruption the La Liga club is facing over an allegation of €1.4 million payment to the vice-president of the Spanish Referees Committee. The Nou Camp side have already issued a statement denying any wrongdoing after a new report revealed details of an investigation. Xavi, when asked by reporters about the situation, defended his club’s dealings. “I think it has happened in years I was not involved with the club, but I will always defend the institution. “We always analyse referees from an internal perspective. We check how they conduct the game, if they are very communicative or not; those are things we work on from a long time ago, but on an internal level,” Xavi said.
