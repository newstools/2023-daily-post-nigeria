Former federal lawmaker, Senator Shehu Sani has expressed concern over an alarm raised by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, alleging that some foreign hackers were attempting to gain access to its database. DAILY POST earlier reported that the INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, had on January 27, while speaking at the annual national conference of the National Association of Judiciary Correspondents, NAJUC, said some foreigners were attempting to hack the database. Yakubu, who was represented by the deputy director of ICT, Dr Lawrence Bayode, at the event, explained that the attacks are from different parts of the world, including France. Worried about the development, Shehu Sani, in a tweet on his official handle on Friday, called for caution, stating that the coming elections would be the first time the country would depend heavily on technology for polls. He expressed hope that the issue of hacking would be resolved before the February and March elections. He wrote, “This election is Nigeria’s first that will be heavily dependent on technology in voting and transmission of result. “We hope that the alarm raised by the electoral commission about “foreign hackers” has been squarely addressed”.
