Former Arsenal defender, Bacary Sagna, has urged manager Mikel Arteta to start Gabriel Martinelli when his team faces Manchester City in Wednesday’s Premier League tie at the Emirates Stadium. Sagna, a former Manchester City star, also wants Arteta to bench Leandro Trossard for Arsenal’s huge Premier League clash against title rivals Man City. “I would still start Gabriel Martinelli for Arsenal in the first team,” Sagna told Premier League Odds. “His skills, speed and finishing are a real treat to watch. “He will be a key solution to playing against Manchester City because their centre-backs are not the fastest. “Arsenal need to use his speed and keep Leandro Trossard on the bench.” The kick-off time for the match is 8.30 pm.
