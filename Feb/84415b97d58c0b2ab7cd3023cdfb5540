Manchester United head coach, Erik ten Hag has suggested that his team defeated Barcelona 2-1 in the Europa League playoff second-leg tie because his players played better in the second-half of the encounter. Ten Hag said that Barcelona did not create many chances or many problems against Man United during the Europa League clash at Old Trafford. The Dutchman watched as two goals from Fred and Antony gave Man United the victory over Barcelona. Ten Hag’s side qualified for the round of 16 stages on a 4-3 aggregate win, having played a 2-2 draw in the first leg at Camp Nou. Speaking at his post-match conference, Ten Hag said, “I think it was a cheap penalty, but Bruno [Fernandes] takes the risk, that is different to the approach in the Premier League and we have to get used to it. “We had chances, twice for Bruno, but Barcelona didn’t create that much or cause us that many problems. “The problem with us was a lack of belief. In the second half, it was much better. You bring yourselves forward, you bring the subs on with a lot of belief.” Man United will now face Newcastle United in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday.
