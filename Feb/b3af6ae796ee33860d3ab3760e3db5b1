A tanker loaded with Premium Motor Spirit, PMS, and heading towards Lagos, was on Wednesday burnt beyond recognition at Ore, on the Benin-Lagos Road. Speaking to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), the Ondo State Chief Fire Officer, Mr Busayo Araroba, said the fire occurred when the tanker fell because the driver was overspeeding. Araroba stated that the combined team of the Fire Service in Akure and Okitipupa were able to quench the flame and prevented the fire from escalating to the environment. He urged drivers of tankers to always regulate their speed, considering the content in their vehicles, and to always have functional fire extinguishers in their trucks. Araroba, who confirmed that there was no casualty, urged the public to be vigilant during this dry season and to promptly call the emergency phone number of the fire service whenever there was a fire outbreak. He added that firefighters in the state are ready to give swift support.
