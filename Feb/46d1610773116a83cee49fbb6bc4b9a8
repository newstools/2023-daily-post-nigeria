Famous Nigerian actor and model Alexx Ekubo has disclosed he is no longer interested in anything that leads to marriage. The actor, who seems to be dealing with the aftermath of his messy break up with his ex-fiance Fancy Acholonu stated this in a post on his Instagram page while responding to a lady who joked about her plans to marry him. It all started when Alex shared his photo on his Instagram story. Reacting to the post, an Instagram user said she’s looking for money to “marry him properly.” She wrote: “I’m planning our wedding babe. Let all this scarcity of money go first so that I can marry you properly @alexxekubo.” Reacting to this, Alex said: “I have removed my hands from anything that will lead to marriage.” Recall that the internet was set agog in August 2021 when Fancy Acholonu called off her three-month engagement to the actor. Confirming their breakup, Fancy Acholonu took to her Instagram page to plead for privacy. According to Fancy, she broke up with him because they both needed to find happiness and live in their truth.
