The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, has debunked claims that the Muhammadu Buhari-led government is working towards an interim government, saying there is no way the naira swap would keep the President in office beyond May 29. Shehu said those who peddle such rumour stand to gain nothing rather are creating panic and inciting the public against the federal government. This was contained in part of the statement he issued on Friday via his verified Twitter page. He acknowledged that the currency swap had created a lot of pressure on the law enforcement agencies, as well as the party and its elected officials and candidates. Shehu also said Buhari is concerned with profering solutions to the problem and has opened several channels for consultation with leaders and groups across the country. Part of the statement read: ”Let us clearly, specifically and emphatically state that there is absolutely no truth to the claim that President Muhammadu Buhari is working towards an interim government or even worse, the truncation of democracy- democracy that he has helped to keep alive not only here at home, in West Africa but throughout the continent. ”The President looks forward to handing over the reins of power to his elected successor. This will happen on May 29, 2023 as the constitution requires it.”
