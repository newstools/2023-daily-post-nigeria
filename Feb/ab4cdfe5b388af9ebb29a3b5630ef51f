A pregnant housewife in Adamawa State was abducted and raped by her uncle and a neighbour in Maiha Local Government Area. The suspects, Suleiman Adamu, 29 and Ahmadu Umaru, 26, both of whom are residents of Machimin community in Maiha LGA, were apprehended by operatives of the Adamawa State Police Command. Suleiman was identified as the victimâ€™s uncle, while Ahmadu, his friend, was her neighbour. Both men are married with children. Suleiman allegedly informed Ahmadu of his love for the victim and his desire to have sex with her. The suspects allegedly perfected the plan to invade her house by night after they were informed that her husband had travelled. Armed with cutlasses and wearing face masks, they stormed her house by 11 pm and whisked the target away to a valley where they raped and abandoned her. Trouble, however, began for the men when the woman, upon finding her way home, was able to identify one of her assailants as her neighbour, despite covering his face with a mask. She reported the assault to the police who, aided by local hunters, tracked down the suspects and arrested them. Both suspects subsequently confessed to the crime during interrogation at the police headquarters in Yola. Adamawa State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Suleiman Nguroje, on Wednesday confirmed that Commissioner of Police Afolabi Babatola had ordered the case transferred to Police CID for further investigation and prosecution.
