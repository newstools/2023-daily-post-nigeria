President Muhammadu Buhari has been asked to apologize to Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, if a state of emergency is not declared in Kaduna State. Reno Omokri, a socio-political activist, made the call over El-Rufai’s verbal attacks on Buhari and his government. El-Rufai accused Buhari of allowing evil individuals to use him to fight and defeat the All Progressives Congress, APC. He also claimed the same people were plotting a military takeover. El-Rufai said those people who are using the president as an instrument to defeat the APC are doing so because they failed in their bid to force their own candidate on the party during the June 2022 primaries. The governor was reacting to Buhari’s pronouncement on Naira redesign policy and the ongoing currency crisis Nigerians are experiencing. He stressed that the old naira notes would be valid in Kaduna State. However, Omokri said the governor had defied the directive of the CBN. In a tweet, Omokri wrote: “What Nasir @elrufai has done in defying the CBN’s directive approved by Buhari, by saying the old Naira notes would still be valid in Kaduna, is treason. If a state of emergency is not declared in Kaduna, then Buhari should apologise to Nnamdi Kanu and release him.”
