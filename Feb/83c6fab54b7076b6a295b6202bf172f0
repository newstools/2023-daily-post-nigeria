Manchester City goalkeeper, Ederson was not shown a red card after he gave away a penalty at Arsenal, despite the Brazilian having already been booked. The City stopper was cautioned in the 36th minute for time wasting. At that point, Kevin De Bruyne had given the champions a 1-0 lead. But when Ederson then collided with Eddie Nketiah and referee Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot, many fans at the Emirates expected to see a second yellow. But Taylor didn’t send the Brazilian off. Discussing the incident on Amazon Prime Video, former referee, Chris Foy noted that Ederson had been “careless and not reckless” in his actions. He added: “No we don’t [want this type of penalty given all the time], but it’s a good decision and it’s an accurate decision because even though he’s played the ball, Nketiah, he’s clearly tripped by him.”
