Former Tottenham boss, Tim Sherwood has told Antonio Conte never to feature new signing, Pedro Porro in his lineup again, describing the Spaniard as ‘absolutely disgusting.’ He feels the 23-year-old’s defending during Tottenham’s 4-1 defeat to Leicester City in the Premier League on Saturday was very bad and slammed the club’s Chairman, Daniel Levy for recruiting such a player for the north Londoners. Tottenham brought in the Spanish right-back from Sporting CP on transfer deadline day on an initial loan deal for £5 million with the obligation to buy this summer for £39 million. The 23-year-old was just playing his very first game for Tottenham on Saturday at the King Power Stadium. Rodrigo Bentancur put the visitors ahead after 14 minutes but Leicester responded with goals from Nampalys Mendy, James Maddison and Kelechi Iheanacho and Harvey Barnes with Porro enduring a torrid time. And Sherwood was left shocked by the full-back’s defensive efforts. “I don’t want to keep picking on the kid but he needs to be relieved of his duties,” Sherwood told Soccer Saturday. ‘I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt because it is his debut but Pedro Porro is so bad it is unbelievable. “His positioning is absolutely disgusting, Barnes and Maddison are destroying him down the left-hand side…”
