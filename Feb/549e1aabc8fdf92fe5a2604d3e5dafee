The Syrian American Medical Society, SAMS reported that at least 105 people died in Syrian opposition areas due to a strong earthquake on Monday morning. The Chairman of SAMS, Bassel Termanini, told dpa that the organisation covered about 50 per cent of the healthcare in the areas. Termanini said he got reports that 105 people have been killed at the moment and more than 600 seriously injured, mainly in the countryside of Aleppo and Idlib. He added that the numbers were expected to rise as rescue operations continued and patients recovered from the earthquake rubble. Ibrahim al-Haj, a spokesperson for the voluntary White Helmets rescue service in the countryside of Aleppo, told dpa, “We are in disaster territory; some of my family members are still under the rubble.” He said the injured mainly suffer from skull fractures, and broken legs and arms.
