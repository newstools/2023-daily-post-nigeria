Former Manchester United striker, Wayne Rooney, is interested in becoming the new Southampton manager, according to talkSPORT. The Saints are looking for a new boss after Nathan Jones was fired after only 14 matches in charge. Rooney, who is currently at DC United, would relish the chance to return to English football. However, he is facing competition from his former England teammates Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard. Lampard, meanwhile, was sacked by Everton last month, while Gerrardâ€™s spell at Aston Villa came to an end in October. Southampton are stuck at the bottom of the Premier League table with just 15 points from 22 games.
