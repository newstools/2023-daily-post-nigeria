Big Brother Titans reality TV housemate Khosi, couldn’t hold her tears after the show organiser, Ebuka Obi Uchendu, called out Yemi for visiting fellow housemate Blue Aiva every midnight. Ebuka had, during the eviction night on Sunday, questioned Yemi why he was always leaving Khosi’s bed for Blue Aiva’s almost every night around 2 am. “Yemi leaves Khosi’s bed almost every night around 2 am to be with Blue Aiva,” he said. A shocked Khosi couldn’t hold herself from crying as Yemi tried to explain things to her. After the live show, a video sighted on social media showed Yemi consoling Khosi, who wept bitterly over what she had just discovered. Yemi told Khosi that “What Ebuka said tonight is not true. I have never sneaked out at midnight to go see Blue Aiva, not to talk of kissing her. I want you to believe me. Big Brother should even play the tape so that you can confirm it yourself.” Speaking further, he promised Khosi that he’s putting an end to whatever he has with Blue tonight and assured her that even though he is a flirt, he really wants to be with her.
