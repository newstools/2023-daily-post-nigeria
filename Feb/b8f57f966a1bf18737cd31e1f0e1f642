Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom has officially endorsed the Labour Party presidential candidate for the February election, Peter Obi. Ortom, who spoke at a Town Hall meeting in Makurdi the State capital on Thursday, said the 2023 election should not be based on party, stating that all the political parties in the country had failed Nigerians. The governor who got a rousing ovation after declaring Obi as his candidate, said a new Nigeria that would give its citizens equity, fairness, and justice must emerge via the coming poll. He said, “we have come to a time where we must leave out sentiments and save Nigeria by looking at individuals who can lead with the fear of God and provide gainful employment for the youths. “We must, in this 2023, fashion a new Nigeria, Nigeria that will give the people equity, fairness, and justice. “The PDP has failed Nigerians, APC has failed Nigerians, political parties have failed Nigerians, even the Labour Party has failed Nigerians. We must therefore look at individuals, those people who can deliver. “So, this is not about party, I am not in the Labour Party but I am working for Peter Obi. Peter Obi will make sure that we sleep with our two eyes closed. These unnecessary killings that are going on in our country will stop. “I have chosen to support him. I appreciate you all for choosing Peter Obi. Of the three presidential candidates, Peter Obi has the character, competence to lead Nigeria.” Governor Ortom made the bold declaration shortly after the State High Court barred the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, from suspending and expelling him.
