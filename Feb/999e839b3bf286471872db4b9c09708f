Gunmen have attacked the premises of a media house in Port Harcourt, Atlantic TV Network & Wish 99.5 FM, Ozuoba, in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State. The assailants were said to have attacked the station at about 9pm on Tuesday (yesterday), destroying parts of its power supply connections and some transmission devices.

The Chairman of the media outfit, Hon Chinyere Igwe, said he immediately alerted the Police Public Relations Officer of the Police Command in Rivers state, adding that he also made a formal entry at the Ozuoba police division. Igwe appealed to the youths to resist being used as agents of destruction by greedy and self-centered politicians and pay masters, who perceive opponents of their selfish interests as enemies that must be destroyed.

He is also a supporter of the Presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar.
