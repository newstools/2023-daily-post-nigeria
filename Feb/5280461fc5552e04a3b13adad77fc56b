Popular Nigerian singer, Oladapo Daniel Oyebanjo, known as D’banj, has dissociated himself from inciting comments suggesting him taking sides in the fight between his colleagues Seun Kuti and Peter Okoye. This message comes on the heels of the back and forth between the famous Nigerian singer and internet personality Peter Okoye and Seun Kuti over support for presidential candidates in the forthcoming general elections. D’banj, in a statement signed by his lawyer, Pelumi Olajengbesi and made available to DAILY POST on Sunday, advised the public to disregard what he described as “mischief” of a publication maliciously pushed to drive traffic to gossip blogs and stoke non-existent conflict between him and his well-regarded colleagues in the industry. According to the statement: ”This is to notify the public that Mr Oladapo Daniel (D’Banj) never made any derogatory or disparaging statement against anybody, especially within the entertainment industry, nor has he directed the publication of any such material on his behalf.” While expressing shock over the false publication attributed to him, the singer added that: “They must all remain one big family in the industry. Though political ideologies may differ and could be expressed in heated ways, the irrefutable truth is that elections will come and go.”
