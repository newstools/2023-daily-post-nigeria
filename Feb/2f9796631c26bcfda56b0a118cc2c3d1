Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu on Thursday said Nigeria’s problem is not corruption but lack of cohesion and unity among the people. Ikpeazu made the assertion at the public presentation of a book in Abuja. He said Nigeria’s greatest problem is not security or the economy. ”It is a lack of cohesion. It is disunity. Our problem is mutual suspicion and lack of mutual respect.” he said He urged Nigerians to see the country as belonging to everyone under one God, adding that to build the country, Nigerians must come together irrespective of tribe and religion.
