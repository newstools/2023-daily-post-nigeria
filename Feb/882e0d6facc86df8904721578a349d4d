Again an early morning fire has destroyed a three-bedroom apartment and three shops in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital. The fire incident which occurred at about 03.24 hours at No6 beside Atoto Press, Oko-Erin area in Ilorin West Local Government Area of Kwara state, destroyed property worth N18.2m. The incident happened barely some hours after a petrol tanker exploded and burst into flames while discharging fuel on Sunday evening at the M.M Rodiat filling station along the Sobi Specialist Hospital, Alagbado area of Ilorin. The Sunday evening tanker explosion, destroyed property worth N56.8m, though no loss of life was recorded. The Monday fire which gutted a building of about three bedrooms and three shops was reportedly caused by a power surge, according to the spokesman of the state fire service, Hassan Adekunle in Ilorin on Monday. He disclosed that on getting to the scene, “we realized that the whole building had been engulfed by the blazing fire due to the late call by sympathizers.” Hassan said though the conflagration was huge, the firefighters were able to demonstrate a high level of professionalism and in no time the ravaging inferno was totally extinguished. He said the surrounding area was also damped to stop the further escalation of the fire. Director of Kwara State Fire Service, Prince Falade John Olumuyiwa, urged residents to always cultivate the habit of switching off their electrical appliances even before bedtime.
