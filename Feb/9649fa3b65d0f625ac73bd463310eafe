A former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode has disclosed what awaits the presidential candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar, Peter Obi of Labour Party, LP, and his running mate, Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed if Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress, APC, wins Saturday’s election. Fani-Kayode said Atiku would be sent back to Dubai, Datti would be sent to Mauritania, while Obi would be flushed down the toilet. In a series of tweets, Fani-Kayode expressed the belief that Tinubu would be declared president-elect next week. Fani-Kayode wrote: “After Asiwaju wins we will send Ibn Dubai back to Abu Dhabi, send Dati the Daft back to Mauritania and flush Peter the Pooh down the toilet. “Next week the Asiwaju of the world will be declared President-elect and the heavens will rejoice! Glory Hallelujah. “That Atiku, another Fulani, should succeed Buhari, who is also Fulani, is unacceptable, inequitable, unjust & dangerous because it confirms the misguided, erroneous & insulting notion that Nigeria has a master race who are born to rule.”
