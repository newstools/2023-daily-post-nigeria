Muslim and Christian Clerics have warned against electoral violence and voting based on tribal and religious grounds. Malam Aminu Baba Waziri, the Chief Imam of Takur central mosque on Friday evening called on the Muslim Ummah to come out en mass to exercise their constitutional rights and vote for competent leaders. He warned the Muslim faithful that would be asked about the decisions they made for Nigeria on the day of judgement. Also commenting on the election, Pastor Daniel Azanah, advised people to vote for the right candidate that will help in the development of the country. The clerics, however, warned the public to shun electoral violence and voting based on tribal and religious sentiments.
