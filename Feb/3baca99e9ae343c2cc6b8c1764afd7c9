French boss, Zinedine Zidane has given Real Madrid president Florentino Perez one condition to fulfil before he (Zidane) could return as the club’s manager. The Frenchman would be willing to make a return to Santiago Bernabeu only if Perez agrees to sign Rayan Cherki, according to Sport. The former Real Madrid player and manager is keen to work with the French sensation. Zidane is said to have told Perez he would return to the club as a replacement for Carlo Ancelotti if he is guaranteed the signing of Rayan Cherki. Cherki is widely seen as one of the most exciting young players in European football at the moment and Zidane is a huge fan of the versatile forward. Ancelotti’s future at the Spanish giants is not certain despite the veteran manager leading Los Blancos to La Liga and Champions League success last season. Real Madrid are second in the league, eight points behind their arch-rivals Barcelona.
