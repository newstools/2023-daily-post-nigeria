Former Germany international, Roman Weidenfeller has picked his greatest footballer of all time between Paris Saint-Germain’s Lionel Messi and Al-Nassr’s Cristiano Ronaldo. Messi and Ronaldo have dominated the football landscape for the last two decades. Both Ballon d’Or winners, who are now in the final phase of their careers, have broken almost every goalscoring record and have been very successful with both club and country. At the peak of their careers, Messi and Ronaldo spent nine seasons facing off while playing for rival La Liga clubs Barcelona and Real Madrid. With a combined 76 major trophies (Messi 42, Ronaldo 34), they are two of the most decorated players in the history of football. Both forwards are among the eight players to score over 700 goals apiece for club and country. In an interview with KhelNow, Weidenfeller named Messi and Ronaldo as the two best players he has had the opportunity to share the pitch with. He, however, picked the Argentina captain as the best player among the duo, having won the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Weidenfeller said, “Very obvious, Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo (best players I shared the pitch with). Maybe now Lionel Messi, as he has won everything you can win in football (after the World Cup 2022 win).”
