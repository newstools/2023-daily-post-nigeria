Former Newcastle United, goalkeeper Shaka Hislop, has urged Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta to drop Gabriel Martinelli for his side’s Premier League clash against title rivals Manchester City. Hislop believes Martinelli is struggling and not playing well for Arsenal lately. He spoke after Arsenal drew 1-1 with Brentford in Saturday’s Premier League tie, thanks to Leandro Trossard’s goal. According to him, Arteta should drop Martinelli for Trossard, who joined Arsenal in the January transfer window, when they face Manchester City. Arsenal will host Man City at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday night in a potentially big game in this season’s Premier League title race. “I don’t think Gabriel Martinelli has been great lately,” Hislop told ESPN. “When he has come on, Leandro Trossard has had an impact. “So if you are [Mikel] Arteta, I think the time is right to think: “Well, do I now play Trossard from the very start?” “Now, Martinelli is quick, and defences coming up against that kind of pace, you’ve to adjust just for that pure speed that Martinelli brings. But he has not had much of an impact. He has not been playing well and is struggling a bit. “I think, given the form of Trossard, given the fact that he is finally got on the scoresheet for Arsenal, that you’ve to play him from the very start.”
