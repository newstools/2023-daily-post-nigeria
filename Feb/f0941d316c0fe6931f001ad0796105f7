Retired General Olu Bajowa, a former Adjutant General of the Nigerian Army, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari not to yield to former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s call for the cancellation of the results of the February 25 presidential election. Bajowa, in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja, specifically described Obasanjo’s call for the cancellation of the election results as undemocratic, insisting that the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate (APC), Bola Tinubu, lost Lagos State to his Labour Party counterpart Peter Obi. Obasanjo had on Monday called for the cancellation of the result of Saturday’s general election. Bajowa said that although Obasanjo fought for the unity of Nigeria, his position on the 2023 presidential election results was unpatriotic. He said, “Such calls could truncate Nigeria’s democratic process at this very crucial stage. “I advise President Muhammadu Buhari not to be deterred by the anti-democratic voices making the rounds and not be swayed, deceived, or persuaded to allow anyone to destroy his worthy legacy of excellent service to our great nation. “A quick glance at the results announced so far by INEC paints a clear picture of the direction to which the voice of the people is tilted.” He continued, “For instance, the official release of results so far showed that President Buhari lost Katsina, Bola Tinubu lost Lagos, [Mallam Nasir] El-Rufai lost Kaduna, [Abdullahi] Ganduje lost Kano, [Simon] Lalong lost Plateau. “All these [four] states are strongholds of the ruling political party [APC], how else can a process be free, fair, and transparent.” Meanwhile, both the PDP, LP, NNPP had also called on INEC to cancel the election due to his refusal to upload results electronically on its website.
