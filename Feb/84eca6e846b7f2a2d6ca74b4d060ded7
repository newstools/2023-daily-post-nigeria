Manchester United legend Gary Neville has named Everton duo, Jordan Pickford and Seamus Coleman, as to blame for the Toffees’ 2-0 loss to Liverpool. It was the duo’s mistake that gifted the Reds their opening goal in the Merseyside derby at Anfield, with Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo scoring for the home side. The Reds were certainly helped by Everton goalkeeper Pickford who seemed to be completely caught in no man’s land. Neville noted on Sky Sports: “It’s not interesting, it’s just bad. I have no idea what he’s doing. “It’s almost as if he thinks the ball is not going to end up at Salah’s feet.” Speaking on Coleman’s role in the goal, he added, “He jumps, he doesn’t delay the counter, he quickens it up and we know how brilliant they are on the counter. They’ve been like that for years.”
