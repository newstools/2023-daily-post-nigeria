The suspected killers of a former staffer of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Kehinde Fatinoye and his wife, Bukola, have been arrested by the police in Ogun State. The Fatinoyes were reportedly murdered in the early hours of January 1, just immediately after they returned from a crossover church service. Mrs Fatinoye, who was until her death a Principal Confidential Secretary at the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, was killed and burnt alongside her husband by their assailants. DAILY POST reported that their only son, Oreoluwa, who was driven away by the suspects was later found dead inside the Ogun River along Obada-Adigbe road. Recall that the driver of the Fatinoyes, Lekan Adekanbi, was earlier arrested as the only suspect in the incident, but he escaped from police custody when he was taken to hospital after he pretended to have fainted. However, police sources said he had been rearrested alongside his accomplices in the matter. Confirming the arrest on Thursday, the police spokesman in Ogun, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said all the suspects involved in the killing of the Fatinoyes have been arrested, promising to give details later.
