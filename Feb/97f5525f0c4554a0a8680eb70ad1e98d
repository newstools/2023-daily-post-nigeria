Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to end the “endless drift into the abyss of chaos” created amid the naira crisis in the country. Akeredolu blasted the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN, Godwin Emefiele, for the “obviously mischievous implementation” of the naira redesign policy. He explained that the naira crisis affecting the generality of Nigerians has shown that policy has woefully failed. Akeredolu urged Buhari to do the needful in ending the currency chaos. He called on Buhari to allow the Supreme Court’s order on February 8 restraining CBN from implementing the February 10 deadline to stop the circulation of old naira notes. “There is incontrovertible evidence bordering on miscalculation, error of judgment and disinformation on the part of the policymakers. In this case, the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Mr Godwin Emefiele, on the failed implementation of the policy, the effect that compels the whole country to groan, immeasurably, at present”.
