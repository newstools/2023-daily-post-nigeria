Barely four days to the February 25 presidential election, the British High Commissioner in Nigeria, Catriona Laing, has disclosed post-violence as her greatest fear. Laing disclosed this on Tuesday in a Channels Television interview. She called on Nigerian politicians to caution their supporters against heating the polity. The high commissioner stated the next president should focus on the country’s economy by ending Fuel subsidies, tackling multiple exchange rates, and raising taxes. Laing added that the UK, including the international community, want Nigeria to succeed. “The most worrying is the post-election violence. To avoid this, we are urging the heads of the political parties to ensure that their supporters accept the election’s outcome. And if they feel they want to challenge the result, it should be done through the Court, the judiciary process”, she stated.
