A mob of angry youths in the Mbukpa neighbourhood of Calabar South LGA of Cross River State on Wednesday invaded the divisional police station on Mbukpa Road over alleged police brutality that led to the killing of a young man by officers from the station. Pius Akpan, who witnessed the incident near a petrol station on Mbukpa road at the weekend, told DAILY POST the victim was kicked and hit severally with gun butt by a team of policemen. “He was beaten black and blue and eventually they shot him to death,” said Akpan who claimed no one is aware of the offence committed by the yet-to-be-identified victim. A youth leader in the area, Effiom Effiom said the Mbukpa Police Station had called for reinforcement when it became obvious that trouble was brewing as the number of angry youths around the station increased. The reinforcements, arriving in the nick of time, repelled the angry youths and barricaded the station.
