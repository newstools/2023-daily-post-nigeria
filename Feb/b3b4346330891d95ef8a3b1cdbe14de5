The presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu visited Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State on Thursday. Tinubu was received by Makinde in his office in Ibadan, the state capital. Makinde, elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in 2019, and seeking another term in office, is one of the G-5 governors in PDP who have failed to declare open support for Atiku Abubakar, the party’s presidential candidate. Many of the residents were surprised when the APC presidential candidate stormed Ibadan to visit Makinde, a governor on the platform of PDP. Tinubu’s men who accompanied him to visit Makinde included the former governor of Osun State, Chief Bisi Akande, Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare and Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State. Former governors Ekiti and Osun respectively, Kayode Fayemi and Gboyega Oyetola were also in Tinubu’s entourage. Tinubu, while speaking said that he was in Oyo State to solicit the endorsement of Makinde ahead of the February 25 presidential election. Makinde, in his response, said he would choose unity of the country, equity and fairness over politics. He, therefore, urged Tinubu to carry on with his campaign. He added that the people of the state would vote for equity and fairness on February 25.
