Popular Nigerian actress, director and movie producer, Chioma Chukwuka Akpotha has cried out after being attacked at her polling unit in Lagos. The actress said she was mishandled. Chioma, who was on Instagram live to capture the moment amid fear, noted that political thugs disrupted her polling unit and scattered ballot boxes. “See them. These guys turned everything upside down. So all the Army and police personnel they said they deployed to help us guide our votes, where are they, what are they doing?” She queried. According to the video, some of the voters present at the polling unit, majorly men, were seen challenging the thugs, while others were running helter-skelter for safety.
