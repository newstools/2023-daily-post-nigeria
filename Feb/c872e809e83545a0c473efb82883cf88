The Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, has told all the political parties and their candidates that they must be ready to accept the outcome of the presidential and other elections even when such results do not favour them. CAN also insisted that the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, must put every necessary measure in place at this point to give Nigerians a credible, free and fair poll. CAN said this in a statement signed by its president, Archbishop Daniel C. Okoh, and made available to reporters in Abuja on Friday. CAN made it clear that election is not war and should be seen as a period of peaceful transition of power. On security, the Christian body called on the authorities to put the necessary machinery in place, especially in communities vulnerable to attacks and ensure that no citizen is disfranchised owing to the precarious security situation in parts of the country. “[We] call on all the political parties and candidates seeking elective positions during the forthcoming general elections to accept the results of the polls in good faith in the interest of Nigerians and the unity of the country,” CAN stated.
