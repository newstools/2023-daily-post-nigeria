A coalition of civil society groups rose from a meeting in Kano asking Nigerians to shame the “enemies of the nation” who are behind the anti-people currency swap policy by standing firmly behind the presidential candidature of Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress, APC. The convener of the group, Ibrahim Suleiman said: “We understood the pain and suffering of innocent Nigerians caused by the persistent fuel scarcity in the country, coupled with the abrupt naira redesign programme, but Nigerians should endeavour to shame these enemies of progress and stand solidly behind the presidential candidature of Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu.” Speaking on Wednesday, the group, alleged that the sinister motive was conceived and unleashed on innocent Nigerians by opposition parties with an ulterior motive to dent Tinubu’s candidature. They further alleged that fifth columnists in the presidency are working in tandem with the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, who despite the sufferings of the citizens is openly supporting the anti-people policy. “Atiku Abubakar’s remarks on the naira redesign programme were callous, insensitive and indifferent to the sufferings of the common man, and this is enough to tell you that [an] Atiku Presidency will be bad for Nigeria and Nigerians as he will pursue this kind of policies that will make life miserable for the citizens,” Suleiman said. He further stated: “Therefore, let us not give chance to Atiku Abubakar and his party, PDP, by voting massively for Tinubu and all the other offices running under APC.” Suleiman also appreciated the efforts of the APC Governors’ Forum and the leadership of the National Assembly for not only dissociating itself from the unpopular naira redesign policy but also ensuring the halting of the programme through the Supreme Court’s judgement.
