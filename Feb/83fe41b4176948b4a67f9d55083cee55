Former Akwa Ibom Governor, Godswill Akpabio and ex-police chief Udom Ekpoudom met on Monday in Uyo, the state capital. The meeting took place at the residence of Ekpoudom, a retired Deputy Inspector-General of Police. In attendance was All Progressives Congress, APC, governorship candidate Akan Udofia, who officially received the flag last week. The meeting followed the peace moves initiated by the party to reconcile Ekpoudom and Akpabio, a former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs. The duo had been enmeshed in a keen contest for the Akwa North West Senatorial ticket until the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Akpabio. In his remarks, Udofia said the meeting was that of brothers eager to embrace peace and unity for the success of their platform. The flagbearer described the parley as “a major boost” for the state chapter as it prepares for the 2023 general elections. “We met as part of ongoing efforts to unify Akwa Ibom APC as we embark on a collective journey to deliver Akwa Ibom State and entrench shared prosperity for all,” he added.
