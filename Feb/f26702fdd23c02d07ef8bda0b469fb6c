Popular reality TV star, Adekunle Olopade, has indicated an interest in becoming the host of Africa’s popular reality show, Big Brother Naija, BBNaija. The BBNaija ‘Level Up’ finalist, who applied for the role in a public post shared on his Twitter handle on Monday, declared that he is ready to replace the current host, Ebuka Obi Uchendu, in the future. Sharing the application on social media, the 27-year-old tagged the official Big Brother Africa handle to let the organisers know of his seriousness. Adekunle noted that this might be the best time to start learning how the job is done from the current host Ebuka. He wrote: “Might be time to start learning the ropes from @Ebuka. Fingers crossed, and hoping to host the Big Brother Show one day @BBNaija @DStvNg. I think it’s something I can do.”
