The presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, AAC, Omoyele Sowore, has slammed his counterpart of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar, as an opportunist. Sowore claimed that Atiku intended to capitalize on the controversies surrounding the Naira redesign policy to win election. His statement is contained in a post via his verified Twitter handle on Monday. He said the Naira redesign policy was designed to hurt poor Nigerians. “Opportunistic @atiku thought he could capitalise on the poverty-inducing Naira Design to win election. Any real leader would have known that ‘naira design’ fraud was gonna to hurt poor Nigerians. Reason I keep saying there is no difference. He’s coming to sell everything,” Sowore tweeted.
