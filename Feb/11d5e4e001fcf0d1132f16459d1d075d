The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Taraba State has suffered a great loss with 11 commissioners defecting to the main opposition party in the state, the All Progressives Congress, APC. The defection of the 11 commissioners from the ruling party in the state is coming a few hours to the rally of the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Tinubu and his running mate, Kashim Shettima in the state. A source told DAILY POST that the defectors are expected to be received into APC by President Muhammadu Buhari at the rally as the defection came less than 16 days before the presidential election. The source alleged that Deputy Governor Manir Dan’Iya has also defected to APC, a fact which has been debunked by Aminu Abubakar, his Director of Press who called on members of the PDP in the state, especially Dan’Iya’s supporters, to disregard the letter in circulation purporting his defection, describing such as the imagination of opponents who are doing their utmost to achieve selfish interests.
