The police in Ogun State have paraded the suspected killers of former Central Bank of Nigeria staff, Kehinde Fatinoye, his wife, Bukola Fatinoye and their only son, Oreoluwa Fatinoye. The suspects were paraded on Friday at the Ogun State Police Headquarters, Eleweran, Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. During the parade, the Ogun State Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed that the driver of the deceased, Lekan Adekanbi, had confessed to having hired the other two men to help him in collecting money from his boss. He said when they were with the victims, they had demanded a cash transfer and on receiving the alert, the suspects knew they could be tracked and decided to kill the couple. According to Oyeyemi, the driver, who on January 2 escaped from police custody, was traced to his elder brother in Iseyin, Oyo State, but he had left the place before the arrival of the police. The police teams, he explained, further intensified efforts and Adekanbi was apprehended in his hideout somewhere in Abeokuta on January 21. During interrogation, Adekanbi, who had been driving the victims since 2018, “confessed to being the mastermind of the dastardly act.” Oyeyemi said: “He invited the other two suspects Ahmed Odetola (aka Akamo) and Waheed Adeniyi (aka Koffi) to join him to rob the couple. “He confessed further that he took the step because the couple refused to increase his salary, and that he approached them for a loan to buy a motorcycle, but they didn’t oblige him.” He had told the police that he and his ‘hired killers’ waited for the couple to return from the New Year Crossover Service because he had access to the house, saying they “pounced on them immediately they entered the house.” He added that the Alsatian dog in the house did not attack him because the dog was very familiar with him being the person who used to feed it.
