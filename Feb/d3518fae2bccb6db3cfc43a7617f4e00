Former Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole has identified Mykhailo Mudryk as the club’s most exciting signing in the past two transfer windows, saying the Ukrainian reminds him of Arjen Robben. Chelsea have spent more than £600m on new players since the exit of Roman Abramovich from Stamford Bridge. New owner American businessman Todd Boehly does not have problems recruiting new players no matter their price tags. The likes of Mudryk, Enzo Fernandez, Noni Madueke, Joao Felix and David Datro Fofana moved to Stamford Bridge this January. “He’s going to be a top player for Chelsea,” Cole told BT Sport. “He…can beat a man, excite the crowd and has great feet. “He reminds me of Arjen Robben in the way he drives past players in short bursts and makes the right decisions in the final third.” Chelsea’s new owners led by Chairman Todd Boehly have been criticised for overpaying for players. Arsenal were negotiating to sign Mudryk for £80 million from Shakhtar Donetsk before the Blues hijacked the deal, paying £89 million for the 22-year-old. The west London side went ahead to break the British transfer record to sign Enzo Fernandez from Benfica for a fee of £106 million.
