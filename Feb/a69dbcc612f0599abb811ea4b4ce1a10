The Deputy Commandant of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, Musa Sani Bakura, has said that Nigeria recorded zero drug-related problems during last year’s Hajj pilgrimage. He said the agency had not received any complaints from the Saudi Arabian authorities of Nigerians exporting drugs or being caught with drugs. The NDLEA Chief explained that for this year’s Hajj, they had taken strong measures to ensure that no one transports drugs to the holy land, including those who export kola nuts on large scale, which is also prohibited. This is even as the Kano Pilgrims Welfare Agency commenced the 2023 Intending PilgrimsEenlightenment Campaign as the agency is said to have recorded over 70 percent deposits for the Hajj. Speaking during a mass enlightenment programme organized by the agency, the Executive Secretary, Muhammad Abba Dambatta, said that Kano State Government had done enough in ensuring that the forthcoming Hajj operations are done without hitches. Dambatta hinted that Kano had received 5,902 slots from the National Hajj Commission, NAHCON, for the 2023 exercise and out of which already about 4000 have deposited their money, showing true commitment to the programmes. The Emir of Kano, Alhaji Amin Ado Bayero, said the strong position taken by the Kano Pilgrims Welfare Agency and the government has tremendously helped in ensuring a hitch-free conduct last year. He urged the 2023 intending pilgrims to intensify prayers for Nigeria to come out safely of the multiple problems it is facing.
