Chelsea boss, Graham Potter believes Chelsea are heading in the right direction despite their UEFA Champions League last-16 first-leg 1-0 defeat against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday. Potter said Chelsea’s Champions League tie against Dortmund was complicated as they played in a hostile environment against a team that is currently in good form. Karim Adeyemi’s second-half goal gave the Bundesliga side a first-leg advantage against Chelsea at Signal Iduna Park ahead of the return leg at Stamford Bridge on March 7. “Overall, we were pleased with the performance for big parts of the game,” Potter said at his post-match press conference. “It is complicated away from home in the Champions League, in a hostile environment against a team that is in a good moment. It was an even first half, we managed the game quite well with good opportunities to counter-attack and we hit the bar. “Then in the second half, apart from the one decisive action where we did not do well enough, we were the dominant, the better team and created some good chances. We needed a little bit of luck, maybe and a little bit of final execution. It is half-time. It is a tight tie. We look forward to Stamford Bridge,” he added.
