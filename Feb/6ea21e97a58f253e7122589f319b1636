Popular Nigerian event host/Wedding MC, Derekumor Ebiaremene Claude AKA Shadow_mcfr, on Monday revealed that his father never supported his choice of becoming an MC. The event Host revealed this while responding to questions from his followers during a Question and Answer segment on his Instagram story. In his words, he said “My father did everything possible to make sure I studied law, but I failed literature for some awkward reasons twice lol”.  Shadow_mcfr further stated that he had always known he would be a prolific event MC because of his talented nature. According to him, he grew up watching the likes of Ali Baba, Basorge Tariah Jr, Ikay Osakioduwa, Ayo Makun and the likes, who have been a great source of inspiration to his brand and has always been that humorous, fun-filled and classy man. He also said that while growing up he wanted to study Mass Communication because of his passion for Public Speaking and Entertainment, but he got a hint that his father would not pay his tuition fees for that course, so he went on to study Accounting at the prestigious Novena University Ogume, Delta State where he graduated with a Second Class (upper division). He has since been a trailblazer in the Event/Wedding Industry as he has hosted well over 200 events across 20 States of the country and concluded his annual tour in December, 2022.
