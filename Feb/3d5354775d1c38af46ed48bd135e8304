Labour Party, LP, chieftain Kenneth Okonkwo has blamed the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate Bola Tinubu for President Muhammadu Buhari’s reported stoning. The President’s convoy and a chopper that flew him were targeted by angry citizens, mostly youths, in Katsina and Kano States. The APC and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, have made counter allegations, each accusing the other of sponsoring the unrest. In his reaction, Okonkwo stated that Tinubu has committed anti-party activities against APC “more than any member”. Okonkwo said the former Lagos governor accused the Nigerian leader of using fuel scarcity and naira scarcity to his scuttle ambition. “Buhari is being stoned now by citizens because of Tinubu’s utterances,” the LP member tweeted. He urged APC members to prevail on Tinubu to “step down” for Peter Obi who he described as a “competent man of character who will engender a new Nigeria.” Okonkwo, a lawyer and veteran Nollywood actor, is one of LP Presidential Campaign Council, PCC, spokespersons.
