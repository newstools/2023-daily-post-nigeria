The United States Government has said its government is not backing any individual, candidate or party, ahead of Nigeria’s general election. Molly Phee, U.S. Assistant Secretary of States for African Affairs, made this known on Wednesday, in Abuja. “Here in Nigeria, it is my impression that the fundamentals here are very strong and President Buhari has made it very clear that he would not seek a third term and that he views an important legacy of his time and tenure as President to be a peaceful transition of power. “In December, when the United States hosted the African Leaders Summit, President Biden invited a select number of Heads of State to the White House including President Buhari to discuss upcoming elections in 2023. “In that meeting, they discussed the importance and challenges of how to arrange a free and fair election that will result in a credible outcome, and how to ensure that the process is peaceful. “Last year, your government enacted electoral reforms which are very positive and have contributed, I believe to a credible electoral process “As we have learnt in the United States, successful elections require everyone to contribute, that is why as I earlier said, it is important for all Nigerians to act responsibly, and vote their conscience. “It is my understanding that Nigerians have confidence in this electoral system and they should vote with confidence that their votes will count,” Phee said.
