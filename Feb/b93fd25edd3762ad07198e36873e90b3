The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) on Sunday said contrary to reports on social media, no youth corps member participating in the general election was beaten to death. According to a statement issued by the Director, Press and Public Relations, Mr Eddy Megwa, the brutalised corps member did not die as reported but recuperated after treatment at the hospital. Megwa added that the brutality of the said corps member was a case of mistaken identity. He said, ”Indeed, a corps member deployed to LEA primary school, Lugbe, as an Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) ad-hoc staff, was brutalised by an angry mob on the suspicion that he was involved in the act of thumbprinting ballot papers in favour of one of the presidential aspirants. “To put issues in proper perspective, the brutalisation of the corps members was a case of mistaken identity. ”This was made known after an investigation by the security agencies.” He added, ”The scheme, therefore, wishes to call on Nigerians to exercise restraint on issues that concern corps members and other electoral officers on national assignment during the general elections. ”Management wishes to once again admonish corps members participating in the conduct of the general elections to ensure the highest degree of neutrality and discipline in their approach to the national assignment.”
