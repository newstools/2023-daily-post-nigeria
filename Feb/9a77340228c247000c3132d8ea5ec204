As Nigerians prepare to elect a new president and another set of National Assembly members on Saturday, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Abeokuta South Federal Constituency, Toyin Amuzu, has called for wisdom. Amuzu told the electorate to go out on Saturday and elect leaders that would take them out of poverty and hunger. The PDP candidate advised that the people should be circumspect in choosing who would represent them, saying they should not repeat the mistake of 2015 and 2019. Amuzu urged the people to recruit political leaders who would bring them the dividends of democracy and those who would have more to their present situation. The Egba chief, who decried the level of infrastructural deficit in Abeokuta South Federal constituency, assured that he would facilitate more projects to the area when elected. Speaking in Abeokuta during the launch of a community water project at Erunbe and Shodipe in Oke Ijeun area of Abeokuta South Local Government, Amuzu said he would facilitate infrastructural projects and services by paying attention to health, social security, education, agriculture, youth development and others. While lamenting what he called the level of decay in infrastructure across Abeokuta South, he observed that some communities do not have link bridges, health centres and other necessities. He promised to enact laws that would impact directly on the people, saying “the days of figurehead legislators should be put to an end through the selection of qualified representatives.” “Please vote wisely for the PDP to take yourselves out of poverty and bring dividends of democracy to your doorsteps. “Vote for Alhaji Atiku Abubakar on Saturday, vote for me as your representative and vote for Olumide Aderinokun as your Senator. Vote PDP in all the elections. Don’t forget the pains and hardships of the last eight years. Vote to be out of poverty and inadequacy,” he said.
