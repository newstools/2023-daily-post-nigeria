Chelsea legend, Gianfranco Zola, has jumped to the defence of Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen, over AS Roma manager Jose Mourinho’s comments that the Nigeria international must stop diving. Mourinho recently warned Osimhen after AS Roma’s Serie A defeat to Napoli that the former 24-year-old would need to stop diving. But Zola has now responded to Mourinho’s claims. He insisted that he sees similarities in Drogba’s playing style with that of Osimhen, adding that the Ivorian legend is too strong to dive. Zola told Sky Sports: “Because Didier [Drogba] was too strong to dive! I see a lot of similarities though.” Osimhen has been linked with a summer transfer move to the Premier League, with Chelsea and Manchester United among the contenders for the player’s signature. He currently has two years left on his Napoli contract at the end of the season.
