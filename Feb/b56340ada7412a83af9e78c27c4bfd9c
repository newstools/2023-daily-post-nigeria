Manchester United’s former defender Gary Neville has named Eddie Nketiah as the Arsenal player that has surprised him the most this season Neville hailed Nketiah, who was on his way out of the Emirates Stadium last season having struggled for game time at the club. Nketiah, who replaced injured Gabriel Jesus in Mikel Arteta’s lineup, has been quite impressive. He scored twice in Arsenal’s recent victory over Manchester United but it is his all-round game that has caught the eye. Asked which Premier League player had surprised this season, Neville told The Overlap: “I’m going to go Nketiah. I thought when Jesus got injured I thought that could be a problem. I think he’s played really well for Arsenal.”
