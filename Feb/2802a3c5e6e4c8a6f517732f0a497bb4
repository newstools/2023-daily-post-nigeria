The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, has called on the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, not to postpone the old naira regime deadline after February 10. This was disclosed in a statement issued on Wednesday by the Atiku campaign council. Atiku said vote riggers aim to push the CBN to extend the date till after the 25 February and 11 March general elections to achieve their aims. The former vice president asked the apex bank to immediately examine the measures it has put in place to ensure the circulation of the new naira notes and ease the difficulty currently faced by Nigerians, mainly the rural dwellers. Part of the statement read: “There should be no further postponement on the new naira regime after the expiration of the February 10 deadline. “The vote riggers are seeking to push the CBN to extend till after the election when they would have achieved their evil plots. “The CBN and the Presidency should be steadfast. The merits of the new naira policy far outweigh the little inconvenience we are experiencing.”
