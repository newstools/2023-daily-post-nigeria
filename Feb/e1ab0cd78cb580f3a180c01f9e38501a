Former Akwa United tactician, Rafael Everton and Henry Makinwa have applied for the vacant El-Kanemi Warriors coaching position,” DAILY POST can exclusively report. Everton, who has also managed Nigeria National League outfit, Vandrezzer FC in the past is seeking a return to the Nigeria Premier Football League. Makinwa’s last job was also with Vandrezzer FC. “I can tell you now that Makinwa and Everton, the Brazilian, have both shown interest in El Kanemi Warriors’ coaching job,” a reliable source in the club told DAILY POST. The Maiduguri club sacked their erstwhile head coach, Abubakar Hassan Mai Zubairu on Thursday following a string of poor results.
