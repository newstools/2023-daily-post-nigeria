The General Manager of Dangote Sugar, North, Abdulsalam Waya, has said with 650,000 barrels of oil per day, Dangote refinery will end the perennial fuel scarcity in Nigeria. Speaking during the Dangote Day at the ongoing 44th Kaduna International Trade Fair on Saturday, Waya explained that in a couple of months the refinery would be commissioned and will commence production. Waya, who is representing the Dangote Group, also said Dangote is the biggest employer of labour outside the government, saying the company has touched the lives of millions of Nigerians in many ways with its products. He said, “There’s no household in the country that does not patronize either Dangote sugar, salt or cement. We have equally continued to boost the nation’s economy by investing heavily on agriculture and minerals resources.” According to him, these two sectors are strategic to the growth of the economy. Also speaking, the Technical sales Manager, Dangote Cement, Oligie Friday, said the company exports cement to 14 African countries. He also said they provide over 5,000 direct jobs and as well never default in paying tax. While speaking at the fair, the Assistant General Manager, Sales and Marketing, Dangote Fertilizer, Agbana Issac Oladele, remarked that his company now produced 3million tons of fertilizers for both local consumption and export. Oladele said further, “We have not only improved crop production for Nigerian farmers, we have made the market very attractive and competitive.”
