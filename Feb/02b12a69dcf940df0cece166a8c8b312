Senate President Ahmad Lawan on Sunday said it was misrepresentation and outright fabrication that the APC zonal campaign rally in Gashua, Bade Local Government Area in Yobe State was marred by violence. Lawan, in a statement issued by his Special Adviser, Media, Ola Awoniyi on Sunday in Abuja, was reacting to media reports of alleged violence on Saturday, 11th February 2023. He urged members of the public to disregard the said report as it was concocted out of malice, claiming that the success of the rally infuriated his political enemies. He said: “The offensive reports insinuated that there was a disruption of the rally by a particular group of supporters. The report also alleged that some party leaders were stoned at the rally. “The facts are that the people of Yobe North Senatorial District otherwise referred to as Zone C turned out en masse for the rally in demonstration of their love for the All Progressives Congress (APC) and particularly to show their appreciation of the achievements of the State Governor, His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni in the last three and half years of his administration.” The large size and enthusiasm of the crowd, according to him was a show of solidarity and support for their son, whose candidacy for the Yobe North Senatorial District has just been affirmed by a judgement of the Supreme Court. Said he: “The rally was a further demonstration that the relationship between the people of Yobe North and the Governor is as solid as ever before. It also shows that the APC is both united and solid in the zone.”
