Islamic group, Muslim Rights Concern, MURIC, on Saturday appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene in the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) Naira redesign policy. The group’s Director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, made the appeal in a statement in Lagos. Akintola also urged Buhari to abide by the Supreme Court’s pronouncement on the naira note swap. Akintola said, “Millions of Nigerians have been going through excruciating pain, hunger and starvation since the Nigerian fiscal crisis began. “Thousands of Nigerians are, therefore, forced to go without food. Transporters have refused to take the old notes, and commuters are stranded.” Akintola added, “Apart from this, Mr President must find a way of abiding by the decision of the Supreme Court, which earlier ruled that the old and new currencies should run parri passu.” DAILY POST reports that this is coming less than two days after Buhari’s nationwide address to Nigerians amid the naira scarcity.
