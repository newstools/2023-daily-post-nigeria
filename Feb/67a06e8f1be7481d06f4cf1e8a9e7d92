The governorship candidate of the People’s Redemption Party, PRP, in Cross Rivers State, Pastor Usani Usani on Friday, narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. Usani, a former minister of Niger Delta Affairs, was travelling on the Calabar-Ikom federal highway in the afternoon around the Biase LGA axis when his car was waylaid by heavily armed men. His assailants, however, did not recognise him and killed two unidentified innocent men and grabbed about 15 other travellers and dragged them into the nearby forest. Usani’s media aide, David Agabi was with the former minister in his car when the incident happened. “We were heading towards Yakurr LGA where the governorship candidate hails from in continuation of his political activity. But around Betem community in Biase LGA of the state, we were waylaid by an armed gang in the opposite direction. “They swooped on a white posh car, killing two occupants while large numbers of other passengers were abducted and taken away alongside one Mr Egbe Eworo Essiet. “They mistook the former minister’s car which was next to the white car but shot the driver. Apparently, they did not quite ascertain who Usani was”, Agabi said in a telephone interview. Between November 2022 and today, there are reports that more than 20 people have been kidnapped and a number of persons killed on the same axis. On Wednesday, the Commissioner for Women’s Affairs in the state, Prof Gertrude Njar was kidnapped and reportedly taken across the Calabar creeks. Another political aide, Kenneth Abang was kidnapped a week before alongside his cousin. However, the Commissioner of Police in the state, Sule Balarabe, days ago paraded 21 suspects, including those linked to the reported kidnaps. He has said the security networks are up to the task and will pick up all the suspects.
