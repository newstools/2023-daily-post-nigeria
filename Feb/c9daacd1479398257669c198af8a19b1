The Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has said that the Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir el-Rufai only stated the obvious when he said some elements in Aso Rock are working against the victory of the APC candidate, Bola Tinubu. El-Rufai made the allegation while featuring on Sunrise Daily, a breakfast programme on Channels television. Reacting to what el-Rufai said at the launch of the “ThinkingCaps” app, aimed at gaining the support of the youth for the Tinubu-Shettima ticket, the Special Adviser, Media and Public Affairs, Mr Dele Alake, said the governor’s comment was self-explanatory. He explained that there was nothing spectacular about what el-Rufai said. Alake explained that in all institutions, you cannot have 100 per cent of all the operatives in an organisation seeing issues exactly the same way. His words: “He did say that some people, but he never said the president and in any organisation, including your own individual media houses, you have your editorial policy and there [are] elements within your organisations that don’t agree with [the] editorial policy but they still work there.” Alake stressed that it is the preponderance of views that matters. According to him: “Now, in terms of the presidency, who is the power base? It’s the Commander-in-Chief, he holds all the aces. We do not expect that all his staff will actually see eye-to-eye with him, but they are still there. But again, you also need perspective from various angles.” Alake, however, said the campaign was aware that the opposition Peoples Democratic Party would twist it out of context. He added: “So, for el-Rufai, the governor of Kaduna State stating the obvious is nothing to glare about. We know that the mischief makers, the opposition would latch on to it and twist it out of context. But that is the way of the opposition, especially the opposition that we are contending with in Nigeria today.”
