A young lady, identified as Promise Ekong, from Boki Local Government Area of Cross River State, has been reported dead. DAILY POST gathered that Promise, who completed her National Youth Service Corps, NYSC, compulsory programme three months ago, died in Stanzel Hotel, 5th Avenue, Gwarinpa area of Abuja. Management of the hotel had claimed that Promise drowned in their swimming pool. However, the incident which occurred on February 8 has been shrouded with controversy as the family of the victim disagreed with the hotel management, suggesting foul play. When contacted by DAILY POST, the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Josephine Adeh, confirmed the development. She said the incident was reported at the Gwarimpa Divisional Police Headquarters by one Abang Paul, a male resident of SNCO 1 Lungi Barracks Abuja. According to the PPRO, the 21-year-old Promise was reportedly swimming in a pool at the hotel before it was noticed that she suddenly stopped moving. “Upon receipt of the information, a Team of Crime scene investigators (CSI) swung into action and visited the scene of the incident. Ekong was rushed to the hospital, where she was sadly confirmed dead. “The deceased has been deposited at the mortuary and an investigation into situations surrounding the unfortunate incident has commenced. Developments will be subsequently communicated”, she added.
