Justice Obiora Egwuatu of the Federal High Court in Abuja has adjourned ruling on the bail application filed by Ali Bello, nephew of the Kogi Governor, Yahaya Bello. Bello and four others are being prosecuted in a N3 billion money laundering trial. They are Abba Adauda, Yakubu Siyaka Adabenege, Iyada Sadat and Rashida Bello. At the resumed proceedings on Tuesday, defence counsel, Ahmed Raji, SAN, informed the court of two motions filed on February 7. The motions sought the withdrawal and replacement of the initial applications of January 26 on behalf of the defendants. Raji prayed the court to grant the first defendant and the rest bail “on the most liberal terms” as they “are law-abiding citizens”. Prosecution counsel, Kabiru Hussini, relying on a seven-paragraph counter affidavit, faulted Raji’s claims. “The defendants have every tendency to jump bail, because they have all the influence, resources and power to intimidate our witnesses and tamper with evidence,” he said. Justice Egwuatu adjourned to February 20 for ruling on the bail application. Bello and others were docked on February 8 on 18-count charges bordering on criminal misappropriation and money laundering to the tune of N3,081,804,654.
