The Nigerian Army on Thursday reacted to the alleged killing of a soldier by a policeman in Lagos State. This is contained in a statement signed by the 81 Division Nigerian Army, Deputy Director of Public Relations, Lt.-Col. Olabisi Ayeni. Recall that an angry mob at Ogijo Community, a border town between Ogun and Lagos States, on Wednesday, attacked a police station following the death of a soldier who was allegedly stabbed to death by a policeman. Ayeni said the victim (soldier) allegedly confronted the suspect (policeman), who was not properly dressed and was standing very close to a patrol vehicle of Operation MESA to confirm his identity. “This led to an argument and, subsequently, the unfortunate incident. “The soldier was immediately rushed to the Lagos State Polytechnic Hospital, Odogunyan, for medical attention, but he was declared dead on arrival at the hospital. “The remains of the soldier have been moved to 174 Battalion Medical Centre in Ikorodu,” the army spokesperson said. He said the suspect was arrested and kept in military custody for his safety and subsequently handed over to the Nigeria police for prosecution. “However, the angry mob who witnessed the unfortunate incident took advantage of this and attacked the police station in the community. “Troops have been deployed around the vicinity of all police stations in the Ikorodu area to prevent a breakdown of law and order. “The situation is under control as normalcy has returned to the community,” Ayeni said.
