A High Court in Port Harcourt has sentenced two former members of the disbanded Special Anti Robbery Squad, SARS, to death by hanging for extra-judicial killing. Five members of the Anti Robbery Squad, Shedrack Ibibo, ASP Samuel Chigbu, Magus Awuri, Olisa Emeka and Ogoligo, were standing trial for the murder of Michael Igwe,and Michael Akor while in their custody for allegedly stealing recharge cards in 2015 in Oyigbo Local Government Area of the State. But Ogoligo and ASP Samuel Chigbu died in custody at the Port Harcourt correctional centre while Shedrack Ibibo, Olisa Emeka and Magus Awuri continued with the trial. In her judgement, Justice M.O Opara, the trial judge, found Magus Awuri and Shedrack Ibibo guilty of conspiracy to murder, while Olisa Emeka was acquitted. The state prosecution council, speaking to newsmen after the judgment, expressed happiness, saying justice has been served. She said, “The court found that the duo were guilty of murdering the two deceased. The court discharged and acquitted Olisa Emeka based on the findings because the prosecution did not prove his case concerning the last person. “It will hopefully serve as a deterrent to other officers and give some sort of closure to the families of the deceased persons.” Also expressing happiness over the judgment, Kathrine Akoro, mother to one of those murdered, said the policemen would now experience a taste of their own medicine. “They carried our property in 2011 and killed my son. My son said I should forgive them, let them go and bring back those things they took. I will be okay. I thank God for fighting for me. I am happy.”
