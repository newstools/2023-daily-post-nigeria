The presidential candidate of All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu on Wednesday met with Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State ahead of his campaign rally. Tinubu met with Wike at Government House, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, accompanied by members of the APC Presidential Campaign Council, PCC. Barely two weeks to the presidential election, there are feelers that Wike has pitched his tent with Tinubu. While he is yet to openly declare his support for the APC flagbearer, Wike is alleged to have directed all his cabinet members, aides and local government chairmen in the state to support Tinubu. Wike, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has refused to support his party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, after PDP’s primary election in 2022.
