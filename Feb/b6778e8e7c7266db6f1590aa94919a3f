The Nigerian Export Promotion Council, NEPC, said the agency would surpass $4.8 billion in revenue it generated in 2022. Ekiti State Coordinator, NEPC, Mrs Iyabode Abe, disclosed that the Council, under the leadership of the Chief Executive Officer, Yakusak Ezra, would continue to promote the country’s non-oil sector. Abe spoke in Ado Ekiti at a-one day technical and training session on product packaging for exporters and Small and Medium Enterprises in Ekiti State. “Over $4.82 billion revenue was generated from the non-oil export business in the year 2022 as a result of the agency’s effort in promoting non-oil export, which scales up the Gross Domestic Product, GDP economy of the country by 15 per cent,” she said. Nigeria, through NEPC, has continued to gear up efforts to boost revenue generation from the non-oil sector.
