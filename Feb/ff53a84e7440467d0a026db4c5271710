The All Progressives Congress, APC, has said that the Labour Party, LP, is actually working for the emergence Bola Tinubu as the next President of Nigeria. Appearing on Arise Television’s The Morning Show, on Monday, the APC spokesperson, APC Presidential Campaign Council, PCC, North Central, Prince Mustapha Audu, also named some of the States he thinks Bola Tinubu and Shettima would record a landslide victory. Audu was specifically responding to a spokesperson of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP’s presidential campaign cannot, PCC, Dele Momodu, who on the same programme yesterday, said that Atiku Abubakar and Okowa would win all 19 states in the North. “The PDP is used to their false statements and fallacies but it’s clear if you look at the dynamics in Kogi State where I come from the Bola Tinubu and Shettima will certainly win,” Audu said. “They’ll win Kwara, Niger, more Northern States, if you look at the North West, North East, Kano, Taraba, Yobe, he’ll clearly win. “And this is not a two-party as per se although only two parties stand to win. All the other presidential candidates, especially the Labour Party, stand to get more from the PDP. “The Labour Party has worked best for the APC. The South East that has not been our stronghold the Labour will take a lot of votes from the PDP there. Abuja where we’ve never been so strong, Labour is doing so well in PDP strongholds. I think the Labour Party is working very hard for APC. “If you look at Rivers State that produces the most votes for the PDP in all the elections there’s disarray in the PDP and this also works for us.”
