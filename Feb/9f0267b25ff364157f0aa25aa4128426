A young woman in Adamawa State, 22-year-old Philomena Chilion, her boyfriend and one other man have been remanded in prison over the rape of a pastor’s daughter. The trio are facing the charge of criminal conspiracy, abatement and rape. The Chief Magistrate Court 3 in Yola, Adamawa State, remanded the lady, her boyfriend, Abubakar Umar and Ibrahim Abubakar over the said offence. Philomena of Chigari in Fufore Local Government Area and her boyfriend, Abubakar of Njoboli Fulani, in Yola South LGA, are accused of conspiring with Ibrahim Abubakar who allegedly raped the pastor’s 20-year-old daughter. Information on the matter has it that Ibrahim Abubakar who also hails from Njoboli Fulani, raped his 20-year-old victim during the Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria (LCCN) Convention held in Yola town last month. It was learnt that Philomena asked her friend to accompany her to collect an item from somebody outside the convention ground by 9:00pm of that day, January 29, and that both of them met the two young men who waited for them in a tricycle outside. A source said the men asked them to accompany them to a particular place, and ended up conveying the girls to Njoboli Fulani, about 10 kilometers away from the convention ground. On arriving in Njoboli Fulani where both men live, Umar held his girlfriend and went to his room, leaving behind pastor’s daughter and Ibrahim in the tricycle. Few minutes later, a young man met pastor’s daughter and Ibrahim in the tricycle and asked them to get down from the tricycle. On getting down, Ibrahim asked his victim to go with him to his room, where he had intercourse with her twice and where they spent the entire night while other worshippers passed the night at the convention ground. On their arraignment in court, the three defendants denied the charge against them, and the court, presided over by Chief Magistrate Uwani Garba, ordered that they be remanded in prison custody, and adjourned the matter to next Thursday, February 23.
