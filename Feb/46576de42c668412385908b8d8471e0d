The Western Nigeria Security Network code-named Amotekun Ekiti State has arrested a 50-year-old man, Celestine Nwoha, with fake naira notes. Addressing newsmen in Ado Ekiti, the commander of the corps, Retired Brigadier Joe Komolafe, said the suspect was arrested in Omuo Ekiti, Ekiti East Local Government. He said: ”The suspect went to a local area in Omuo and started spending the money before we got a hint and went after him. “He said he specializes in buying kola and bitter kola, saying he was also paid with the cash in Lagos. “On interrogation, he confessed to the crime and said he was given N250,000 from a factory in Lagos, but only N100,000 was found with him as he had spent some.” Komolafe said the command would hand him over to the police for further investigation. Brigadier Komolafe urged members of the public to be careful, especially during the current cash crunch, so as not to fall victim.
