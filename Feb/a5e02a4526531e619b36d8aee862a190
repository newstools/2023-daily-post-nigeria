President Muhammadu Buhari has said he identifies and empathises with Nigerians on the difficulties they are experiencing as a result of the ongoing cash crunch â€“ a fallout of the Naira redesign policy. In a nationwide broadcast on Thursday, Buhari said he seeks understanding and patience from Nigerians and that he is committed to his oath of advancing the interest of Nigerians at all times. The President said the policy becomes necessary to restore the statutory control of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, over money in circulation. His broadcast to Nigerians is coming amidst the worsening scarcity of the new Naira notes. Angry citizens piled up pressure on Wednesday, with protests taking place simultaneously across the country. Apart from attacks on some financial institutions, deaths have also been recorded as security agencies try to quell the uprising. DAILY POST recalls that before the February 10 deadline, President Buhari has asked Nigerians to give his government one week to resolve the issues arising from the scarcity of the Naira notes.
