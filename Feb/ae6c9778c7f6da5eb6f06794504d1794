OGC Nice manager, Didier Digard has showered encomium on Terem Moffi after the forward opened his goal account for the club. Moffi scored twice and provided an assist in Les Aiglons 3-0 win against AS Monaco on Sunday. It was the striker’s first goal since he linked up with the modest club from Lorient last month. The 23-year-old has struggled in front of goal since the move but repaid the club’s faith with a breathtaking performance at the Stade Louis 11. Digard, who was happy with Moffi’s performance said he never doubted the player. “Once again, I never doubted him. The main thing is that he had the support of all his teammates and his coaches,” Digard told reporters. “We were aware of the situation and he could have had doubts, but he was able to work very calmly and feel the confidence everyone had in him.” Moffi has scored 14 goals in Ligue this season.
