Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State has denied supporting the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. Ikpeazu was reacting to claims by the Senate chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, that he was backing Tinubu’s presidency. He spoke while addressing journalists after inspecting the ongoing final asphalt overlay on Faulks Road, Aba. Appearing on Channels Television on Monday, Kalu said Ikepazu will support Tinubu and his senatorial district will give the APC flag bearer “the 34, 35 per cent to be on the ballot.” However, Ikpeazu described Kalu’s remark as mere speculation and wishful thinking. According to Ikpeazu: “No member of G5 can railroad another member into supporting anyone against his will as suggested by Senator Kalu”.
