Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has insisted that Nigerians would reward his hard work by voting for him to be the country’s next president. The former Lagos State Governor stated this while speaking with newsmen after casting his vote at the polling unit 085, ward 3, Alausa, Ikeja in Lagos. Tinubu said, “I’m very confident. I traversed the country sometimes four times and attended town hall meetings and various interest groups. “I’ve attended to their request and I’ve worked harder than any other candidate in this country. I believe Nigeria will reward me, they’ll reward my hard work.” DAILY POST reports that Tinubu was accompanied by his wife, Sen. Oluremi. The APC flagbearer cast his vote around 10:25am amidst a massive crowd at his polling unit.
