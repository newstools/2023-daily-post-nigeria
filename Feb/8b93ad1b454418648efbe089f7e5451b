The Nigeria Labour Congress has settled for a consensus candidate to succeed Comrade Ayuba Wabba who is bowing out of office as president of the apex labour union in Nigeria. Wabba has served out two terms of four years each. He became NLC President in 2015 after an election that was marred with controversies. To this end the 13th Quadrennial National Delegates Conference of the union has been fixed for Tuesday 7th February 2023 at the International Conference Centre Abuja. Wabba’s first term as President of NLC was marred by crisis from opposing factions, which contested the election but lost out. It took the efforts of past leaders of the union to broker truce between the warring factions, a development that culminated in the bringing on board of Joe Ajaero, General Secretary of the National Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE) as Deputy National President. There are indications that the National Administrative Council of the NLC may have settled for Ajaero to succeed Wabba. The theme for the 13th Quadrennial National Delegates Conference is “Building Peoples’ Power, National Unity and Quest for a New Social Contract”. The event which sometimes become a rallying point for political office seekers to sell their mandate is expected to attract local and foreign dignitaries, including the former NLC President, Adams Oshiomhole.
