The Federal Capital Territory Administration, FCTA, has assured Abuja residents of safety during and after the general elections. The Presidential and National Assembly elections will be held on Saturday; restriction of movement is effective midnight. Director of Information, Muhammad Hazat-Sule said the FCT security committee met on Thursday on election security. The team urged residents to come out en masse to exercise their civic responsibility without fear. He confirmed adequate security arrangements for officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, and others. The committee appealed to citizens to conduct themselves in a lawful manner during the exercise and vote for candidates of their choice. “All potential flashpoints that could lead to the breach of peace have been carefully mapped out and appropriate surveillance measures have been put in place to maintain law and order,” he said. Sule further announced restriction of commuter movements around the International Conference Centre, Abuja. The FCTA approved the venue as the INEC Collation Centre for the 2023 presidential election.
