Alhaji Abubakar Kwaire, a special adviser to Gov. Aminu Tambuwal, has decamped from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to the All Progressives Congress, APC, ahead of the 2023 general elections in the state. Kwaire, according to a statement by Bashar Abubakar, the Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to Sen. Aliyu Wamakko (APC, Sokoto North), was received by the state APC governorship candidate, Alhaji Ahmad Aliyu in Sokoto. Kwaire’s decision to join APC, according to him, was motivated by Wamakko’s leadership qualities. “Therefore, I believe with Wamakko as APC leader and Aliyu to govern our state, if elected, more dividends of democracy are expected,” he said. In his remarks, the governorship candidate welcomed the defector and assured him of equal treatment like all other members of the party. Kwaire, a former member of the Sokoto State House of Assembly, hailed from Tambuwal Local Government.
