The presidential election collation of the Peoples Democratic Party, Dino Melaye has accused Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu of having rigged the presidential election Dino Melaye spoke to journalists at the International Conference Centre, ICC’s Collation Centre of the national electoral body after he and other party agents, including the Labour Party agent staged a work out from the collation process. Melaye pointed out that the BVAS was not used at various areas during the Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections, alleging mass thumb-printing by the All Progressives Congress, APC, at different polling units by the help of INEC. He also lamented that the electoral umpire has failed to upload results on its server since after the conduct of the election on Saturday. “We party agents, having observed that the INEC Chairman is determined to rig and manipulate the election by making sure that results are not uploaded by vehemently making a statement that makes it look like we’re all here to rubberstamp the fraud that has already been rigged between INEC and APC. “We are saying we are not here to rubber-stamp the fraud. We are Nigerians and we all know that there’s no one on the server and he is now saying we should wait for the process to be completed before it can be reviewed. “Knowing fully well that once a declaration is done there can’t be any review but court. So we are completely disassociating ourselves that’s why we staged a workout. We have records of where BVAS were not used but results were pronounced. “They cannot upload results because they know that what they will present will be in variance to what they are showing Nigerians. INEC has rigged the electoral process. The 2023 election has been rigged.”
