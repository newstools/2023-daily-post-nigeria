Former Liverpool striker, Michael Owen, has named Southampton’s James Ward-Prowse as the best free-kick taker in football history. Owen, analyzing the Saints’ 1-0 win at Chelsea on Saturday, said he could not think of a better player from a dead ball. Ward-Prowse scored the only goal of the match with a superb free-kick in the first half. He has now scored 17 direct free kicks in the Premier League and is only behind Manchester United legend David Beckham, who has 18. “We can talk about Messi, Ronaldo and other players. “But Ward-Prowse is unbelievable,” Owen said.
