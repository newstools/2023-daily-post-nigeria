Barely three weeks to the presidential election, a former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has said Bola Tinubu the candidate of All Progressives Congress, APC, is unstoppable. Fani-Kayode said presidential candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and Labour Party and fifth columnists from the Presidential Villa plotting against Tinubu can’t stop him. He also noted that traitors and the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, can’t come in between Tinubu and President Muhammadu Buhari. In a series of tweets, Fani-Kayode wrote: “The few in the Villa plotting against @Official AbAT can’t stop him. @atiku and @Peter Obi can’t stop him. ING can’t stop him. CBN can’t stop him. “Traitors can’t stop him, and neither can ANY of them come between him and @MBuhari. “We are taking you ALL on and we shall prevail!” DAILY POST recalls that Tinubu had accused some forces in the Presidential Villa of sabotaging his campaign. Tinubu lamented that the fuel scarcity and CBN naira swap policy were aimed against him. Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State also corroborated Tinubu’s allegation. El-Rufai said some forces in the Presidential Villa against Tinubu’s emergence as APC flagbearer are working to sabotage his campaign.
