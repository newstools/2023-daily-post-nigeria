Former Liverpool defender, Jose Enrique, has questioned if manager Jurgen Klopp is in any danger of being sacked by the club’s owner. Enrique said this while reacting to Liverpool’s embarrassing Premier League 3-0 defeat to Wolves on Saturday. Goals from Joel Matip (OG), Craig Dawson, and Ruben Neves ensured Wolves defeated Liverpool at Molineux Stadium. The result means Liverpool are now in 10th position on the Premier League table with 29 points from 20 games. In a tweet via his Twitter handle, Enrique said, “Better second half but another very, very disappointed performance from the team and more worrying thing is that I don’t see us improving this season. You can lose but no the way we are losing with no desire and intensity. “Is Klopp in any danger to be sacked with this owners?”
