Manchester City have been charged by the Premier League with over 100 breaches of financial rules. This comes at the end of a four-year investigation. The Premier League, in a statement on Monday, alleged that the breaches came over nine seasons, from 2009 to 2018. During that period, City won the Premier League three times. The Premier League noted that the alleged breaches referred to “inaccurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club’s financial position” in particular its “revenue”, “sponsorship revenue” and “operating costs”. City have been referred to an independent commission, and if the club is found guilty of the charges, the punishment could range from a possible points deduction to a possible expulsion from the Premier League.
