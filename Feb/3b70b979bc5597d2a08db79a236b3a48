An economic advisory group, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, UNECA, has projected Africa’s economy to reach 1,977.6 billion dollars by 2030 through the Continent’s use of renewable energy. On Sunday, Mr Antonio Pedro, the Acting Executive Secretary of UNECA, said this at the Fifth African Science, Technology and Innovation Forum in Niamey, Niger. He disclosed that a 10 per share could add $200 billion to the Continent’s economy. He called on the Continent to key into the opportunity available in the digital economy, estimated to be worth $14.5 trillion. “A significant opportunity for us lies in the renewable energy market. The value in this market in 2020 was estimated at $881.7 billion and is projected to reach $1,977.6 billion by 2030”, he stated.
