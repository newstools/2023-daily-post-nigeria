The national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Iyorchia Ayu, has made a gaffe on Thursday during the party’s presidential campaign held in Kano State. Ayu said that the PDP had brought shame and should not be retained in power. He intended to mean the All Progressives Congress, APC. One of the spokespersons for the Tinubu-Shettima Presidential Campaign Council, Festus Keyamo, posted the video clip on his verified Twitter handle. “In Kano today, Iyorchia Ayu, the PDP National Chairman, confessed that PDP has brought shame and we should not retain them in power. “This obvious costly slip-of-tongue will not make any headlines. Watch out for some press reports on this!,” he tweeted. See video below https://twitter.com/fkeyamo/status/1623734878658347008?t=rLKVe02uvWrqsbnk3iMUmw&s=19
