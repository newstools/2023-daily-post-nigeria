Following the continued arguments over political support in the 2023 elections, Nigerian singer, Peter Okoye, has stated that Seun Kuti, a Nigerian musician and youngest son of the Afrobeat pioneer, Fela Anikulapo Kuti is irrelevant without his father’s name. Peter blasted Seun in a series of posts shared on his Twitter handle on Wednesday. Trouble started when Seun referred to the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi as an opportunist. Peter Okoye had rushed to Obi’s defence triggering a back and forth which led to Seun accusing him and his twin brother of campaigning for president Buhari in 2015. In his response, Peter said, ”We PSQUARE have never campaigned for any Presidential candidates before now except for PETER OBI. Did we perform for President Buhari during his inauguration in 2015 YES. He was already the President! GO AND VERIFY. ”My late Father was a nobody, but today everyone knows the OKOYES. Dude, try removing “KUTI” from your name let me see if you are relevant. ”Remain in that your Local SHRINE while people like us and others continue excelling Globally. YOU CAN’T SHAME THE SHAMELESS. You had no music career in the first place. All you do is brag about your family background.”
