Amid the tension in the country over the presidential election results being announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide has appealed for calm. There is anger in several parts of the country, with voters alleging that the result being announced was different from the outcome at the various polling units. In a statement made available to journalists on Tuesday, the National President of the Igbo group, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike urged the youths to remain calm and not take actions that could inflame the nation. He said the remarks credited to Mr. Peter Obi of the Labour Party, wherein he urged his supporters to remain calm, was reassuring. Okwu said it was better to explore legal options “than take actions than would set the entire country ablaze. “We have it on good authority that some people are already waiting for an opportunity to hide under protests and attack some individuals and loot their properties. “I implore our people not to give such people the chance to carry out their well-orchestrated evil. I’m passionately begging the youths to please remain calm. “We can feel the anger and the pulse of the masses, but legal options still remain the best way to go. May we not create room for criminals who would hijack such protests.” He, however, urged the INEC to set up a panel and review all the controversial results in order to assuage the feelings of the citizens.
