Amid the naira scarcity saga in Nigeria, Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has said the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Godwin Emefiele is not a member of the All Progressives Congress, APC. El-Rufai said the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, appointed Emefiele as CBN governor. The Governor spoke in an interview with BBC Hausa while reacting to the naira crisis being witnessed in Nigeria. El-Rufai said the identity of those working with Emefiele would be revealed at the right time. According to El-Rufai: “You see Godwin Emefiele, the PDP brought him and the rest of those who are being harassed, we know when the time comes, we will reveal their names because they are not members of the party, they are blue-collar people. “If we had voted for them, we would have revealed their names. “They are people who want to bring down the party that gave them the opportunity and they got more money than shopping for their games.”
