As the focus shifted to Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections results, Nigerians have continued to lament the untold hardship of the Naira currency following the Central Bank of Nigeria’s currency redesign policy. According to Nigerians in the Federal Capital Territory, Delta, Edo, Kaduna, Niger, Nasarawa and Abia, and other states have not hidden their frustrations. Benjamin Okoro in Delta State lamented that while results continue to trickle in, the scarcity of Naira has become unbearable. “We will not feed on the election results; the situation of the Naira crisis is significantly affecting my family and me. I wish the government could do something quickly,” he said. Esther Elebeke, a resident of FCT, said she could not fathom why the federal government cannot tackle the naira crisis despite the ongoing election. “It is frustrating, we went to the polls with an empty stomach. Nigerians have done their part to be patient but have no tangible assistance from the government. It is terrible,” she lamented. Godwin Edwin said, “the Federal government, indeed the economy, is sleeping following Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections in addition to Naira scarcity”.
