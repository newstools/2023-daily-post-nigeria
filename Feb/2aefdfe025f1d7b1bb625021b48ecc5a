The All Progressives Congress (APC) Senatorial candidate in Edo North, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has won his polling unit. Oshiomhole, according to the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, scored 479 votes to beat his closest rival and the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Sen. Francis Alimikhena, who polled 39 votes, while the Labour Party candidate, got 5 votes. The former Edo State governor had earlier decried the late arrival of electoral materials in the Etsako Federal Constituency. The former APC National Chairman noted that the electorate promised not to vote if all the materials are not made available. He said, “INEC rule is that where an election could not take place because of their own fault, it has to be repeated either the following day or another assigned for it. So, they cannot get away with it, we are ready for a long distance run.”
