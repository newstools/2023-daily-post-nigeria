The Peoples Democratic Party House of Representatives candidate in Remo, Ogun State, Bola Oluwole, has denied claims that he sponsored the violent protest that rocked Sagamu over cash scarcity on Monday. DAILY POST reported that an aide of Governor Dapo Abiodun, Emmanuel Ojo, had accused the PDP candidate of sponsoring violent protests in Sagamu over the scarcity of new naira notes. Reacting, Oluwole said the accusation was aimed at tarnishing his reputation ahead of Saturday’s elections. He said: “My attention has been drawn to a broadcast message circulating around that I masterminded the violent protest in Sagamu Remo. This action is the handiwork of opposition in the ruling party, APC, who were hellbent on destroying and smearing my image. They are afraid of my growing popularity as we approach the 2023 general elections on Saturday.” The PDP member stated that he was not in any way connected to the protest, saying Nigerians are only angry over the nation’s economic hardship and their inability to access their money and the lingering fuel scarcity. Oluwole stated further: “As of yesterday evening, our presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, met with all National Assembly candidates to strategise for the election; so where will I have the chance to mobilise for the violent protest?” He condemned the attacks on commercial banks in Sagamu and appealed to youths to shun violent activities and be patient. Addressing the accusation levelled against him by members of APC, he said: “I want to urge the general public and the people of my constituency to disregard the message and go about their daily activities in peace.”
