A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Adetokunbo Pearse, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari on the naira redesign policy. The senior lecturer is a member of the PDP National Presidential Campaign Council, PCC, for Atiku Abubakar. In a statement made available to DAILY POST on Saturday, Pearse said the President did not allege all politicians are mopping up the new currency. “What he said is that due to the shortage of new notes, politicians who customarily buy votes on Election Day are frustrated.” The politician noted that Buhari’s apology for the hardship caused by the withdrawal of old denominations “is appropriate and acceptable”. Pearse, who leads Atiku-Okowa Support Groups in Lagos, said no one is happy with the situation of petroleum shortage and cash crunch. He appealed to Nigerians to understand the issue, bear with the government and endure the pain caused by the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, policy. The politician described the situation a case of “short term pain for long term gain” that would eventually benefit the masses. “If this is the price we have to pay for an improved economy, more credible elections, and a more secure society, then so be it. “Notice that the loudest protest is coming from corrupt politicians who are well known for vote buying, and election rigging.” Corroborating Buhari’s assurance that there is an end in sight for the discomfort, Pearse said things will return to normal immediately after the general polls. The President is facing criticisms from stalwarts of his party. Governor Nasir El-Rufai claimed the naira redesign was a plot to scuttle the ambition of APC presidential candidate Bola.
