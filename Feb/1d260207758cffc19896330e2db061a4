The Zamfara State government has declared that it is determined to collaborate with relevant stakeholders in the implementation of policies that will protect women and girls from Gender Based Violence (GBV). This was disclosed by the State deputy Governor, Senator Hassan Nasiha Mohammed Gusau at a workshop organized by the State Hisbah Commission, in collaboration with Development Research and Project Centre and Federation of Muslim Women of Nigeria (FOMWAN). The occasion was a one-day step down workshop on the role of the State Hisbah Commission in Protecting women and girls from Gender-Based Violence, using Islamic perspectives. Senator Gusau, who was represented by Hon. Abubakar Mailafiya Mada, noted that the State already had some existing Islamic laws that ensured the rights of women and children were protected against violence and intimidation. In his speech, Secretary to the State Government, Hon. Kabiru Balarabe, represented by Permanent Secretary, Dr. Barira Ibrahim Bagobiri explained that religion has already protected women and children against any form of violence. Speaking earlier, the Executive Director GRPC, Dr. Abdullahi Maiwada said the program was initiated to scale up the campaign against Gender-Based Violence which had continued to affect the social lives of people, stressing that it equally affects both male and female populations. “Reducing the menace of Gender-Based Violence is a collective responsibility. “Women are most affected as one in every three women suffer violence directly or indirectly, hence the need for authorities to do the needful towards changing the narrative,” he said. In a goodwill message, the Emir of Gusau, Dr. Ibrahim Bello, represented by Senior District Head, Bashir Kabir Danbaba suggested application of other measures in punishing offenders instead of jailing culprits, stressing that even Prison Service has been renamed “correctional services”.
