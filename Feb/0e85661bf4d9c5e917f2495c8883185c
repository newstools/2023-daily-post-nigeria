The Big Brother Titans housemate, Miracle OP, once again on Saturday made another pass at fellow housemate Khosi. Miracle OP was turned down again for the second time after he approached Khosi for a relationship on Saturday night. Their conversation: Miracle: “I’m trying to be with you, not flirt with you like others.” Khosi: “I know I’m not the only girl you have tried to be with in this house. My answer is no.” Miracle: “I embarrassed myself publicly on camera because of you in front of 43 countries.” Khosi: “There is a difference between you and Yemi. Yemi might be a flirt, but he knows what he wants. Yemi had other female interests, but I’m his main priority. “But you have been going round asking every girl out in this house.” Yemi Cregx and Miracle OP earlier had a heated argument after the two seemed to have been fighting for Khosi’s attention.
