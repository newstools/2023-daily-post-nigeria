Armed bandits have shot a 38-year-old farmer in Maro, Kajuru Local government Area of Kaduna State. A community leader, Mr. Simon John told DAILY POST in Kajuru on Friday, that the bandits were riding on motorcycles, passing through a lonely part to their destinations, when they saw the farmer tilling and clearing his farmland when they opened fire on him. DAILY POST recalls that bandits have been terrorising and killing innocent people in remote villages such as; Maro, Chibiya, Karamai, Maikori and Ungwan Gamo. Some locals in these villages have relocated while others who have no other place to go continue to live in fear. The Kaduna Police Public Relations Officer, DSC Mohammed Jalige did not pick his calls to confirm the reported shooting.
