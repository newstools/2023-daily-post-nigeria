The All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate for Oyo South Senatorial District in the 25th February election, Sharafadeen Abiodun Alli has claimed the APC is the only party with the best candidates in the 2023 general elections in the state. Alli, a former Secretary to the Oyo State government, made the disclosure at the weekend in Ibadan South West local government area. He explained that the APC presented the best candidates for the 2023 general elections, an indication that the party would beat all other political parties in the elections. He advised the people of the local government area not to be deceived by politicians who will not remember them after the elections. “Vote for APC candidates. The APC selected the best candidates for the 2023 elections. We have different types of politicians. My candidature was miraculous. If not for God and some of our elders, I will not be the candidate. God made it possible. “I want to beg you, vote for APC from top to bottom if we want to enjoy dividends of democracy from the local, state and federal levels. “If we see any political party that has the best candidates as we have in APC, let them come out and say it. In terms of pedigree, experience, traditional hierarchy or acceptability, the APC has the best candidates. I want to advise you all that do not allow any political party to come and deceive you.
