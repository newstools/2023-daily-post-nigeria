The remains of elder statesman and former Minister of Aviation in the First Republic, Chief Mbazulike Amechi were yesterday in Ukpor, Nnewi South Local Government Area of Anambra State, committed to the earth. Amechi, a foremost statesman, nationalist, pre-independence activist and one of Nigeria’s founding fathers, died at the age of 94. His burial ceremony was attended by several dignitaries from the South East and beyond, including Anambra State governor, Prof Chukwuma Soludo and governors of the region, some of whom were represented. The dignitaries paid glowing tribute to him, with Soludo describing his passing as the end of an era. Speaking during the funeral mass, which was celebrated by the Catholic Bishop of Nnewi Diocese, Most Rev Jonas Benson Okoye, Soludo acknowledged Amechi’s commitment to Igbo culture. “The resurgence of idolatry which we see today is not the same as Igbo culture. Our young people should not accept that practice, which is fast gaining ground today. Our father here was a promoter of Igbo culture, and he was a strong Christian, and he died a Christian. “I pray for the peaceful repose of the soul of Chief Amechi. May he rest peacefully in the bosom of the Lord,” Governor Soludo prayed. Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige represented President Muhammadu Buhari during the event. Other dignitaries who attended include the Governor of Ebonyi State who was represented by his deputy, Dr Eric Kelechi Igwe, former Anambra deputy governor, Dame Virgy Etiaba and His Eminence, Francis Cardinal Arinze, among others. Earlier during the homily, Bishop Okoye said God chose to call Amechi home at such a special All Saints Day, a divine indication of his eternal citizenship of Heaven.
