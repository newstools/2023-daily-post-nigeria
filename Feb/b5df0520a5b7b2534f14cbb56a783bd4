The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Mr. Peter Obi says most of the politicians seeking to lead Nigeria are part of “the rejected establishment”. In an article published on Wednesday by a British newspaper, The Economist, Obi stated that he represents the majority of the people who desire a better country. The former Anambra governor said insecurity, terrorism, breakdown in education and health sectors, crumbling economy, crude oil theft, and others have motivated citizens to demand better leaders. Obi recalled militia attacks, abductions and extrajudicial killings that shook the nation in recent years while security agencies “appeared hapless”. He reminded the public that universities were shut for eight months in 2022 during the face-off between the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, and the federal government over decades-old unmet promises. The flagbearer lamented how the country’s crude-oil revenue plummeted from a steady average of $3billion a month in 2014 to nothing last year as oil theft rose dramatically. Stressing the relationship between the state of the nation and the quality of its leadership, Obi reiterated his hope in Nigeria’s potential to become a world power with good governance and utilisation of manpower. Obi said Nigeria itself needs to learn from the passion and dedication of its young people in the streets who are tired of the status quo in leadership and are taking their country back. “The prevailing sentiment across all demographics is that the Nigerian government is not for the people. Yet most of the politicians clamouring to take the helm this year are key players in this rejected establishment,” he said. The former bank chief also expressed his admiration for the youths who have “taken the mantle and led the charge for enthroning a reliable government” in the world’s most populous black nation.
