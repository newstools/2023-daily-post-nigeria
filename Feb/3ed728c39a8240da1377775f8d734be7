Famous Nigerian singer and Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, candidate for House of Representatives, Eti-Osa Federal Constituency of Lagos State, Olubankole Wellington, aka Banky W, said he is optimistic about winning the election this time. Speaking in an interview in Lagos on Saturday during elections, Banky stated: “At the end of the day, for me, it is all about the grace of God and the will of Lagos people. And I believe we have those two things. So, I’m confident that I will win this time.’’ Expressing his satisfaction at the turnout of voters and their conduct, Banky W said voters were well organised for the election process as many arrived as early as 7 am. “We have learnt many lessons from the previous elections, so we started our queue control a lot earlier. A few friends and I got here together and got canopies and chairs because that was the biggest polling unit in Eti-Osa,” he stated. The singer, in 2019, lost the Eti Osa Federal Constituency election to the All Progressives Congress, APC, candidate, Babajide Obanikoro.
