The Delta South Senatorial Candidate of the New Nigerian Peoples Party, NNPP, Omatseye Nesiama has warned that worse things than the hike in petrol and the scarcity of the new naira notes will happen in Nigeria if the people refuse to vote against bad politicians in the 2023 elections. Nesiama made the assertion during a town hall meeting in Ward 9, Warri, Delta State. He noted that the hike in petrol and scarcity of the new naira note is biting harder on citizens of the country. Nesiama said, “I thank God it’s happening like this. Our refusal to take action on the 25th of February, worse things will happen. I am not trying to be pessimistic.” He alleged that politicians are trying to pack money to rig the forthcoming election and advised the electorate to resist. ”If politicians give you money, collect and vote against them.”
