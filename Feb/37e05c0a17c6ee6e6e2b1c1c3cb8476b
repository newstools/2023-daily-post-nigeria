Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar, has demanded immediate upload of Saturday’s presidential election results on the server of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC. Abubakar made the call in a statement by his Media Adviser, Paul Ibe on Sunday in Abuja. He advised INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, to instruct the election collation officers to upload the results from the polling units to the INEC server immediately. Abubakar said the call became necessary to checkmate some governors trying to compromise the results at the local government collation level. “It will be a disservice to Nigerians and a negation to democracy for anyone to subvert the will of the people as freely expressed in their votes of yesterday,” Abubakar said. He called on Nigerians to be calm but vigilant to ensure that anti-democratic elements who were masquerading as progressives do not steal their mandate. Abubakar expressed gratitude to the Nigerian people for their support so far and pledged to continue to work hard to earn their trust and confidence.
