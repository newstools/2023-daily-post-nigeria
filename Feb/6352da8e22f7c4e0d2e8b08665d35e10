An All Progressives Congress, APC, chieftain, Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has urged Nigerians to elect the next President based on track records, warning them to ignore the foul-mouthed tribal and ethnic bigots trying to influence their choice. He also said Nigeria must return to the era when voters saw themselves as beautiful brides to be wooed by politicians and not as objects of trade on election day. Olawepo-Hashim said these in a chat with newsmen in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, on Monday. He lamented that party organisations must revolve around the people and not little emperors in different states. On the electorates, he said, “They must be sufficiently enlightened to see themselves as beautiful brides, and not as commodities of trade on the day of election. “Like in the first and second Republic, the voters must be confident enough to reject the deceit of political, ethnic and religious bigots who parade the political landscapes with foul language and filthy lucre.” He also stated that the party system, where principle and ideology reign, must be restored.
