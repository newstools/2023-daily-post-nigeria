The gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Ebonyi State, Ifeanyi Chukwuma Odii on Saturday, commiserated with the All Progressives Congress, APC, and its gubernatorial candidate, Francis Nwifuru, over the ghastly accident that took place in the state. Odii made this known in a statement signed by the partyâ€™s Media and Publicity Campaign Deputy Director, Moses Idika. He described the accident as unfortunate and applauded God for sparing the lives of the victims. He also commiserated with those who may have been injured in the accident that occurred along the Abakaliki, Afikpo Federal Highway, which the Speaker escaped unhurt. Odii further urged all Ebonyians, especially candidates of various political parties to imbibe the spirit of decorum and decency while going about their campaigns. He stated that it is only God that gives power, and that his political party believed in peace and unity, noting that no ambition is worth the life of any Ebonyian.
