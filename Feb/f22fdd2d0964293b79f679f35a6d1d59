Less than five weeks to the governorship election in Nigeria, the All Progressives Congress, APC, Akwa Ibom State has inaugurated its governorship campaign council christened Akan Udofia/Victor Antai Governorship Campaign Council. This is coming after a long legal battle with Senator Ita Enang, one of the governorship aspirants who dragged the party’s candidate to court challenging his membership of the party. In a statement signed by the Director, Electronic and Print Media of the Campaign Council, Anietie Ekong, the governorship candidate, Akanimo Udofia admitted that the journey ahead of them would not be easy but expressed hope that with members’ dedication and hard-work, the party would succeed. He also dismissed the allegation by the Akwa Ibom State government that the APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu insulted the people of the State. He said Tinubu meant well for Akwa Ibom people as he promised to deliver a deep sea port to the State that would turn around the fortunes of the people. Also speaking, the State Chairman of the APC, Obong Steve Ntokekpo urged the people not to be intimidated by anybody as the party is in charge of the Federal Government and would do everything to protect her members. The Director-General of the Campaign Council and a former Commissioner for Works in the State, Mr Don Etim, who responded on behalf of members of the Campaign Council, charged the members to be proud of their candidate as he remained untainted of any scandal nor would he be anybody’s stooge.
