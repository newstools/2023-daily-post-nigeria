Egypt head coach, Mahmoud Gaber is looking forward to his side’s Group A clash against the Flying Eagles of Nigeria at the ongoing 2023 Africa U-20 Cup of Nations. The Young Pharaohs were held to a 0-0 draw in the opening match on Sunday. The Flying Eagles on the other hand fell to a disappointing 1-0 loss to the Cubs of Senegal in their first game. Gaber’s side will be backed by vociferous fans inside the Cairo International Stadium. The former Ismaili gaffer said his team is well motivated to beat Ladan Bosso’s side. “We started working right after the Mozambique game,” Gaber was quoted by CAFonline. “Everyone is ready and we’re very motivated to win.” Senegal and Mozambique will clash in the other Group B game.
