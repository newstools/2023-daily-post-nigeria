Labour Party, LP, governorship candidate in Lagos State, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour has condemned “the massive violence” unleashed on the party’s supporters on Saturday. The flagbearer pointed out the attacks in different locations in the state, especially polling units where Peter Obi was in the lead. Gbadebo alleged that the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, orchestrated the violence to suppress LP votes in the presidential and national assembly poll. GRV, as fondly called, decried thugs’ invasions in Ikate Elegushi, Sangotedo, Aguda, Surulere, Oshodi and Osolo. DAILY POST reported the violence in Oniru and Ebute Metta, while residents also alerted of violence in Itire, Badagry, among others. “This is sad for democracy. Ballot boxes were snatched, voters threatened and beaten,” Gbadebo lamented. “We saw the video where a thug was asking those not voting for APC in Surulere to leave the queue if they don’t want to be beaten.” He, however, expressed satisfaction with the performance of LP in many units, urging the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to upload results on its portal as promised. The flagbearer further commended Lagosians for their “determination and doggedness to withstand the intimidation”.
