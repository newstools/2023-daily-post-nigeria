The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has reminded the Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero, that his late father, Alhaji Ado Bayero, had told them while on a visit to the Palace that he (Atiku) would be president. “We were on a courtesy call to the palace sometime while I was the Vice President of Nigeria, then late Emir Ado Bayero said he saw among us somebody who was going to be President and who would bring greatness to Nigeria,” Atiku said. Atiku Abubakar added that the late Emir Ado Bayero didn’t stop at that. He also went ahead to pray that the President he saw would bring sanity to Nigeria and improve its socio-economic standard. He said he believes he is the person mentioned by the late Emir Ado Bayero which is why it became imperative for the sitting Emir Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero to follow suit and pray for him to achieve the dreams of the late Bayero. Atiku Abubakar, who is in Kano on his presidential campaign, was at the Emir’s palace on a courtesy call, with his entourage, including his vice presidential candidate Ifeanyi Okowa.
