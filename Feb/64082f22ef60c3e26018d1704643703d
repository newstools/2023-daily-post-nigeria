The Nigerian Police Force has launched a manhunt to arrest and prosecute people abusing or selling the new naira notes. This was contained in a press statement issued by the Police Public Relations Officer of the Jigawa State Police Command, DSP Lawan Shiisu Adam. He said the state Commissioner of Police, Ekot Effiom, issued the warning following a meeting with commercial bank managers in Dutse, the state capital. According to him: “The directives comply with those of the Inspector General of Police Usman Alkali Baba on the Federal Government’s policy and drive to uphold the provisions of the Central Bank of Nigeria Act, 2007, and dignify Nigeria’s currency.” The Commissioner of Police had charged police officers to arrest anybody found hawking, selling, spraying, or stamping on the naira notes. He urged Jigawa’s law-abiding citizens to report any dishonest individuals to the nearest police station or office of any sister security organisation for immediate intervention.
