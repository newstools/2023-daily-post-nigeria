The governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi has, a few hours before the presidential election, vowed to ensure that free, fair and credible elections are held in the 13 local government areas of the state. Umahi equally directed security agencies in the state to arrest and prosecute any miscreant caught with firearm on election day. Umahi made this known while speaking with newsmen in Abakaliki, shortly after a security meeting in his office at the new Government House, Centenary City, Abakaliki, capital of Ebonyi State. The governor promised to ensure adequate security for the citizens to exercise their franchise, without molestation and intimidation. He further told the people of the state: “We also got a surprise package from security chiefs from Abuja, all geared towards having a free and fair election. Ladies and gentlemen, let me inform you we have flying officers from the Nigerian Airforce, Enugu. They would be flying low to maintain law and order, so you should not entertain any fears.” The governor further assured that he has put in place measures to ensure hitch-free elections in the state. “The efforts are to instil confidence in the voters, as the deployment of electoral materials and personnel have been concluded to ensure free and fair elections,” he added. Gov Umahi also directed security agencies to ensure that movement across polling units during elections is prohibited within the state. “We have also agreed that anybody seen with gun that shouldn’t have gun or trying to disrupt the election processes should be immediately arrested and taken away. “I have instructed all my party people including those of other parties not to violate electoral laws, anyone doing so must be arrested,” he stated.
