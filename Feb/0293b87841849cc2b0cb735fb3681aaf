Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara State has put on hold his campaign rallies for his second-term ambition until further notice. This followed violent protests which rocked Ilorin the state capital on Wednesday as a result of residents’ frustration over the naira swap policy. Five suspects were arrested by police in connection with the disturbances which spread across the state capital. In a special broadcast to the people of the state at 5 pm in Ilorin, the capital of the state, on Wednesday, Governor Abdulrazaq, expressed sincere sympathy with the citizens on the continuous scarcity of the naira as a result of the recent CBN’s currency redesign. He said: “for clarity, the Supreme Court has granted an injunction that allows the old and the new notes to coexist. This injunction is still valid until the highest court rules otherwise. I, therefore, want all of you to be calm, law-abiding, and peaceful. Let us not attack one another or destroy one another’s properties.” He appealed to the citizens to remain calm and peaceful, and not give in to any frustrations or engage in any form of violence. Governor Abdulrazaq testified to the inconvenience the development has brought on the populace and asserted: “We are in this together, and I assure you that this will be over in the shortest possible time. I really appreciate your patience.” He then declared: “In solidarity with the mood of the public, I’m putting my public rallies on hold until further notice.”
