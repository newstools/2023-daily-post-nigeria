Governor Darius Dickson Ishaku of Taraba State has condemned the gruesome killings of the two wives and five children of Suleiman Mohammed, the traditional ruler of Mutum-Biyu, in the Gassol Local Government Area of the state. The monarch’s family, who were recently abducted in Jalingo, the state capital, were brutally murdered by the suspected kidnappers. Their decomposing remains were found in a forest. The police are yet to make any arrests in connection to the crime. Shocked by the incident, the state governor, through his Commissioner of Information and Reorientation, Lois Emmanuel, described the act as “barbaric,ungodly, inhuman and uncivilized.” Ishaku, who spoke through a press statement issued to newsmen on Saturday, in Jalingo, regretted that the state government’s sustained efforts to rid the state of kidnappings and other forms of banditry were being thwarted by the recent developments. He vowed not to relent in his determination to keep citizens safe. He also vowed to network with the various security agencies in the state to bring to book the perpetrators of the dastardly act. Ishaku urged security operatives to work round the clock in fishing out both the sponsors and the perpetrators of the crime.
