Anambra State Governor, Prof Chukwuma Soludo has said that he is committed to ensuring the release of the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mr Nnamdi Kanu. Soludo spoke on Monday in a quarterly statewide briefing, meant to intimate Anambra people of his activities in government. He said he had booked a session with the president of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari, and was only waiting for appointment, where he hopes to discuss the issue of security in the South East, and the release of Kanu. Recall that during the flag off of the APGA campaigns in Awka, Soludo had called on the federal government to release Kanu. He pledged to stand as surety for Kanu, if the federal government found it hard to release him unconditionally. In reply to Soludo’s request, the Attorney general and minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami had said that Soludo only made a statement, but has not applied to the court, or to his office about Kanu’s release. But speaking during the quarterly briefing, Soludo said he hope to meet President Buhari, and also speak with him on the imperative of releasing Kanu. He said releasing Kanu would help him (Kanu) to intervene in areas where people use secessionist agitation as a means to perpetuate criminality. He said: “On the issue of Nnamdi Kanu, his release does not mean that insecurity will be completely eliminated. The call is in the best interest of the South East as a whole. “He (Kanu) was saddened by the level of crime associated with the agitation when I visited him in prison. He called it an abomination. “Everyone has now become freedom fighter, using it as an avenue to commit crime. The truth is that if he is released, he will be able to distinguish between genuine freedom fighters and criminals. “What is still holding him back is a political issue. I am awaiting confirmation of appointment with the President to hand him the letter officially.”
