A group operating under the aegis of The Compatriots on Friday called on the Federal Government and the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to allow elections hold simultaneously on the same day. The socio-political group believes that the option would save the nation from the existential threat to lives and properties in the country. A statement issued on Friday by the Chairman of the group and former Governor of Akwa-Ibom State, Obong Victor Attah, which he sent to DAILY POST in Abuja, cautioned Nigerians against provocative utterances and urged citizens to be committed to ensuring a peaceful atmosphere in the few days before the election. “We strongly believe that there is merit in considering the option of holding all the elections in one day. “While acknowledging that this will pose some challenges to the management of the elections, we consider it a safer option in the light of potential consequential threats to security,” the statement reads. The group further expressed worries about the preparation and timelines of the elections, adding that challenges threatening the smooth conduct of elections must be promptly handled. They insisted that the elections must be held against all odds in a fair and credible manner. According to the group: “All actual and perceived threats to the elections must therefore be handled promptly and decisively. Current difficulties facing citizens represent threats to the elections. “Rhetoric and statements which inflame passions should be avoided by all. In particular, comments that suggest that the democratic elections must end with their candidate’s victory should be condemned.”
