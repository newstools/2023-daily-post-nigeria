Arsenal legend, Paul Merson, has predicted the scoreline of Manchester United’s Carabao Cup [EFL Cup] final tie against Newcastle United on Sunday. Man United and Newcastle will face each other in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday evening at Wembley Stadium. Providing his prediction, Merson backed Man United to beat Newcastle 2-1. Merson was quoted by Sportskeeda as saying: “United are the team to beat in the final. Newcastle United are not a free-scoring side. They don’t blow teams away. “For me, the Magpies are desperate to win a trophy (more than getting into the top four) and these players can attain legendary status if they win silverware. Unfortunately, it looks unlikely that will happen. Manchester United 2-1 Newcastle United.”
