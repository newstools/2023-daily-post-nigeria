Senator Smart Adeyemi has lashed at the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Governor, Godwin Emefiele, saying the Naira redesign was meant to inflict hardship on innocent citizens. The lawmaker, who represents Kogi West Senatorial District, described the cashless policy as heartless, in view of hardship being encountered without an end in sight. Speaking at a press conference in Abuja on Saturday, Adeyemi alleged that the apex bank governor was acting the script of some cabals in the presidency to make the All Progressives Congress, APC, lose the election later this month. According to him, the policy was to ensure that the APC does not win the election as the cashless policy was vitiating the electoral chances of the APC as citizens were lamenting for lack of cash to meet their daily needs. Adeyemi said poor people currently experiencing hardship are cursing the Central Bank governor while he called on President Muhammadu Buhari for his intervention. “I am in support of the need to change the currency, but I am not in support of the way and manner the whole process is being done. “Many died because they had no cash to buy drugs, and some died because of high blood pressure. The big men have cash in their houses. President Buhari’s seven-day is too long to effect a change,” he said. He insisted that suffering has become unbearable now before it gets too late, even as he said, as an “elected Senator, people have been asking, how will they pay money to get money? “Artisans are dying on a daily basis,” Adeyemi said.
