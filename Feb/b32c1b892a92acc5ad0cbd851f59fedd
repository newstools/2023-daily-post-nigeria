Former Shakhtar Donetsk boss Andreas Carrasco has told Mykhailo Mudryk that the Ukrainian winger should have joined Arsenal instead of Chelsea. Mudryk joined the Blues during this transfer window and made a memorable first impression in his first appearance for Graham Potter’s side. The winger’s display for the few minutes he spent on the pitch, looking dangerous and causing problems for Liverpool’s experienced James Milner. Chelsea hijacked Arsenal’s move for Mudryk, paying £89 million for the 21-year-old. But Carrasco is not too pleased with the 22-year-old moving to Chelsea, and he told UA Tribuna. “It would be better for him, in my opinion [to have joined Arsenal]. “Mudryk is arguably the most talented (Ukrainian) player at the moment. And he is very different from everyone.”
