Premier League legend, Alan Shearer has said that Arsenal striker, Eddie Nketiah ‘won’t sleep tonight’ after failing to score some clear chances during the Gunners 3-1 defeat to Manchester City on Wednesday night. Arsenal were defeated for the first time at the Emirates Stadium this season, with goals from Kevin de Bruyne, Jack Graelish and Erling Haaland for the visitors. Bukayor Saka scored Arsenal’s only goal of the night from the spot kick. The win over Arsenal put Manchester City on top of the table on goal difference. Nketiah had a golden opportunity to give the hosts the lead, picked out by Oleksandr Zinchenko’s superb cross from the left only to head wide. In the 89th minute, the 23-year-old headed wide again to miss another good opportunity that would have given Arsenal a fighting chance heading into injury time. Shearer told Amazon Prime: “He won’t sleep tonight. But you have always got the chance to rectify your mistake and in three days’ time he will hopefully put it in the back of the net and he won’t remember this.” Arsenal have now dropped seven points from their last three games, a 1-0 defeat to Everton, 1-1 draw with Brentford and a 3-1 loss to defending champions, Man City. Manchester City sit top of the table on goals difference, though Mikel Arteta’s side still have a game in hand. After their defeat to Manchester City last night, Arteta said he still believes his side will go on to win the 2022-23 Premier League season.
