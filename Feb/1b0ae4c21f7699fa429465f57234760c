Manchester United midfielder, Casemiro is set to serve a three-match suspension after he was shown a straight red card against Crystal Palace on Saturday. Casemiro was sent off after a VAR check showed he appeared to choke Will Hughes following a scuffle. If United appeal and lose it, there is a chance the FA could increase it to four games. The Premier League rule stated that “a straight red card can be overturned if an appeal is lodged. “In the event of a successful appeal, the suspension will be cancelled. But if the FA rules a club has lodged a ‘frivolous’ appeal, a three-game ban can be increased to four.” As it stands, Casemiro will sit out two league fixtures against Leeds United and a home game against Leicester City. He will however be back for the Carabao Cup final against Newcastle United.
