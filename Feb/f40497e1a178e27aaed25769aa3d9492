Different organisations in Taraba State are working towards ensuring a hitch-free general election. The latest of such moves was the plans mapped out by Rev Matthew Kukah Centre and Taraba-based Independent Peace Committee. At the time of filing this report, the two organisations have concluded plans to make all the governorship candidates in the state sign a peace accord before going into the elections. A statement on Sunday made available to journalists in Jalingo, the state capital, by the secretary of the Independent Peace Committee, Justine Tyopuusu, stated that the signing of the peace accord, slated for tomorrow, would provide opportunities for all the governorship candidates in the state to engage themselves in a roundtable dialogue. The plans, according to the organisers, will enable all the candidates “to commit themselves to peace before, during and after the elections.” Elated by the move, chieftains of the various political parties who barred their minds to DAILY POST correspondent believed that the accord, if eventually signed by the candidates of all the political parties, would go a long way in discouraging any form of election violence. While applauding the move, they also urged the organisers to leave no stone unturned in ensuring that all the governorship candidates are physically present at the event. At the time of filing this report, it is not clear whether the governorship candidates in the state will make themselves available for the exercise following the internal wrangling in some of the political parties.
