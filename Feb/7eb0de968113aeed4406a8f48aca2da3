The Coalition of South East Youth Leaders, COSEYL, has called on the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, to ensure the availability of the new redesigned Naira notes across the country to ease businesses. Our correspondent reports that several businesses, particularly in the rural areas, crumbled a few days ago following the scarcity of the new Naira notes. Despite the extension of the deadline for the old notes, cash is still a big issue as both the old and the new notes are unavailable. Reacting, COSEYL in a statement issued on Tuesday by its President-General, Goodluck Ibem, urged the apex bank to allow the notes to circulate across the nation during the 10 days grace period. “The CBN should during the above 10 days period ensure that the new naira notes are released into circulation to enable Nigerians to have access to it for their day to day business activities. “The non-availability of the new notes in circulation have made so many businesses to close down in the last few days”, the statement added.
