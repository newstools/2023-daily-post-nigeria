Voters in Dutse Makaranta, Bwari Local Government Area in the Federal Capital Territory, have called out the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, over alleged poor conduct of the polls. DAILY POST reports that Polling Units in Dutse Makaranta Primary Health Centre had commenced accreditation and voting around 12:15pm, however, some voters have expressed anger over the conduct of the process. An electorate, Emeka Ugwu said the process is poorly organized, however, he is determined to wait. “The situation is not well organized. I have been moving from one Polling Unit to another. I cannot find my name. However, because we are patient Nigerians, we are patiently waiting. I even had to discuss with some women already tired of waiting”. Christian Okpate said the voting and accreditation are ongoing, however, the voters would be happier with the conduct of INEC officials. “I have been here for hours, and the queue is not moving because of the crowd. It is frustrating; some voters are already tired and planning to leave the centre”. DAILY POST observed that the situation is the same at Dutse Makaranta Primary School.
