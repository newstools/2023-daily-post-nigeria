Governor of Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State on Monday disclosed that the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu remains the best person to lead the country for the next four years. According to the governor, Tinubu’s prowess cannot be matched with the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar and that of Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi. While meeting with stakeholders in Owo, Akeredolu, urged the people to vote massively for Tinubu on Saturday. He equally appealed to the people to vote for the candidates vying for the senatorial and House of Representatives seats under the APC in the state. “If you look at the political workings of this country, you will realise that the choice of Tinubu is not something you can fault. He has a track record of achievement. “Among those who are running, his achievements tower above them. We are supporting him not because we are from the same tribe but because he’s competent.”
