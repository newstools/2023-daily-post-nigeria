Manchester United legend, Wayne Rooney, has refused to rule out the possibility of the Red Devils winning the Premier League this season ahead of Arsenal and Manchester City. Rooney also hailed manager Erik ten Hag’s impact at Manchester United so far this season. Man United are currently in the third position on the Premier League table with three points behind Man City and five behind leaders Arsenal. “He [Ten Hag] is exactly what Manchester United have needed for a few years now,” Rooney told ESPN. “I have been down to the training ground quite a few times, especially in the [MLS] off-season when I was back home in England and spoke to quite a few of the players. “I know the players are enjoying working under him [Ten Hag], which is always important, but he demands a lot of his players. “I think he has changed the mindset and the confidence and belief of the players, that they are actually a good team, and I think people are starting to see that this season and they are in a good position. “They are five points off the top spot, you know there [are] still a lot of games to go. So you never know.”
