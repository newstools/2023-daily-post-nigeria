Famous Nigerian singer, Folarin Falana, better known as Falz, the bad guy, has questioned the political structure claimed by the All Progressives Congress, APC, as he recounted an attack by political thugs. Recall that during the 2023 presidential election on Saturday, the singer was attacked with his phone stolen by alleged APC political thugs at his polling unit in Lekki, Lagos State. In a viral social media video, Folarin explained that ”the thugs came at about 11:50 am and began snatching phones and beating people. They destroyed a couple of ballot boxes before the military eventually arrived. My phone recovered. Thank you all for the calls.” Speaking further, he said, “I have a question. Shebi, they said ‘structure, structure, structure’. They have all the structure in the world regarding political stuff. What then happened? Why then did you send your thugs?” ”Despite the violence, Labour Party won the presidential votes with 108 votes, APC got 31, and PDP got 2 in my polling unit,” he stated
