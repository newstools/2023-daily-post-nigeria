Liverpool legend Michael Owen has rated Manchester United’s chances of winning the Premier League this season. According to the Englishman, at this point, it would be foolish not to view the Red Devils as title contenders. He said this after Erik ten Hag’s side beat Leeds United 2-0 at Elland Road on Sunday with second-half goals from Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho. Man United dropped two points at Old Trafford to Leeds on Wednesday but bounced back to win the reverse fixture. The win sees United five points behind league leaders Arsenal and Owen believed his former Club can still win the league. Speaking on Premier League Productions, the former England striker was asked if United are title challengers this season, and he said “Absolutely.” He said: “If Man City and Arsenal were playing like they were a few months ago, then I would say it’s between those two. But both of them are stumbling. “Arsenal, one point from six. Man City, I can’t see them going on an amazing run like they have the last few years. “You have to include Manchester United, they’re second in the league! If you include Man City you’ve got to include United. There’s a lot of football to be played.”
