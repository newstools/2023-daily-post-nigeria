The compound heads who spoke after their meeting which had in attendance of over 30 compound heads have however declared that they are not politicians, hence they cannot anoint or endorse any of the candidates. Spokesperson for the compound heads, Mogaji Muktar Adewale Gbadeyanka who is the Mogaji of Adeyipo compound in Ibadan, noted that the compound heads have the right to bless all the candidates but cannot in any way anoint or endorse anyone for political positions. Gbadeyanka while addressing the journalists on behalf of his colleagues explained that it is not in the custom or tradition of Ibadan chiefs to anoint or endorse any candidate for political positions. He added that the only thing they can do is to bless all the candidates which they have done. He said that the Mogajis are not in support or against any of the candidates because all of them (candidates) have come to them to seek their blessing. Gbadeyanka said, “Today, Tuesday, 14th February, we had a meeting which was attended by over 30 Mogajis. We learnt that some compound heads have endorsed a candidate. “We want to tell you that Ibadan Mogajis did not endorse or anoint any candidate. We did not endorse anyone. “We are not politicians. We have blessed all the candidates. We did not support any candidate. “Ibadan chiefs do not support or endorse any candidate. All the candidates have come to us and we have blessed them. We do not anoint any candidate. We are not against or support any candidate.”
