Former Arsenal defender, William Gallas, has admitted that he is worried that the Gunners will slip into a ‘negative spiral’ if they lose against Manchester City when both teams clash in a Premier League title showdown on Wednesday. Arsenal will host Man City in a Premier League tie at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday evening. The Gunners are currently on top of the Premier League table with 3 points ahead of Pep Guardiola’s side. “I am worried about this game for Arsenal, to be honest,” Gallas told Genting Casino. “Arsenal has had some bad results recently and Man City are starting to look better. “City beat Aston Villa and will travel to the Emirates with Arsenal, not in great shape. “Psychologically, maybe Arsenal are also a little bit down after and City will believe that they can get a result on Wednesday. They’ll believe that they can go back to Manchester with three points. “The only thing I can say to Arsenal is don’t lose. It does not matter if you draw and, of course, a victory would be the best possible result, but they absolutely must not lose the game.” Arsenal heads to the game after playing a 1-1 draw with Brentford in their last game. Man City, on the other hand, defeated Aston Villa 3-1 in their last Premier League tie.
