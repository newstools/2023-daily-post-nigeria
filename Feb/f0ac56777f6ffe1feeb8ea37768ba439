Newcastle United legend, Alan Shearer has described the red card given to Manchester United midfielder, Casemiro during the Red Devil’s 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday as very harsh. The Premier League legend pointed out that a different camera angle, which was not used by the video assistant referee, showed that the Brazilian did not commit any offence. Manchester United were 2-1 winners over Palace at Old Trafford on Saturday but had their engine room Casemiro sent off and suspended for three matches. A rough challenge from Jeffrey Schlupp on Antony sparked a melee between both sets of players and the Brazil international was singled out by the VAR for having grabbed Will Hughes around the neck. “There’s a melee in the corner…”, said Shearer on Match of the Day. Shearer went on to explain that apart from the angle that the video assistant referee showed the referee, there is another angle from behind Casemiro which shows something different. “But there’s another angle where it doesn’t look anywhere near as bad. “And this angle from behind Hughes, you can see it there closely, he’s got hold of him, yes, but by the shirt rather than around the neck,” he said. The former England striker said that it appeared Casemiro was not just lucky because there was a lot more going on at that point, notably “Ayew on Fred and what have you. “You can see there are slaps and pushing and grabbing and everything else.”
