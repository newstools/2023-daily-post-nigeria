As Nigerians elect a new president today, no fewer than two million Ogun State residents are expected to take part in the election. Aside from electing President Muhammadu Buhariâ€™s successor, the voters will also elect new senators and House of Assembly members. The Ogun State Resident Electoral Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Niyi Ijalaye, said there are 2,688,305 registered voters in Ogun State. Of this figure, 2,276,209 voters have collected their permanent voter cards (PVC) to vote in the elections, INEC said. Today, it is yet to be seen if the election will receive a massive turnout of voters commensurate with the total number of PVCs collected.
