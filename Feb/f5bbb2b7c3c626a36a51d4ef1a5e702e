The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has alleged that the move by the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, to redesign Naira notes was aimed at causing riots in the country. Wike, who spoke on Saturday during a campaign in the Opobo/Nkoro Local Government Area of the state, alleged that the aim was to cause crises which would lead to the postponement of the February and March elections. The governor alleged that there were plots by some persons in power to scuttle the election and introduce an interim government. He urged Nigerians to remain calm despite the hardship emanating from scarcity of the newly redesigned Naira notes, insisting that the election must not be shifted. He said, “This policy (naira redesign) is targeted at making people angry so that they will demonstrate and riot and then the election be postponed. Then, they will introduce an interim government. “No matter the provocation, don’t protest,” Wike cautioned the people of the state. “This election will hold. This election is by the PVCs. This election is not an election of cabals; it is an election of Nigerians.”
