Manchester United midfielder, Bruno Fernandes has revealed the strict rules manager Erik ten Hag imposed on players like Cristiano Ronaldo, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford. Ten Hag set about imposing himself at Old Trafford after he arrived from Ajax. The Dutchman reportedly made it clear the players must follow a strict dress code and they must ensure they eat at a certain time at Carrington canteen as well as follow a ban on mobile phone usage while on away trips. He quickly fell out with Cristiano Ronaldo, who he punished for storming out of a home game against Tottenham Hotspur before full-time. The Portugal captain left the club by mutual consent in November. Jadon Sancho was also exiled from the squad, while Rashford was dropped for an away game at Wolves. Fernandes told BT Sport: “He [ten Hag] first arrived and we went on tour and the training sessions we had, he demands: you do it or you’re out. You don’t play. Everyone was a little bit like in the beginning: ‘Will he do that or not? If a big player doesn’t do what he wants will he pull him apart or not?’ “And he did that many times, he did it with Cristiano, with Jadon, with Marcus.”
