A member of the National Youth Service Corps, NYSC, was mobbed in Abuja on Saturday for alleged electoral malpractice. The incident occurred at the polling unit inside LEA Primary School in the Lugbe area of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT. In a video, eyewitnesses said he was caught allegedly thumb printing ballot papers in favour of a political party. The corps member was attacked by dozens of youths who challenged him for engaging in such misconduct. “They should not kill him. Please…please,” a woman begged profusely. DAILY POST gathered that the intervention of some residents and security operatives saved the young man from being lynched.
