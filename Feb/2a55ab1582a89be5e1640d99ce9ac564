Bendel Insurance failed to record a win in the Nigeria Premier Football League for the first time this season after they were held to a 0-0 draw by Gombe United at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, Benin City. Gombe United, who only recorded their first win of the campaign in midweek against Shooting Stars, put up a strong defensive performance in the game. The Savannah Scorpions were also the first team to stop Insurance from scoring in an NPFL game this season. Insurance extended their lead at the top of the log to 13 points ahead of the other Group A games on Sunday. In Uyo, Abia Warriors defeated Dakkada 4-2 to compound the woes of the home team, who are now battling to escape the drop. Emmanuel Onu capitalized on a loose ball to put Abia Warriors ahead on 27 minutes. The visitors doubled their advantage through John Peter three minutes after the break. Emmanuel Ayoasi got one back for the hosts on 65 minutes. Abia Warriors regained their two goal cushion 11 minutes from time when Felix Aniekwe fired home from outside the box. Aniekan Ekpe reduced the deficit for Dakkada in the 84th minute. Monday Yakubu made the points save for Abia Warriors by grabbing the fourth on the dot of 90 minutes.
