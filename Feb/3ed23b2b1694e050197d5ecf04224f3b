The police in Ogun State has said some individuals are planning to cause breach of public peace in the State by taking undue advantage of the lingering cash and fuel scarcity in the nation. The Ogun police command said it has intelligence report that those planning the mayhem may attack banks and other public and private infrastructures in the State. The Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Frank Mba, who commended the residents of the State for their resilience and peaceful conduct in the face of the biting economic challenges, assured residents of the command’s resolve to protect lives and property. In a statement, the police spokesman in Ogun, Abimbola Oyeyemi, revealed that the CP spoke at a confidence-building patrol conducted by the police and other security forces on Saturday. “The CP further noted that intelligence at the disposal of the Command indicates that some criminal elements are planning to take advantage of the challenging economic situation to disrupt the peace being enjoyed in the State,” Oyeyemi said. He said the CP warned that the police would not fold its arms and allow criminals to hide under any guise “to unleash mayhem on residents, private and public property, and critical national infrastructure, including banks and offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).” Mba had assured that necessary security architecture had been put in place to protect the people, adding that Area Commanders and Divisional Police Officers (DPOs), have been directed to arrest any person or group wanting to foment trouble and cause breach of peace in the State. The CP, who empathised with residents, urged parents, guardians and other stakeholders to prevail on their children, wards and followers to shun all acts of violence, saying all necessary actions are being taken to further ease the pains of the people in this regard.
