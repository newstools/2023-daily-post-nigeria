A cameraman with Trust TV, Taiwo Yishau was on Tuesday beaten at the venue of the All Progressives Congress, APC, grand finale rally for Bola Tinubu. He was attacked at one of the gates of Teslim Balogun Stadium despite displaying the press tag issued by the party. Yishau said he was stopped from gaining access despite explanation that he was duly assigned to cover the event. The journalist narrated how he was hit multiple times by a gang of hoodlums who accused him of forging the tag. This was after bouncers hired to man the gate handed him over to his attackers who insisted he was working for another party. “I showed them the press tag given to us by APC Publicity Secretary, Mr. Seye Oladejo yesterday. But they said it is fake. “They said I am working for the opposition. They asked me to show previous works I did for APC and they kept beating me,” he said. Yishau lamented that policemen a few meters away from the scene stood idly and watched “as if nothing is happening”. “They didn’t say anything. I was trying to protect my camera and the phone as they kept beating me”, he added. The management of Media Trust Group, owners of Daily Trust, has condemned the attack and vowed to take up the matter with appropriate authorities.
