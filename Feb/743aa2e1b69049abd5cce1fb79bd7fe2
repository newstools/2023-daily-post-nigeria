The Lagos State government has ordered the closure of Chrisland School in Opebi, Ikeja, after the death of a student, Whitney Adeniran. Commissioner for Education, Folasade Adefisayo on Sunday said the school would remain shut pending the outcome of a full inquiry. The official commiserated with the family and friends of the deceased and prayed for the repose of her soul. Adefisayo, however, called for calm, assuring that “no effort will be spared in investigating the incident”. The father of the late 12-year-old called for an investigation into her death in a statement circulated on social media. Michael Adeniran said she neither had any health condition nor was she sick when the school bus picked her up for inter-house sports activities last Thursday.
