The Big Brother Titans housemate, Nana, has disclosed the types of people she rolls with can be deadly. Nana made the revelation following a fight which started as a verbal exchange with Khosi on Monday. Speaking about the fight with her paired partner, Thabang, Nana said she knows deadly people that can deal with Khosi, and they are watching what’s happening on the show. Stating that she can trace anyone who dares her, no matter their hiding places. Recall that the fight, which caused all the housemates to interfere, started when Khosi played cards upstairs, and Thabang decided to talk to her. Nana, who already feels Thabang‘s closeness to Khosi is the reason they have been twice nominated for eviction in a row, joked about his movement. This was already not sitting well with Khosi, who rushed down to confront Nana.
