Suspected ritualists have killed a boy in the Adamawa State capital, Yola, and removed some parts of his body. The lifeless body of the boy was found in Rumde, a community behind Yola North Local Government Secretariat in Jimeta, with his throat sliced and his tongue and eye removed. The victim has been identified as a pupil of one of the Islamic schools in the locality. Some residents of Rumde have spoken of having heard the cry of the boy, but said they took no action because they thought it was merely molestation of a junior pupil by a senior. The State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Yahaya Nguroje said the corpse of the boy had been taken to hospital for autopsy and that investigation had commenced to track down the culprits. He urged parents and guardians to always take full responsibility for their childrenâ€™s upbringing. DAILY POST reports that the deceased, who is of the Tsangaya Islamiyya school, would most likely have been one of those brought into Yola from a distant town for Islamic and Arabic literacy.
