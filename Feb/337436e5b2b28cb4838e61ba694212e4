Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, won the presidential election held on Saturday in Ekiti State. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Tinubu polled a total of 201, 484 votes, to defeat Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who had 89, 554 and Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP) who polled 11, 397 votes across the 16 local government areas of the state. Prof. Akeem Lasisi, the Presidential Election Collation Officer for Ekiti, who announced the result at the INEC Headquarters in Ado-Ekiti, said that a total of 988, 923 voters registered in the state. Lasisi, who is the Vice Chancellor of the Federal University of Health Sciences, Ila Orangun, Osun State, said the total number of accredited voters was 315, 058 while the total number of vote cast was 314, 472. According to him, at the end of the exercise, the total number of valid votes cast was 308, 171 while 6,301 votes cast were invalid. Lasisi, who described the turnout of voters in the state as very encouraging and impressive, based his observation on the total number of votes cast by the electorate during the presidential election. “Yes, the turnout was very impressive as you can see from the number of people that came out to exercise their franchise,” he said. Meanwhile, Mr Odunayo Okunade, the agent of the Labour Party for the Presidential election, claimed that many of his party members were intimidated, and prevented from exercising their franchise during the poll. He also claimed that the names of the party’s candidates for the senatorial and House Representatives elections were omitted from the ballot papers. “We are going to sit down and study the results for our next line of action. Some of our members were physically intimidated, assaulted and in the process prevented from voting. Not only that, more compounding is the non-inclusion of our candidates’ names on the ballot papers for the Senatorial and House of Representatives elections,” he said. Reacting to the results, Mr Garuba Arogundade, the APC agent for the election, said: “The result scored by the party (APC) is a reflection of the fact that the party was and still is highly connected with the people of the state,”.
