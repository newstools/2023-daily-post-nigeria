The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) has allocated petrol to marketers directly to ease scarcity. The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) made the disclosure on Tuesday. The President, Chinedu Okoronkwo said the order was issued after a closed-door meeting of both parties. It was agreed that IPMAN members should load petrol at NIPCO, MRS and other assigned depots. The marketers were however encouraged to upgrade their POS to G4 or G5 for payment efficiency. “Members without POS are also advised to acquire it for efficiency,” Okoronkwo told NAN in Lagos. Okonkwo urged IPMAN divisions across the nation to open up their stations and start selling. Lawal Sade, NNPCL Managing Director; Adeyemi Adetunji, VP Downstream; IPMAN BoT Chair, Abdulkardir Aminu, and exco members attended the meeting.
