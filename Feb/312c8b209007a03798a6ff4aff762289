The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof Isa Pantami, has said that the average price of one-gigabyte data was reduced to N350 in October 2022 from N1200 in November 2019. The minister made this disclosure on Wednesday at the closing ceremony of the Maiden Digital Economic Regional Conference, DERC, held in Abuja. Pantami, speaking on the federal government’s achievement in broadband, said with the launch of Elon Musk’s Starlink, Nigeria now has 100 per cent penetration nationwide. He stated that other West African countries are eager to adopt the nation’s digital economy policy across the region. According to him, “If you look at the plan, the average price of one gigabyte data was N1,200 in November 2019, then we said by 2025 we are targeting to reduce it to N390 by the reduction in the cost of production. Today, based on the Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, report in October 2022, the average price of 1GB of data is now N350. Sometimes what we do in policy formulation is to under-promise and over-deliver.”
