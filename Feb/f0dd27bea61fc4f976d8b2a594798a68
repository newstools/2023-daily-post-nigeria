Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai, has claimed that one of his fellow governors withdrew N500m in new Naira notes from an undisclosed bank despite the inability of Nigerians to get the cash. This is coming amid the cash crunch across the country birthed by the scarcity of the redesigned Naira notes. El-Rufai who spoke in an exclusive interview with BBC Hausa alleged that the N500m was given to the governor by the bank. The Kaduna governor lamented that the 10-day extension given by the Central Bank of Nigeria for old notes to exit was not enough stressing that more time was needed. “Yesterday, I was told that one of our governors got N500m in new notes from the bank. It was the bank that gave him. “There is nowhere in the world that currency exchange doesn’t happen but they don’t give limited time such as this one for currency swap and definitely not close to elections”, he said.
