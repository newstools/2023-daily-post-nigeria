A Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos State, has remanded a Nollywood actress and skit maker Oluwadarasimi Omoseyin in Kirikiri correctional centre for tampering with the new Naira notes. The actress was remanded in prison till the determination of her bail application before the court. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, arraigned the actress on Monday on a two-count charge brought against her before Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke. One of the counts read: â€œthat you Oluwadarasimi Omoseyin, on the 28th of January 2023, at Monarch event centre, Lekki, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, whilst dancing during a social occasion tampered with the sum of N100, 000.00 issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, by spraying it at the occasion. You thereby committed offence contrary to and punishable under section 21 (1) of the Central Bank Act, 2007. She pleaded not guilty to the charge. The prosecution counsel, S.I Sulaiman asked for a trial date from the court and prayed that the defendant be remanded in prison custody. Counsel to the defendant, Goncalves Adenike, prayed the court to admit the defendant to bail till the hearing of the case, urging that she be remanded in EFCC custody till the perfection of her bail terms. The Judge deferred the ruling on the bail application to Wednesday, 15th of February, 2023, and remanded the defendant in prison. Recall that the actress was arrested by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Fraud Related Offences Commission, ICPC, on the 1st of February 2023, after a clip showing her spraying and stepping on the new Naira notes at a party went viral on social media. She was later handed over to the EFCC for investigation.
