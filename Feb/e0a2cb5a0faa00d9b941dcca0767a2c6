Manchester United legend, Patrice Evra, has revealed what he loves most about the club’s January signing, Marcel Sabitzer. Sabitzer joined Man United on loan from Bayern Munich for the remainder of the season. The 28-year-old is yet to make his debut for Erik ten Hag’s side. Speaking to Betfair, Evra said what he loves most about Sabitzer was that the midfielder scores goals from outside of the box. The Frenchman said, “Even if he has not played in a United shirt, Marcel Sabitzer’s work rate is quite impressive. “He’s got the stamina and what I love about this player, he scores goals from outside of the box.” “He scored some great goals for Leipzig, and of course, he’s had less playing time at Bayern Munich, and that is why we have got him, but I am sure Ten Hag will have studied the player, he will know the player and sometimes those players need to rebound.”
