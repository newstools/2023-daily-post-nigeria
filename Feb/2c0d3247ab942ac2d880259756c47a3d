Kano State House of Representatives Majority Leader, Alhassan Ado Doguwa, has been arrested by the Nigeria Police Force. Doguwa was arrested at the Aminu Kano International Airport while boarding a flight to Abuja over his alleged role in the killing of several persons and burning of the New Nigeria People’s Party, NNPP, secretariat during the just concluded presidential polls. Also, he was alleged to have used his orderly pistol and fired several persons. Doguwa, who reportedly led the thugs that set the NNPP secretariat on fire, where at least two persons were burnt to death, is currently cooling his heels in the state Criminal Investigation Department. Confirming the incident, the state police stated that no fewer than three persons were killed when the campaign secretariat of the NNPP located in the Tudunwada area of Kano state was set on fire. While two persons were burnt to death during the collation of the results of the House of Representatives election, which was announced to have been won by Dogunwa. Earlier, while addressing the journalists before his arrest, Dogunwa denied his involvement and disclosed he was yet to not receive any formal invitation from the police. Dogunwa said, “I never held a gun. I don’t even know how to hold a gun. I also never held any weapon throughout the election.”
