Paris Saint-Germain manager, Christophe Galtier, has identified defender Presnel Kimpembe as an important player in his squad. Galtier said Kimpembe is a natural leader, adding that the Frenchman is a crucial part of his team. Kimpembe came through PSG’s youth ranks and has been a part of the senior team since 2015. The 27-year-old has already made 234 appearances for PSG so far. Speaking about Kimpembe, who is also one of the side’s vice-captains of PSG, Galtier said (via RMC Sport): “Kimpembe is important, he is a child of the club. “He’ll not be at 150% yet. He’s a natural leader.”
