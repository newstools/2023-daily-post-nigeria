The All Progressives Congress has won the presidential election in Rivers State. This is after the result for Obio/Akpor local government area was announced, a few hours after the Returning Officer of the Independent National Electoral Commission for Rivers State, Professor Charles Adias, suspended the collation of election results, citing threat to his life. APC won the election in the LGA with 80,239 votes. The Labor Party had 3,829 votes, while the Peoples Democratic Party had 368 votes. The result was, however, not accepted by the state Chairman of LP, Dienye Pepple, who caused a scene at the state collation center.
