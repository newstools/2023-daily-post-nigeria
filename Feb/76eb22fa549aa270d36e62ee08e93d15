The trial of Mukaila Lamidi, popularly known as Auxiliary, will resume on April 27 at the Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court in Ibadan. He was arraigned on November 17, 2022, for alleged destruction of billboards of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidates. Auxiliary, 61, faces a six-count charge bordering on conspiracy, unlawful damage and breach of public peace. The court did not sit on Thursday with no reason given, but counsels agreed on the adjourned date. The prosecutor ASP Sunday Fatola said the defendant and others at large conspired to commit the offence. On November 13 at Ido, Auxiliary and co. allegedly damaged a billboard bearing APC House of Representatives candidate Aderemi Oseni. On the same day at Igboore, they allegedly damaged billboards bearing the pictures of APC presidential, governorship, and other candidates. The offence contravened the provisions of sections 249 (d), 451 and 517 of the Criminal Code Laws of Oyo State, 2000. Chief Magistrate Taiwo Oladiran admitted Auxiliary to bail in the sum of N500,000 with two sureties in like sum. Auxiliary was sentenced to six years imprisonment for conspiracy to murder during the late Governor Abiola Ajimobi government. In July 2016, Justice Eni Esan of the Oyo State High Court jailed him alongside Abu Kareem, Saidi Kareem and Kazeem Kayode. They were tried for the March 2014 mayhem at Iwo Road interchange which left a medical student Adekunle Oladipupo and others dead.
