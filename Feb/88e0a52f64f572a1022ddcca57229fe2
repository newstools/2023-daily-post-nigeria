British broadcaster, Piers Morgan, has insisted that Manchester City should receive an ‘immediate points deduction’ for being charged in relation to breaking Premier League’s financial rules. Man City were charged on Monday with breaking the English top-flight league’s financial rules more than 100 times regarding sponsors and contracts across nine seasons. Should Man City be found guilty, the Premier League champions face a range of potential sanctions – including a points deduction and expulsion – much to the delight of Morgan, a passionate Arsenal fan. In response to a Tweet listing the numerous rules which Pep Guardiola’s side had breached, Morgan wrote: “Outrageous. Immediate points deduction!”. If a point deduction – similar to that of Juventus in the Serie A – were to be dealt to Man City, it would likely mean that Arsenal would win the Premier League title this season. As it stands, Arsenal are five points clear of their closest challengers Man City on the log and have a game in hand on the Citizens – meaning they could lead by eight points.
