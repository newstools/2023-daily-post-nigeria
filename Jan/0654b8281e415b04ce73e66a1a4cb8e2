A man believed to be in his 50s identified as Baba Nuru (Nuru’s father) attempted to commit suicide in Lagos State in the early hours of Monday. An eyewitness who got to the scene after he was rescued said the incident occurred in a neighbourhood along the Bogije-Lakowe axis near the Ajah area. The citizen narrated how the man complained of hardship and hopelessness since things went bad for him in the past year. Matters got worse after the vehicle he and colleagues were using for transport business within and outside the state broke down. Drama started when students on their way to school raised an alarm about the sighting of a man on high tension wire, attempting to end it all. The noise of the learners attracted residents who rushed to find an individual gradually climbing to touch the wire attached to the dangerous power equipment. “I heard it was around 5:30 – 6 a.m. when the children screamed. People came out and begged the man to come down,” the witness told DAILY POST Monday evening. “The area boys around the place stated that begging the man won’t solve the situation as he appears determined. They stoned him with sticks and other objects. “The man fell but was not really injured. He said his landlord threw out his belongings after months of inability to pay rent; that the wife left him some weeks ago with their three children.” Asked to describe the dejected man, the witness replied “He looks like someone between 50 and 55 years old. He wore a white singlet and boxers. They called him Baba Nuru.” Some residents were said to have suggested that the man be taken to Elemoro Police Station under Area J Command, while others recommended a psychiatric hospital.
