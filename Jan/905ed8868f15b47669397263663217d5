The House of Representatives member, representing Afikpo North/South Federal Constituency, in the national assembly, Iduma Igariwey at the weekend tasked governor David Umahi to constitute a judicial panel of inquiry to investigate the killing of a seven-month pregnant woman in Ekoli Edda community. Recall that there was commotion in Ekoli Edda community, resulting from a power tussle that existed between the state chairman of All Progressives Congress, APC, Stanley Okoro Emegha, and the former chairman of Afikpo South LGA, Eni Uduma Chima. DAILY POST reports that the said commotion led to the killing of four youths including a police officer and setting ablaze of houses and other valuables in the area. Igariwey, who is seeking reelection, however, called on Ebonyi state government led by David Umahi to immediately constitute a judicial panel of inquiry to investigate the remote and immediate causes of the mayhem in Afikpo South. The House of Representatives member, Igariwey, made this known while speaking with newsmen at his hometown in Afikpo North LGA. He urged the warring factions in the Ekoli-Edda in the local government which led to the mayhem to sheathe their swords and allow peace to reign. “It is not enough to detain one or two persons in what amounts to protective custody without getting to the root cause of the problem”, he stressed.
