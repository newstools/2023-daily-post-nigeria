Veteran Nigerian entertainer and activist, Charles Chukwuemeka Oputa, popularly known as Charly Boy or Area Fada, has issued a warning to the general overseer of Omega Fire Ministries International, Apostle Johnson Suleman. Recall that Suleman has been making headlines over his alleged sexcapades with Nollywood actress Halima Abubakar and other celebrities. Halima had made revelations about how the cleric allegedly slept with her even when she was bleeding and how she had three abortions for him. Reacting to this, Charly Boy, on Tuesday, in a tweet on his Twitter handle, stated that it was no longer news that many pastors in Nigeria engaged in fraudulent activities. Warning Apostle Suleman to be careful, he narrated that he dreamt about him being attacked by women, and his manhood was cut off. ”Not that I always like to yab pastors’, but I know many Nigerian pastors are either just scumbags or fraudulent. That’s putting it mildly, but this one takes the cake. Suleman, you better be careful, I dreamt last night that some women attacked and cut off your manhood,” he claimed. Speaking further, Charly Boy advised the Apostle about a new business idea, claiming ”since all you know is balling women, why don’t you open a brothel. Another business idea though.”
