Arsenal are set to beat Chelsea to the signing of Moises Caicedo from Brighton. The north London giants have submitted a new bid for the South American midfielder. The Daily Mail report that Mikel Arteta’s side have added another £10 million to their £60 million submitted to Brighton. But the newspaper further reported that Brighton are set to reject the bid as they look to receive £80 million for the 21-year-old.
Caicedo is keen to leave Brighton, with the south coast outfit already rejecting a previous bid from Arsenal. Chelsea, who have made six signings this month, are also interested.
