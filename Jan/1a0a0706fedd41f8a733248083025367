Former Premier League player and manager, Graeme Souness has slammed Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris for his role in their defeat to Aston Villa on New Year’s Day. Antonio Conte’s Spurs were booed off the pitch by their home fans after putting in a dismal performance against Unai Emery’s Villa as they fell to a 2-0 defeat. Emi Buendia and Douglas Luiz were the scorers for Aston Villa as Spurs slipped out of the top four. Lloris was at fault for the first goal after spilling Luiz’s long-range shot, which allowed Ollie Watkins to set up Buendia. Souness certainly thinks so, telling Sky Sports: “I’m not a fan of Lloris. He is past his sell-by date. Since the start of last season, he has made four errors which have led to goals – that’s the worst record of any goalkeeper.”
