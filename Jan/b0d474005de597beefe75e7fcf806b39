Following the relatively improved security situation in the state, residents of Kaduna State and its environs have vowed to come out en masse and vote for candidates of their choice in the February 25, 2023, presidential election. The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has scheduled the presidential election to hold on February 25, 2023. Some residents of the state who spoke to DAILY POST in Kaduna on Friday, expressed their eagerness to vote for the candidate of their choice if insecurity is completely wiped out and their right to vote is not hindered. While they refused to disclose their choice of candidates, they promised to vote for a candidate that would provide dividends of democracy. John Abdul, a businessman said if there are no security breaches, he is ready to cast his vote. Delicious Moses, a federal government employee, said she was ready to exercise her voting rights if given the opportunity. Also, Musa Arungo, who sells petty foods said ” I have learnt a lesson from this present government, and I am ready to vote when the time comes.” Hajara Musa, a staff of Kaduna Polytechnic, said her PVC is available and she is ready to use it when the time comes. While insecurity in the state is not completely eradicated, it has drastically reduced following the deployment of security operatives across the 23 local government areas to deal with bandits and other criminals terrorising the state.
