Foremost oil magnate, Prince Arthur Eze has insisted that a northern presidential candidate is the best for Ndigbo. Eze said support for a northern candidate by Ndigbo will help them form the needed alliance that will help the people of the region attain power in the near future. The famous philanthropist had, two weeks ago, jolted many when he announced that he will not support the Labour Party presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi, adding that Obi was not capable of winning the election, and that he (Eze) had told him so during a private visit. Eze, who paid a courtesy call to the Director General of Atiku/Okowa Presidential campaign council in Anambra, Prof. Obiora Okonkwo, at the weekend in his country home in Ogidi, called for support for the presidential candidate of the PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. He stated that his (Atiku’s) administration would liberate Nigeria and benefit the South East more than any other region in the country. “I urge the people of the South-east to continue the strategic relationship by supporting Atiku Abubakar in the February elections. The long-standing alliance between the North and the South East has always produced many political benefits to the region. “I have known Atiku Abubakar to be an honest man, liberal, and a pan-Nigerian who aspires best for the nation, and he is committed to the renaissance of ndi-Igbo. “He has demonstrated his huge love and concern for us ndi-Igbo by continuously choosing an Igbo man to be his running mate since 2007 when he picked Senator Ben Ndi Obi; again in 2019 when he picked Peter Obi; and now, Ifeanyi Okowa, an Igbo man from Delta State. He was willing to scale back his ambition if the ticket was micro-zoned to the South-east; only Atiku Abubakar agreed to such terms,” he said.
