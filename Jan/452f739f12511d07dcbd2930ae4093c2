French Football pundit, Daniel Riolo, has claimed that PSG forward, Neymar is no longer respected by anyone. Riolo said this while singling Neymar out for his behaviour during PSG’s 7-0 thrashing of French side Pays de Cassel in the Coupe de France on Monday night. Five goals from Kylian Mbappe and a goal each from Neymar and Carlos Soler ensured PSG defeated Pays de Cassel at Stade Bollaert-Delelis. During the encounter, Neymar was singled out by a cross-section of Pay e Cassel supporters because of his antics during the Coupe de France tie. The former Barcelona star also picked up a yellow card during the 26th minute of the game. “He [Neymar] is able to be whistled even by an audience of Regional 1. He scores, and he chambers, we’ll eventually find out that he has a bad mind and that he’s not good,” Riolo told RMC sport. “The guy is no longer respected by anyone.”
