Arsenal head coach, Mikel Arteta has said that midfielder, Thomas Partey will go for an MRI scan on Saturday to assess the extent of a rib injury he sustained in the Gunners’ FA Cup 1-0 defeat to Manchester City on Friday night. Partey started the game at the Etihad Stadium but did not return for the second half. The Ghanaian international was replaced by Albert Sambi Lokonga as Arsenal eventually lost against Pep Guardiola’s side, following Nathan Ake’s only goal of the encounter. “He felt something, and we did not want to take any risks, so he couldn’t continue,” said Arteta in his post-match interview. “He had some discomfort, and it was getting worse and worse, so he couldn’t continue. He was not comfortable continuing. “Obviously, tomorrow, the day after, he’ll have to have an MRI scan and see what he has,” he added.
