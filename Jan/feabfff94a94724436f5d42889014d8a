Workers at the Moshood Abiola Polytechnic (MAPOLY), Abeokuta, on Wednesday took to the street to protest over their “unpaid three months salaries.” The workers had trooped out in their numbers to also condemn the non-implementation of the new minimum wage, the lack of promotion since 2019 as well as unpaid 55 months pension arrears. Carrying placards with different inscriptions, the workers clamoured that: “We want new management, release our promotion as and when due and please pay our salaries. The protesters, who were earlier at the school’s Administrative block, later barricaded the main entrance to the school. Speaking with journalists during the protest, the chairman of the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Polytechnics, (SSANIP) in MAPOLY, Dada Olalekan, said the Ogun State Government should borrow a leaf from Oyo, Lagos and Osun State Governments, asking it to take over the account of the polytechnic and pay directly from government covers. Olalekan said, “The reason we are here is to demand for our entitlements. The management of MAPOLY is owing us three months salary from October 2022. All other institutions and government agencies are collecting minimum wage, but MAPOLY has refused to implement the minimum wage. The management is owing us 55 months pension arrears. As I speak, nobody has a pension future here. If anybody retires tomorrow, there’s no future or pension for that person.”
