A team of Police detectives from Ofuoma Division and Ekiugbo Community Vigilante arrested three members of a blackmail gang, identified as Cornelius Emene, 32, and Nelson Aghogho, aka Little, and Ufuoma Tunde. The suspects were arrested by the Police after a victim lodged a complaint at Ofuoma Division Police Station that she sighted one of the hoodlums that kidnapped her in December 2022. She was reportedly held hostage in a hotel in Iwherekpokpor Community, Ughelli North Local Government Area, during which her captors took nude pictures of her, recorded her on video while inserting a candle on her private part and used the video and photos to blackmail her parents to pay a ransom. The Delta State Police Command in a statement signed by the Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe confirmed the arrest. According to him: “During preliminary investigation, the suspect made useful statements that led to the arrest of two other suspects, Nelson Aghogho, aka Little and Ufuoma Tunde (female). He also gave accounts of how they kidnapped another student of the School of Health and Technology Ofuoma, Ughelli North LGA.” The statement clarified further: “The modus operandi of the syndicate is to lure unsuspecting young girls on Facebook, get them to a hotel, drug them, gang-rape them, hold them hostage and demand ransom from their parents to secure their release.” DSP Edafe said numerous sex videos of previous victims used for blackmail purposes were found on the suspect’s phone. The three suspects are currently in custody and investigation is ongoing, Edafe informed.
