Chelsea have agreed a £29m deal with PSV Eindhoven to sign Noni Madueke. According to Sky Sports, there are still little details to thrash out, before the player flies to the UK to complete the transfer. Madueke started his youth career at Crystal Palace before he moved to Tottenham. The 22-year-old then left Spurs in 2018 for PSV, where he established himself as a first-team regular during the 2020/2021 campaign and scored nine goals in 35 games last season. The deal will take Chelsea’s spending in January window to £190m. The Blues already spent £270m in the summer after Todd Boehly took over the club. Madueke will become Chelsea’s sixth signing of the January transfer window, following the arrivals of Mykhailo Mudryk, Joao Felix, Benoit Badiashile, David Datro Fofana and Andrey Santos.
