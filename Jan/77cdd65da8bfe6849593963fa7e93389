Lionel Messi is unwilling to put pen to paper on a new contract with Paris Saint-Germain and could leave the Ligue 1 champions in the summer. The 35-year-old is out of contract in June, but he was expected to sign a one-year extension with PSG. Marca reports Messi is not motivated to win more titles in France or the Champions League again, after winning the 2022 World Cup with Argentina. He may return to Argentina or move to the MLS, with David Beckham’s Inter Miami interested. Barcelona aren’t expected to try and re-sign their greatest ever player due to their financial woes. Messi would need to agree to a significantly lower salary if he returns to Barca, but that is also the case if he moves to Argentina. An emotional return to his boyhood club Newell’s Old Boys has been rumoured. Miami would also not be able to match Messi’s salary at PSG, but in the past, he has previously spoken about playing in the MLS and owns a property in Miami.
