The Police on Thursday arraigned an unemployed Man, Michael Shedrack, before a Kado Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, for allegedly stealing a mobile phone worth N740,000. The police charged Shedrack with no fixed address of theft. The prosecutor, Stanley Nwafoaku, told the court that on January 15, at about 11:00 am, Mr Abdalsalam Abdulsalam of Suleja, Niger reported the matter at Utako Police station. Nwafoaku said that on January 12, the complainant pulled over at Krystal lounge Wuse 11 Abuja, to ask for directions to a particular place. He alleged that the defendant and his accomplice, now at large, approached the complainant to park his vehicle properly; in the process, they stole his iPhone 13 Promax, valued N740, 000. The prosecutor told the court that the defendant was immediately arrested. However, his accomplice escaped with the phone to an unknown destination. Nwafoaku said during the police investigation, Shedrack admitted to the crime. He said that the offence contravened sections 79 and 288 of the penal code. The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge. The defence counsel, Charity Nwosu, made a bail application for the defendant in the most liberal terms. She said Nwosu promised that the defendant would not jump bail if granted. The prosecution counsel, however, did not object to the bail application made by the defence counsel. The Judge, Muhammed Wakili, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N200, 000 and one surety in like sum. Wakili ordered that the surety must provide a BVN printout, a recent passport photograph and a valid identification card, which must be verified by the court registrar.
