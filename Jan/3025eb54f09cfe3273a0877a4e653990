President Muhammadu Buhari and the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu, have asked members of the party in Adamawa State to give Nigeria its first female governor come March 11. Both Buhari and Tinubu who were in Yola on Monday for the combined presidential and state governorship campaign flag-off of the APC said the people had a chance to vote into office the governorship candidate of the party, Senator Aishatu Ahmed Binani, the only female governorship candidate of a major political party for the coming election. “There has not been a female governor since we started the system. We are to present one, and she is going to win, God willing,” Buhari said about Binani. Speaking in the same vein, Tinubu referred to Binani as the next Adamawa State governor and Nigeria’s first female governor who will ensure adequate employment and promote welfare for all. “Today, you are about to send the first woman governor to the State House,” he said, charging the APC supporters who thronged the campaign venue to go ahead and do that when the governorship election comes up on March 11. Speaking of his own aspiration, Tinubu said his government will banish hunger and restore farming if he becomes the next president. Tinubu asserted that his administration would work hard to relieve Nigerians of poverty, saying, “Whatever they say in Poverty Development Party, you know their name, Poverty Development Party, we will replace it with joy, prosperity, happiness and employment.” Stressing that his government would be people-focused, Tinubu added: “All of you, expect that we will engage you properly. We will get you employed, we will pay attention to your needs.”
