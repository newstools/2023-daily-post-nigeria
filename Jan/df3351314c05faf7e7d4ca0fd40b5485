Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola has refuted the remarks he purportedly made against All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, ahead of the 2023 election. A rebuttal on Wednesday by media adviser Sola Fasure noted that jittery politicians are “scared of full reconciliation.” Fasure said a pattern has emerged of sinister and coordinated efforts to frustrate the reconciliatory moves being championed by notable stakeholders. He said meetings within and beyond the APC seek to rally all necessary factors for the success of the ruling party at the February 2023 election. The statement accused the authors of the “malicious manuscript” of paying a handful of rent-a-crowd comedians to react to a non-existent ‘attack’ to frustrate peace talks for their selfish interest. Fasure advised Nigerians to be wary of the evil machinations of fifth columnists, whose sole business is to cause disaffection, manufacture distractions and sow discord within the APC. “Rauf Aregbesola is focused on delivering key reforms in the Ministry and its agencies as championed by President Muhammadu Buhari, and also ensure that the APC emerges victorious at the General Elections,” the aide added.
