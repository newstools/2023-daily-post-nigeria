The aspiration of Alhaji Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso to become the president of Nigeria on the platform of the New Nigerian Peoples Party, NNPP, at the forthcoming general elections suffered a setback on Sunday when the North East zonal secretary of the party, Dr Babayo Liman, resigned from the party and decamped to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, along with his supporters. Briefing newsmen on the reasons behind his exit from his former political party, Liman said the party has “no single structure on ground that would warrant it winning an election at the national level.” He also avowed that the presidential candidate of the party has no capacity “to triumph in the forthcoming general elections.” Liman who said he has left the party for good said: “I resigned my appointment as the North East zonal secretary of the NNPP and join PDP to support Atiku Abubakar and the PDP guber candidate for Taraba State.” He cited the cold war wreaking havoc on the Bauchi State chapter of the NNPP, which he alleged the presidential candidate could not resolve, as an indication that entrusting Nigeria to him will not augur well for Nigerians. Liman averred that apart from Kano State, which he [Kwankwaso] presided over as governor, there is no other strong credential to showcase to show that he can handle the affairs of Nigeria. He claimed that all the executives of the party in the North East have dumped the NNPP. Some of the party chieftains in Taraba who spoke with DAILY POST said they are also on the verge of toeing the paths of party’s executives who are “now dining and wining with either APC or PDP.”
