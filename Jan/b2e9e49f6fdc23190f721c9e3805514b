The Social Democratic Party (SDP) gubernatorial candidate in the 2023 general elections in Oyo State, Barrister Michael Lana has threatened to sue Governor Seyi Makinde of the state over what he described as illegal acquisition of land. Lana, a former Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice in the state alleged that some lands have been taken over by the present administration led by Makinde. The SDP candidate, who spoke on Wednesday, explained that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government led by Makinde had deprived over 5,000 villagers in the state of their right. Lana made these disclosures while speaking during a program organised by the Political Commission of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Oyo State chapter, tagged “One on one with Oyo Workers”. The SDP candidate, while addressing the workers, said he planned to engage the government on setback giving to the outer ring road which was originally 75 meters and increased to 500 meters by the present administration in the state. Lana insisted that he will review acquisition of land acquired for free trade zone from Guru Mahara Ji to boundary between Oyo and Ogun States along the Lagos/Ibadan expressway when he becomes the governor in May 2023. He added that it is wrong under the law to acquired land for a particular purpose and use it for another purpose. Lana said, “The setback have deprived over 5,000 villagers of their land, I will reverse it if I become the governor, and if I don’t win, I will still sue the government. “You can not just take people’s land for private investment, it is unlawful and illegal. “If I become the governor, I will create anti-land grabbing law which will fight for the right of our citizens free of charge so that they can get their land back from any land grabbers, if you want anybody’s land, tell them, pay for it, and they will sell it to you”.
