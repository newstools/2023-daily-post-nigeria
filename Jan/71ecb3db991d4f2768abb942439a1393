The National Judicial Commission, NJC, has confirmed Justice Abdullateef Kamaldeen as the new substantive Grand Khadi of Kwara State Shariah Court of Appeal. Governor Abdulrahaman Abdulrazaq disclosed this in a congratulatory message issued by Rafiu Ajakaye, his Chief Press Secretary in Ilorin, on Saturday. He was first appointed the Acting Grand Khadi on February 16, 2022, after his predecessor Justice Muhammad Ola AbdulKadir retired from the service. In a statement on Saturday, the Governor said the new Grand Khadi comes to the job highly recommended owing to his personal accomplishments and his noble ancestry traced to great, pious scholars. “We are convinced that the Grand Khadi will always make the state proud as the head of the Kwara State Shariah Court of Appeal. “The confirmation of his appointment comes as no surprise, given his pedigree as a disciplined and well-versed legal officer with impressive leadership credentials,” the statement said. “We pray Allah, exalted is He, to guide and protect the new Grand Khadi, give him good health, and ease his affairs as he takes up this important role,” the governor added.
