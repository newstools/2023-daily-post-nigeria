The Nigerian Police Force Public Relations Officer, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, has debunked reports that some police officers were planning to protest over unpaid salary arrears. Adejobi on Sunday stressed that the Nigeria Police Force does not pay the salaries of its personnel, but the Office of the Accountant General, AG, and through the IPPIS. He also denied the fact that senior officers had been paid the said salary arrears, stressing that all senior officers have not been paid their arrears of increment. “As a CSP and Force PRO, I have not got my arrears. The arrears are to be paid by the AG, IPPIS, and not the police. We do not pay Police salaries. “The rank and files have been considered. So, all the issues raised in the piece are distorted, fabricated to suit a purpose, and above all, mischievous. “Not salaries, but arrears of the increment. We have been receiving normal increased salaries since then, but arrears from Jan to June 2022 and part has been paid to rank and files. It’s bit by bit, more so that it was not captured in the 2022 budget,” he explained. He said the police authority didn’t have much to talk about on police salaries, because the Federal Government is responsible for payment. The News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, reports that there had been stories on social media about an alleged planned mega protest in Lagos by some officers over six months’ unpaid arrears of increment. The stories alleged that the upper echelon of the police, from Assistant Commissioners of Police, ACP, to the Inspector-General of Police, had been paid four months of the arrears. The story further claimed that those on grade levels 03 to 06 and a few of 07 were paid, while those on grade levels 08, 09, 10 and 11 were not paid.
