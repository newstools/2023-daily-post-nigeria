Military veterans in Ekiti State have appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to save them from hunger and poverty. The veterans, some of whom served in the Nigeria Civil War said their monthly pension is still unpaid. A statement signed by the Ekiti State secretary of the association, Alhaji Bello Oseni, yesterday said: “The situation of our men is very terrible, some are sick and cannot even afford to feed themselves. Some cannot afford a meal per day, and some with health challenges don’t have money to maintain their health challenges such as blindness and stroke. Others are homeless.” Alhaji Oseni noted: “On November 17th 2022, a sum of N134.7 billion was approved by President Buhari’s administration to pay the pensions of military veterans who fought in the Nigerian Civil War to take care of themselves and their families. “However, since the money was approved by President Buhari, the money is yet to be paid to us.” The veterans urge Nigerian lawmakers, the House of Representatives, the Senate, the state governors and President Buhari, who they commended for the approval, to have mercy on them and ensure that their monthly pensions arrears are paid without delay. “We humbly appeal to our President and those in charge to pay the veterans and put a smile on our face as we commemorate the 2023 armed forces remembrance day this year,” they urged.
