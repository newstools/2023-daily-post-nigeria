Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has unveiled a state anthem in an effort to instil patriotism in the citizens of the state. At the unveiling ceremony, which took place at Coronation Hall, Government House, Kano, on Sunday, he commended his wife, Professor Hafsat Abdullahi Ganduje for kickstarting the process that resulted in the development of the state anthem. “I am glad to see that what Her Excellency, my dear wife, Prof Hafsat Abdullahi Ganduje thought of, in developing state anthem, has come to fruition. She did well and she deserves our commendation,” he appreciated. Speaking further, he said: “We are here in order to show love for our state, our culture, our costumes, our history and to appreciate our state in general. “Ours is to promote love, deep sense of responsibility and to also show the greatness of our dear state. As our national anthem is bringing us together for the service and unity of our motherland, so also this state anthem will follow the same pattern at the state level.” To entrench the state anthem, Governor Ganduje said: “We are taking this anthem to the Kano State House of Assembly for legislation, that whenever we have any public function, after singing the national anthem, the state anthem will always follow.” The anthem is an ode to the state’s excellence in commerce, traditional leadership, scholarship, agriculture and hospitality which stem from rich culture and history.
