Good worth millions of naira were on Sunday lost after fire destroyed furniture shops at the popular timber market in Rumosi community in Obio Akpor local Government Area of Rivers State. The fire was said to have emanated from a heap of saw dust deposed by timber dealers in the market.  Some members of the Rumuosi timber union who spoke at the scene of the fire incident said the fire first started “on the 31st of December 2022”, but they were able to put it out at that time. The timber dealers said the fire started again “around 9am today” but they were unable to contain it. They said a shop owner was injured while trying to “save his goods” and has been rushed to the hospital. The timber dealers further advised the government to ensure fires service officers are established “in every corner of the state” regretting that “officials of the federal fire service arrived the scene late”.  Also speaking, the landlord of the Rumiosi timber market, Loveday Peter said they will “collaborate with the state government on alternative ways to dispose of the saw dust or recycle it”, to avert another fire incident. The fire incident had caused heavy traffic jam in the area.
