A 21-year-old man was on Friday sentenced to three years imprisonment for stealing a generator valued at N500,000. Victor Isaac was convicted by a Chief Magistrate Court sitting in Akure, Ondo State capital. Isaac was said to have committed the crime on January 8, 2023, at Imade street in Ijapo Estate, a highbrow axis of the state capital. While pleading guilty to the one-count charge of theft he was charged with; the convict informed the court that after stealing the generator, he sold it for N9,000. Counsel to the convict, Kehinde Osadugba, prayed the court to temper justice with mercy and pleaded that the convict did not give the court a tough time. He was found guilty of the crime by Presiding Magistrate Tope Aladejana, who sentenced him to three years in prison without an option of a fine.
