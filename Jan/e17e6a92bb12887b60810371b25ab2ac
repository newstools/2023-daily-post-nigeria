A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Rivers State, Princewill Dike, has told the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the state, Tonye Cole, to leave Fubara alone. Dike, who is the Secretary of the New Media Directorate of the PDP Campaign Council, described the party’s governorship candidate, Siminialayi Fubara as a man of action. Dike in a statement sent to DAILY POST, on Sunday, was reacting to Cole’s invitation to Fubara to address Rivers people on radio or television promising to foot the bills. He said: “Nothing can be more hilarious, or should we say, ludicrous than that public dramatisation. Must everybody be loquacious? Does speaking on radio or television make a good political leader?” “Unlike Cole, Fubara is a man of few words, but action filled. The Great Abraham Lincoln of evergreen memory asserts that ‘actions speak louder than words’. Back home, our own Kongi, Prof. Wole Soyinka in the Lion and the Jewel opines that the strength of the lion is not in its mien but in the tail.” Dike said instead of chasing shadows, Cole should dissipate his energy explaining how he became a billionaire and furnishing details of how he used his company, Sahara Energy, to purchase state assets such as the Olympic Hotel [and] the gas turbine among others at the expense of the people. Dike argued that Fubara remained poles ahead of Cole in popularity explaining that while the APC candidate is an alien, his PDP counterpart is a thoroughbred Rivers man. He said: “Fubara grew up here, had all his schooling here, worked here, retired here, joined active politics here. A Port Harcourt homeboy, a grassroots fellow.”
