The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar has called for the extension of the January 31st deadline for the naira swap. Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Governor Godwin Emefiele had said the 100 days time frame from late last year was sufficient. But the former Vice President said the people are suffering non-availability of cash, though he understands the situation was not intended. In a video on Twitter, Atiku observed that the CBN decision to redesign the naira notes has generated wide reactions within and outside the country. He noted that a great number of Nigerians have expressed apprehension about how the policy and the deadline will make life difficult for them. Atiku confirmed the challenges farmers and artisans in remote areas go through in moving cash to commercial banks for exchange. Stressing that the ultimatum is going to cause heavy discomfort for citizens, he advised the Federal Government and the CBN to act. Atiku appealed to the authorities to “ease the burden of the people” while sensitisation on the imperative of mobile banking policy continues. “It is important for the CBN to consider an extension for the public to swap their old notes thereby reducing the financial consequences on these vulnerable citizens”, he added.
