Godwin Emefiele, the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, on Tuesday finally appeared before the House of Representatives Committee, investigating the Naira swap exercise. The Committee and delegation of the CBN are currently meeting at the National Assembly. The meeting commenced around 12:05 pm after over one-hour behind closed doors. It would be recalled that several threats of arrest were issued by the House and the Committee on Thursday after Mr Emefiele shunned the House. The CBN boss had announced an extension of the deadline for the new currency swap till 10th February. However, the committee has insisted that Emefiele must appear before them. At the commencement of the meeting, the Chairman of the Committee, Ado Doguwa said the CBN boss provided reasons for missing previous invitations. More to comeâ€¦
