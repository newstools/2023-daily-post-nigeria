Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State has expressed concern over the mass arrest of residents around the Ndiegoro area of Aba by officers of the Nigeria Police Force, as a result of the alleged killing of some policemen around the area. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Onyebuchi Ememanka, on Friday, Ikpeazu frowned at the act of hostility against any security agent in the state let alone the killing of a police officer under any guise. According to him, “the peace and security we all enjoy here and which has set Abia State apart as an oasis of peace is largely attributable to the gallantry and committment of the officers of the different security agencies in the state.” “It is therefore preposterous and unacceptable that the same officers who strive day and night for our safety will recieve any form of hostility from the citizens,” the Abia Governor lamented. Ikpeazu assured of his administration’s committment to synergize and work with the police in the state to fish out the perpetrators of the heinous act and ensure they face the law. He also assured innocent citizens in the area that his administration is already in talks with all the service commanders of different security agencies in the state with a view to bringing the situation under control, and ensure that peace and tranquility returns to the area. “Innocent citizens must be protected at all costs. That is the position of the law,” the Governor insisted. Ikpeazu urged innocent citizens to remain calm and go about their normal businesses without fear or hindrance.
