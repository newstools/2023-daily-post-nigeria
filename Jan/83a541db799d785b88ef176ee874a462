The group hailed the former Head of State for endorsing Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate, Peter Obi. A statement by the Convener, Vincent Ezekwueme said Obasanjo had always stood for what is right and fair. Ezekwueme said Obi would revamp and transform Nigeria in tandem with the philosophy and ideology of the founding fathers. “The reason why we are being governed as fools is because good people sit back and do nothing”, he noted. Ezekwueme added that Obasanjo has engraved his name in the hearts and minds of Nigerians and beyond. “The former leader is seeking to entrench good governance, inclusiveness, justice, equality and equity,” the statement added. He urged well-meaning Nigerians to speak out against the “numerous challenges bedeviling the country”.
