The All Progressives Congress, APC, gubernatorial candidate in Abia State, Dr Uchechukwu Sampson Ogah, on Sunday, called on eligible citizens and residents of the state to collect their Permanent Voter Cards, PVCs, to enable them to exercise the civic rights and responsibilities in the forthcoming elections. Ogah, a former minister, made the call on Sunday on the backdrops of the recent declaration of Monday and Tuesday as public holidays by the state government. Recall that the government had, in a release by the Secretary to the State Government, SSG, Barrister Chris Ezem, on Saturday, announced Monday 23rd and Tuesday 24th January 2023 as public holidays for PVC collection. Dr Ogah tasked the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to ensure adequate logistics are provided to fasten all processes in achieving smooth collection of PVCs. INEC has extended the deadline for registered voters to collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) until Sunday, January 29, 2023, from the initial January 22. The commission also vowed to punish any staff found to have extorted or discriminated against any registered voter in the issuance of the PVCs. The National Commissioner in charge of Information and Voter Education Committee, Mr Festus Okoye, disclosed this in a statement issued in Abuja.
