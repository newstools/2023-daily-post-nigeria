The Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, said investment in technology is key to achieving economic growth. According to the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media & Publicity Office of the Vice President, Laolu Akande on Tuesday, Nigeria’s second most powerful personality, made this disclosure while receiving a delegation of the Odu’a Investment Company at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. While commending the legacy of the conglomerate and the vision that birthed it decades ago, Prof Osinbajo said, “legacy and history have a powerful pull, but it might be that what the future calls for are even greater and this is why we must be investing in technology.” He stressed the need for technologically driven investment as the panacea to development. He added, “If the private sector runs businesses, it is far better because it will bring greater dividends.” He further cited the success recorded by Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Company (NLNG), saying its private sector driven model is fetching the country a lot of revenue.
