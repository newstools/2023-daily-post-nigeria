The All Progressives Congress, APC, has accused the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, of sponsoring thugs against President Muhammadu Buhari in Kano State. APC said PDP committed a treasonable felony by sponsoring thugs to attack Buhari during his visit to Kano. Felix Morka, the National Publicity Secretary of APC, urged security agencies to investigate and probe the former ruling party over the attack on Buhari. In a statement, Morka accused PDP of setting the most ignominious, debased, and virulent campaign records in the history of the country. Morka said the “statement issued by PDP on President Muhammadu Buhari’s recent visit to Kano is nothing short of a confessional statement of conspiracy to commit felony. By actively instigating and sponsoring fringe violent anti-social conduct by paid urchins during the presidential engagement in Kano, PDP has crossed the line of fair campaign engagement into grievous criminality. “This is unacceptable and demands urgent law enforcement investigation and prosecution of all participants in this high crime.”
