Former Rangers manager Ally McCoist has compared Chelsea’s new signing Mykhailo Mudryk to the club’s legend Eden Hazard, describing him as a flying machine. The former Chelsea and Rangers man was impressed by Mudryk’s performance against Liverpool in his first match for the Blues. McCoist noted that the young forward was quicker than Hazard who left Stamford Bridge for Real Madrid a couple of years ago. Mudryk, who Chelsea hijacked from Arsenal, came off the bench for teenager Lewis Hall in the 55th minute. The Ukraine international instantly improved Graham Potter’s attack. “I’m having him. He looks like the real deal. I’ll tell you what he is, he’s a lot quicker than Hazard. He is a flying machine,” McCoist told talkSPORT. “He was on for two minutes and James Milner was chasing him like me at the six-a-side at this moment in time.”
