The Court of Appeal has dismissed the verdict of the Federal High Court Katsina which nullified the primary election that produced Muritala Shehu as the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, candidate for Malumfashi/Kafur Federal Constituency, Katsina State. Murtala filed the appeal against the decision of the Federal High Court Katsina, which on November 23, 2022, nullified the primary election in which he emerged as winner against Nasiru Sa’ad Ahmed. In a unanimous decision delivered on the 27th of January, 2023, the Court of Appeal set aside in its entirety the judgment of the Federal High Court, affirming the PDP primary election conducted for Malumfashi/Kafur Constituency and declared Muritala Shehu who scored the highest vote as the House of Representatives candidate for the party. However, the appeal was heard on the appellant’s brief of argument only, as the respondent, Nasiru Sa’ad Ahmed did not file anything before the court to defend the appeal until he was out of time to do so. Reacting to the judgement, Katsina PDP Legal Adviser, Barrister, Mahutta Mustapha, said: “The judgement represents the true position of the PDP primary election conducted on 22 May, 2022 wherein the appellant, Murtala Shehu emerged the winner. “It also represents the true wish of the delegates from Malumfashi/Kafur Constituency who voted for Murtala Shehu wherein he had 34 votes in the primary election, while his opponent had 29 votes.” He added that, “certainly, cases between members of the party do not result in anything beneficial to the party. They should unite and support whoever emerges.”
