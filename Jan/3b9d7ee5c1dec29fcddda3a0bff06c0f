Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has ordered the imposition of a 24-hour curfew on Ikare-Akoko, the headquarters of Akoko North East Local Government Area of the state. According to the directive issued on Thursday by the governor, the curfew takes immediate effect in the community. In a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Richard Olatunde, the curfew became imperative following a violent clash that broke out in the community during the New Year’s carnival. On Wednesday, crisis enveloped the community when some youths clashed over the venue of the carnival at Okoja quarters. While urging security agencies in the state to ensure maximum enforcement of the curfew, Akeredolu said the two traditional rulers in the area must caution their wards as anyone caught flouting the directive would be dealt with. The statement reads: “This follows the escalated violent clash in the town since Tuesday which has continued unabated, despite the meeting held by Government and the Olukare of Ikare, Oba Akadiri Momoh and Owa Ale of Iyometa, Oba Adeleke Adegbite to rein-in their subjects. “Security agencies have been directed to ensure strict compliance with the order just as investigations are already on to unravel the real cause(s) of the violent clash. “For emphasis, Ikare Akoko has been closed down for any unauthorised human movement and activity until further notice.”
