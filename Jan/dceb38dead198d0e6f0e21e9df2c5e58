Arsenal goalkeeper, Aaron Ramsdale, was kicked by a Tottenham Hotspur fan following the Gunners’ Premier League derby 2-0 win on Sunday. The scuffle started as Ramsdale was confronted by Tottenham striker Richarlison after the whistle was blown, with security separating both players. Players moved over to follow the action, which ended up at the advertising hoarding, where the England international went to pick up his water bottle. A supporter from the home end stood up on the hoardings and kicked Ramsdale. It marks an ugly end to a North London Derby that was played in good spirits for the majority of proceedings. Arsenal defeated Antonio Conte’s side, thanks to an own-goal from Hugo Lloris and a goal from Martin Odegaard.
