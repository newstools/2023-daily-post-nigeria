Manchester City have signed Argentine, Maximo Perrone from Velez Sarsfield. The formalities of the deal were completed this January as parties involved had already reached agreement in December. The 20-year-old Perrone plays as a defensive midfielder and has recorded 33 appearances for Velez this season. He has netted twice from his defensive midfield position and provides three assists. Pep Guardiola has one reliable defensive midfielder in the person of Rodri as Kalvin Phillips who joined the club last summer has not hit the ground running. Phillips has not found his feet at the Etihad Stadium, playing just 152 minutes for City this season. Perrone could give Guardiola more options to work with in the future.
