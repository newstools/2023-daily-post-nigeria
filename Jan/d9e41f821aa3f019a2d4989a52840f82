Ahead of the forthcoming general elections, the spokesperson for Atiku, Okowa Presidential Campaign Organisation, Daniel Bwala, has slammed the opposition for making allegations he described as baseless against the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. The statement was contained in a post via his verified Twitter handle on Wednesday. Bwala’s statement is coming on the heels of recent verbal altercations between the camps of Atiku and the All Progressives Congress, APC, candidate, Bola Tinubu. The duo had traded words on corruption and each other’s health status. Both also called for the disqualification of each other as well. However, Bwala has come out to say that the opposition is filled with anxiety triggered by the fear of imminent presidential election defeat. He wrote, “They are suffering from Pantophobia, increased anxiety triggered by the fear of imminent presidential election defeat. They are now throwing everything in the kitchen sink.”
