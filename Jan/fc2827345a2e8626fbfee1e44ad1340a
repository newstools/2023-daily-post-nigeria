A governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Zamfara State, Ibrahim Shehu has been expelled for alleged anti-party activities. According to the expulsion letter signed by Hon. Aliyu Hassan, the party’s secretary in Mayana Ward, Shehu was expelled due to anti-party activities contrary to Article 58(1) (a,b,c) of the party’s 2017 amended constitution. The letter stated that the Mayana Ward Working Committee of the party took the decision effective from January 2023. DAILY POST recalls that Ibrahim Shehu was twice responsible for the nullification of the party’s governorship primary election. All efforts by DAILY POST to get a reaction from Ibrahim Shehu, a member of the Federal House of Representatives between 2011 and 2015, proved abortive. Meanwhile, the state chapter of the party claimed ignorant of the development, saying it has not been notified officially by the ward, and that the allegations against Shehu would be properly investigated before any action is taken.
