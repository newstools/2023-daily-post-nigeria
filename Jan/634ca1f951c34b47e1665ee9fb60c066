The Vatican has disclosed how Pope Emeritus, Benedict XVI, will be buried on Thursday. The information was contained in a post via its verified Twitter handle. The Vatican said the coffin of Pope Emeritus was closed on Wednesday based on tradition. Recall that emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger in Marktl, Southeastern Germany on April 16, 1927, died on 31 December, 2022. He was 95 years old. Before his death, he had encountered a sudden decline in his health due to age. “Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI’s coffin was closed in a ritual held Wednesday evening. As per tradition, the Pope Emeritus’ pallia, coins and medals minted during his pontificate, and a ‘rogito’ summarizing the highlights of his papacy, were also placed inside the casket. “Following the Requiem Mass, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI’s coffin will be transported through the Basilica and to the Vatican crypt for burial, in the first tomb of John Paul II. “He will be buried in the traditional triple coffin, with caskets made of cypress wood, zinc, and oak,” part of the statement read.
