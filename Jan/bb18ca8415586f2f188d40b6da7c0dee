Former Manchester United vice-captain, Patrice Evra has said he disagreed with the club’s legends, Gary Neville and Roy Keane over the club that will win the Premier League title this season. Neville and Keane had backed Manchester City to catch current Premier League leaders Arsenal. Man City are currently five points behind Arsenal on the log despite winning 14 of their 20 league games this season. But Evra, who won five Premier League titles at Man United, disagreed with the former Red Devils stars and backed Arsenal to end their long wait for a league title. “We keep saying Arsenal have proven themselves against Chelsea, against Tottenham and now against United, but everyone also keeps saying they have still got to face Man City,” Evra told Betfair. “If I was an Arsenal player, I would be fuming, I bet they can’t wait to play City. Even if City beat them in both matches in the Premier League, they still have a chance of winning the title if they are strong mentally. “I don’t agree with Roy Keane and Gary Neville, I don’t think City will win the league, I think Arsenal will win. The way they are playing consistently, I don’t see that with City.”
