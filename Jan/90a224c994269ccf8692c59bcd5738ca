French football pundit, Daniel Riolo, has hit out at Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar, branding him as a professional catastrophe when compared to his teammate Kylian Mbappe. Riolo also highlighted the difference between Neymar and Mbappe when it came to their professionalism in the game. Mbappe was hailed by many for making an early return to PSG after his participation at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar last December, where he led France to the final. The France international even featured in PSG’s last two matches against Strasbourg and Lens, leaving Riolo impressed. Speaking about Mbappe in After Foot on RMC, Riolo said: “He has ten days of vacation, he does what he wants, right? He doesn’t leave between two matches, he doesn’t leave without the agreement of the club, he leaves for ten days of post-World Cup vacation. “These are the ten days of vacation he had to take after the World Cup, which he didn’t completely take because he returned to play two very important resumption matches without taking any vacation to play them very quickly.” Mbappe was granted a break by PSG after their 3-1 defeat to Lens in a Ligue 1 tie on January 1. The 24-year-old then flew to New York to watch the Brooklyn Nets in the NBA, and Riolo has used Mbapp’s conduct to aim a dig at Neymar. He added, “Whether he [Mbappe] leaves at night in a private jet or in a hot air balloon to be in New York the next day to see a basketball game, he does what he wants, he won’t be back for ten days.” “Don’t talk to me about Neymar, who has demonstrated everything in terms of professional catastrophism, next to Mbappe, who is an example.”
