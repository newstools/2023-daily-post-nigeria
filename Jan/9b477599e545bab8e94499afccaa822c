Chelsea head coach, Graham Potter has provided an injury update on Raheem Sterling and Christian Pulisic following his side’s Premier League 1-0 defeat against Manchester City on Thursday. Sterling was substituted after just five minutes and could be seen holding his hamstring following a collision with Man City defender, John Stones during the encounter on Thursday night at Stamford Bridge. Pulisic, on the other hand, was also forced off after a crunching tackle from Stones on 22 minutes. Speaking to beIN SPORTS after Chelsea’s defeat to Pep Guardiola’s side, Potter said: “Raheem felt the back of his leg when he did a backheel, a strange action, a strange sensation, so fingers crossed. The Englishman then spoke to BBC Match of the Day and added: “It is too early to say with injuries. “Raheem felt it within the first minute of the game. And then with Christian [Pulisic] we are hoping it’s not too serious.”
