The management of Kwara State Polytechnic, Ilorin, has disowned the 23-year-old Awoleye Joshua Oluwatofunmi, who claimed to be a Mechanical Engineering student HND 1 of the institution and arrested by the state police command for swindling an African-American lady Volapolonius Moss. A statement signed by the Public Relations Officer of the institution, Halimat Garba, in Ilorin on Saturday, on behalf of the Registrar, said “the Management wishes to disclaim this malicious news about the polytechnic with the fact that Awoleye Joshua Oluwatofunmi is not a student of the institution. “Please, note that the said Awoleye was once a student of the institution, and had graduated from the polytechnic since 2021 with Lower Credit at National Diploma Level from Mechanical Engineering Department.” The management explained that although Awoleye was recently offered admission to study Mechanical Engineering at Higher National Diploma level, the admission was withdrawn when he refused to register. “He is therefore not a student of the polytechnic as only registered students are recognized by the institution. “On the strength of this, the Polytechnic Management enjoins all stakeholders and members of the public to always verify the veracity of anything tagged with the Polytechnic’s name before circulating same,” the statement added.
