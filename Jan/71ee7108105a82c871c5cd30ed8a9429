Accord Party (AP) presidential candidate, Professor Christopher Imumolen has suggested ways the Federal Government can effectively manage security challenges during the 2023 elections. Polls in some parts of the country are often marred due to cases of intimidation, violence, thuggery, ballot box snatching, attacks, assassinations, among others. Imumolen called for massive recruitment of ad hoc security personnel to cover for the shortfall in the available number of policemen and other operatives. The APC flagbearer noted that this would ensure sufficient room is not left for unscrupulous elements to scuttle the elections. “From available statistics which peg the number of policemen at 370,000, it is not possible to have adequate security cover for the 176,000 polling units on election days,” Imumolen said. “This shortage is what evil-minded persons can use to disrupt the elections. and cause mayhem like they have always done in the past. “Unmanned polling booths are a sure recipe for danger. Polling officials are not safe, voters are not safe. In fact, just about anything can happen. “This is why I suggest that ad hoc security personnel be recruited and trained right away to help cover for the deficit we currently have. “We ask Nigerians who are patriotic and interested in seeing to the success of the elections to come forward and volunteer their services,” he added. Imumolen however hailed INEC’s decision to deploy technology to enhance the process of voting, collation, and announcements of results. “INEC’s decision to embrace digital technology in place of the old analogue system is a good development because it will be more efficient,” the AP candidate said.
