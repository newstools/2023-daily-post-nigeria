Worried about the increasing sex scenes in Nigeriaâ€™s movie industry, Nollywood, clergyman and filmmaker Mike Bamiloye has written an open letter to his colleagues in the industry. In an open letter on his Instagram page, he castigated actors and actresses who kiss and act in erotic movies. According to him, most of his colleagues act in such scenes due to the money and popularity benefits. Speaking further, the sexagenarian said such ill scenes have led to many broken marriages and bred distrust between couples. The founder of Mount Zion Television also accused directors and producers who encourage such acts as lustful. The 62-year-old dramatist wrote:
