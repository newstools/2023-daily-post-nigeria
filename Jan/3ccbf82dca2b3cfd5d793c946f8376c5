Former Crystal Palace Chairman Simon Jordan has said that incoming Everton boss Sean Dyche is sometimes ‘misrepresented.’ Everton dismissed Frank Lampard earlier this week and Dyche is set to be appointed today. Jordan sees Dyche’s move to Everton as a good one by the Toffee’s board, adding that the former Burnley man should do well. He told talkSPORT, “I think there is a lot about Sean Dyche that gets misrepresented. “He doesn’t misrepresent himself or lack confidence because he’s very confident and believes that he’s capable of doing any job put in front of him. “I think it’s a sensible move. I hope that they’ve made it a proper contract.”
