National Assembly candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Ekiti State on Saturday described their purported suspension by the party as an “unnecessary distraction”. The candidates said in a press briefing that they would not be distracted but rather continue reaching out to voters in their constituencies to ensure their victories in the elections. Recall that the National Working Committee suspended about seven National Assembly candidates from the party over alleged anti-party activities. But addressing journalists in Ado Ekiti on Saturday, the candidates said the purported suspension will not affect their candidacy, stating that “our concern now is how to win elections and we will not be distracted.” The suspended Senatorial candidates are Alhaji Lateef Ajijola (Ekiti Central) and Hon. Funso Ayeni (Ekiti North), while the House of Representatives candidates are Otunba Yinka Akerele (Ekiti North 1), Hon. Babatunde Ajayi (Ekiti North 2), Lere Olayinka (Ekiti Central 2), Joju Fayose (Ekiti Central 1) and Mrs Emiola Adenike Jennifer (Ekiti South 2). They called on supporters of the party in the State to remain calm, assuring that nothing will be left undone to ensure their victories in the forthcoming elections.
