Former England striker, Darren Bent, has hit out at Manchester United forward Antony, criticizing his lack of real impact in games for the Red Devils. Bent branded Antony as a YouTube footballer, adding that all his tricks and flicks have no substance. Antony joined Man United from Ajax last summer for around €100 million. The Brazilian international has since scored five goals in 22 games across competitions for Erik ten Hag’s side. However, Antony has often been criticized for trying extravagant tricks and not creating enough goalscoring chances for Man United. “All tricks and flicks, no substance at the minute. He is doing all this stuff, but he is not going past anyone. It is not like he’s doing the trick to manipulate the ball to go past someone. He is just doing it for the sake of it. A little bit like the spin, at the time I was like ‘ah come on it is only a spin,'” Bent told talkSPORT. When asked by the show’s host Andy Goldstein if Antony is a ‘YouTube footballer’, Bent replied, “A little bit, yeah. You clip all the best bits of a footballer and you look at it on YouTube and go, ‘wow, I can’t believe we are signing him!’ But where is the substance in between, where is the end product? I know he started off alright at United, couple of good goals, but where is the end product?.”
