The Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Danbatta, was decorated with the 2022 Regulator of the Year Award at the 11th edition of the Vanguard Personality of the Year Awards. Various Nigerians who have distinguished themselves as achievers of excellence in their various fields of endeavours were honoured at the glamorous ceremony at the Eko Hotels & Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos on Friday. The award was conferred on Danbatta in recognition of the EVC’s effective regulatory achievements through cutting-edge initiatives, especially during his first five years in office during which Nigeria’s telecom sector has shown spectacular landmarks, According to Vanguard Newspaper Limited, the organizers of the event, his initiatives strengthened the role of the telecommunications sector as a major contributor to the growth of Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as well as telecoms investment inflows from $36 billion in 2015 to over $70 billion. Danbatta also spearheaded a campaign to improve Nigeria’s broadband penetration from the paltry five per cent at the time of his appointment to about 30% in 2018.
