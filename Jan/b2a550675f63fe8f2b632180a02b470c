Manchester United will not allow Wout Weghorst to take the No 7 shirt as his move to the club edges closer. The forward, who is on loan at Besiktas from Burnley, will join the Red Devils on a short-term deal. Weghorst would play back-up to Anthony Martial, but will not wear the No 7 shirt recently vacated by Ronaldo, according to Portuguese outlet A Bola. This is because United chief, Richard Arnold has offered it to Joao Felix in an effort to sweeten any deal. The Atletico Madrid forward remains Unitedâ€™s top target in January. However, negotiations with the LaLiga side are proving difficult, as they demand a hefty loan fee.
