Unknown gunmen suspected to be Eastern Security Network, ESN, militants have attacked the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, office in Imo State, killing one in the process. DAILY POST gathered that the gunmen, who were about 20 in number, operated with two SUVs, one blue-coloured Lexus and an ash-coloured Highlander. Dressed in ESN regalia, the shooters stormed the INEC office at Ahiazu Local Government Secretariat in search of staff distributing Permanent Voter Cards, PVCs. The dead body of the slain guard has been deposited at the morgue. When our correspondent contacted the Imo Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, Henry Okoye, he said he was yet to resume duty but asked to reach the former PPRO, Mike Abatam, who refused to comment on the development.
