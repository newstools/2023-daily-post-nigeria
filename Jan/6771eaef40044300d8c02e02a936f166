Bishop David Oyedepo has cautioned youths against the ‘japa’ Syndrom (leaving Nigeria for greener pastures). The founder of the Living Faith Church better known as Winners Chapel spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday. Oyedepo advised the government to massively invest in citizens to restore the lost esteem of the country. The chancellor said human capital development remains the most viable and stable stock of any nation. Education requires more investment being the bedrock of sustainable national development, the cleric stressed. Oyedepo pointed out that an enabling environment for youths would reduce the number of those leaving Nigeria. He insists relocation is not the best option, noting that many youths are stranded in foreign countries but cannot return because of shame “Parents need to reorientate their children. We all need to stay in Nigeria to rebuild. “Everyone has a part to play in the recovery of his nation”, the preacher added.
