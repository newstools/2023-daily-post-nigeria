The Flying Eagles and the Young Shipolopolo of Zambia will now face off in a single friendly on Saturday, February 4. The friendly will hold at the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja. The two teams were initially scheduled to face each other in two friendlies in Abuja but logistics problems faced by the Zambians have now forced a shift in plans. After the friendly in Abuja, the Young Shipolopolo will proceed to Dakar where they take on Senegal in another friendly next week Tuesday. The Flying Eagles and Shipolopolo will use the friendly to perfect strategies ahead of the 2023 Africa U-20 Cup of Nations to be staged in Egypt. Nigeria will face hosts Egypt, Mozambique and Senegal in Group A. The Zambians are drawn in Group C with Benin Republic, Tunisia and Zambia. The 2023 U-20 AFCON will run from February 19 to March 11.
