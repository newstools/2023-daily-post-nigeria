Nigerian singer, Timi Dakolo has narrated how he was almost deprived of a job by a friend he once considered family. Although he did not reveal the identity of the friend, the ‘Everything’ crooner stated that he was with strangers who suggested him for a job yet she was the only person who tried to go against it. “Imagine a room full of strangers planning an event and suggested me. “And the only person who knows me well inside that room, like knows me kept blocking it,” he said. While recounting the ordeal on his Instagram page, the songwriter disclosed that he was informed about the matter after he was approached by one of the strangers present at the meeting. “Only for one of the strangers to come outside and asked if I have a problem with her. “I said not all, we are Gee’s,” he wrote. He, however, said he got the job but was taught a bitter lesson from the incident. “So I did get the gig because the client insisted. “Anyways we met at sound check. Her first words were ‘Timi this your voice sha”. How is Busola and your amazing kids?!’ “Like me and this person NA Gee. I can even say somewhat family. “Trust me NA, I just smile and said they are fine. “A lesson once learnt is hard to forget, still an unfathomable experience,” he wrote.
