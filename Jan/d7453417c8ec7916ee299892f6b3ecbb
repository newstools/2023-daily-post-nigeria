With 36 days to the election, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar, has been advised against being deceived by empty promises. Earlier on Thursday during the PDP presidential campaign rally in Ibadan, the Governor of Osun State, Ademola Adeleke, boasted that he would deliver his state and the South West in the February 25 presidential election. But a statement jointly signed by Oluremi Omowaiye and Kola Olabisi, chairman and co-chairman of the Media and Digital Communication Directorate, Tinubu-Shettima Presidential Campaign Council, Osun State, has called Adeleke’s wish regarding the general elections in the South West a pipe dream. The statement advised Governor Adeleke to stop daydreaming and halt arrogating to himself the qualities he does not possess. The APC spokespersons noted that: “Adeleke should be told point-blank that his administration is a bundle of disappointment and a source of regret for a handful of voters who fell under his spell and made his pyrrhic victory possible. “As if the insult from the regent Governor Adeleke was not enough, he canvassed to spread the control of the PDP to all the South-West states to enable the people enjoy the dividends of democracy in the manner it is being enjoyed in Osun State.” They also challenged Atiku Abubakar to explain the role he played in the selling of the now moribund Machine Tools and Steel Rolling Mills in Osogbo.
