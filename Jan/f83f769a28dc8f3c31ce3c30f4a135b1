The All Progressive Congress(APC) in Taraba has again put a hold on its presidential campaign in the state. This is the second time in a row that the party is putting off its presidential rally in the state. Though the leadership of the party claimed that the postponement has nothing to do with the ongoing cold war in the party, DAILY POST reliably gathered that the in-house crisis necessitated the delay. Members of the party in the state, have been at loggerheads since the leadership of the party at the national level appointed the Minister of Transportation, Mu’azu Jaji Sambo the state Coordinator for the Presidential Campaign Council (PCC). Emmanuel Bwacha, the Party’s governorship candidate in the state said the “postponement followed the realisation of an error in the date for the rally. He said the APC-PCC, as a matter of policy, does not hold rallies on Fridays and Sundays to respect the religious sensitivity of its members and supporters, asking the Party faithful to be patient and understanding. Some chieftains of the Party who also spoke to DAILY POST identified the various litigations from the party’s governorship primary, as a major reason for the postponement. One of the chieftains who confided in our correspondent said, “we actually want the supreme court to lay to rest the ongoing governorship tussle in our party before embarking on our presidential rally. Believing that the judgement on the case will not exceed this month, he said, as soon as that is done, we will come out with a date for the rally. Some of the Party faithful who also spoke to our correspondent said such delays have begun to dampen the morale of some party supporters. They urged the leadership of the party both at the state and national level to endeavour to put their house in order before coming out with a new date.
