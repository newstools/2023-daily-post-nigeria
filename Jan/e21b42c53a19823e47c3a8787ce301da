Former Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp has labelled Martin Odegaard as a ‘special’ player. He also believes that Arsenal will defeat Tottenham when both sides meet in the Premier League on Sunday. Arsenal will hope to maintain their grip on the top of the Premier League when they meet Spurs in the North London derby. Redknapp said that Arsenal could grab all three points, given their current form and recent form. The former England manager told talkSPORT, “I must admit, this is a fantastic Arsenal team. You have to enjoy watching them play. “The football is just amazing. They play with two great wingers. They have got movement up front. Odegaard, I just think is so special. ” This time they are favourites.”
