The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has accused ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo of alleged hatred against Muslims. The claim came after Obasanjo’s recent endorsement of the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi. DAILY POST reports that the allegation is contained in a statement signed on Friday by MURIC’s director, Professor Ishaq Akintola. The group urged Obasanjo to emulate General Yakubu Gowon (rtd.) and General Abdulsalaam Abubakar (rtd.) in preaching peace instead of dividing the country. It added that nothing should stop Nigerians from voting for any presidential candidate in the forthcoming election, whether Muslim or Christian. “We note with interest the overzealousness exhibited by ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo on the Nigerian political scene. His action is directed towards renewed anti-Muslim campaign as he bays and ululates all over the place, particularly in churches, in his usual rambling manner. “General Yakubu Gowon (rtd.) is preaching unity. General Abdulsalaam Abubakar (rtd.) is preaching peace. But Obasanjo is dividing Nigerians along religious lines. He has no moral authority to blame past leaders when he is not a past follower. It smirks at political charlatanism”, the statement claimed.
