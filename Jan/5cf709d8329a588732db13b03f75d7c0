The All Progressives Congress in Katsina State has called on the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali-Baba to ensure that action is taken against the state governorship candidate for the Peoples Democratic Party, Yakubu Lado for allegedly threatening the life of the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of Kankara Local Government Area, Katsina State. The call is contained in a statement issued on Saturday by Alhaji Sani Ahmed Daura, the State Chairman of the All Progressives Congress. In the statement, Sani alleged that the PDP Governorship candidate, Lado Danmarke was recorded in a phone conversation reigning insults and threat on the Kankara DPO over an attack by his supporters on the motorcade of the APC governorship candidate, Dr. Dikko Umar Radda. The ruling party also blamed Yakubu Lado for the attack on the convoy of the APC guber candidate in his hometown, Danmarke during the party’s campaign tour to the area recently. The Katsina APC State Chairman warned that failure to address the issue may worsen the already challenging security situation in Katsina State as others and may possibly erode public confidence in the Nigerian Police to pave way for thuggery to thrive in the state or even make it ungovernable for unscrupulous politicians to cash on the chaos. The State Chairman of the ruling party also called on the good people of Katsina State to take note of Yakubu Lado’s conduct which is unbecoming of a person aspiring to be the Governor of an elitist state like Katsina.
