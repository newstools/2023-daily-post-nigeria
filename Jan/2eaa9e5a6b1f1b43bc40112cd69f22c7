Arsenal winger Marquinhos is set to join English club Norwich City on loan for the rest of the season. As reported by Evening Standard, the Brazilian is travelling to Norwich on Monday to undergo medicalS and finalise the deal. Arsenal signed Marquinhos in a £3 million deal from Sao Paulo last summer but decided to keep the 19-year-old at the club to help his adjustment to English football. Marquinhos has made six first-team appearances for Mikel Arteta’s side, primarily in their Europa League campaign. However, Marquinhos has now been given a chance to secure regular minutes in the second half of the season. It’s understood that Arsenal has now agreed to send Marquinhos on loan to Norwich until the end of the season while the Championship club do not have an option to permanently buy the Brazilian. Norwich currently sits in the sixth position in the Championship but are 15 points off an automatic promotion place.
