Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu has lauded the Anambra State governor, Charles Soludo for demanding his release from the custody of the Department of State Services, DSS. Aloy Ejimakor, special counsel to Nnamdi Kanu, stated this in a tweet on his official handle on Monday shortly after visiting Kanu at the DSS headquarters, in Abuja. Recall that Governor Soludo had on Saturday, appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari for the release of Kanu, saying he was ready to act as a surety for the secessionist. Reacting, Kanu hailed Soludo for his political courage to make such demand. He wrote: “I just concluded a visitation with #MNK. He directed me to publicly convey his appreciation to Gov. Chukwuma Soludo for the political courage he displayed by demanding for his unconditional release. “On a sad note, he told me that his nutrition and medicals remain erratic.”
