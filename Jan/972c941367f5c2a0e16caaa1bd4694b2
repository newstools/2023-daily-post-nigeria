Ahead of the forthcoming presidential election next month, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Osita Chidoka has said the problems of the youths in the Southern and Northern parts of the country are different, adding that they (northern youths) will vote for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Chidoka also claimed that nobody in the North moved during the EndSars protest because it was not a problem to the people in the North. He made the statement on Sunday while fielding questions on the Channels Television’s Sunday Politics programme. According to the former minister of aviation, there is no national youth movement that could sway votes in the favour of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi. He said, “Let me take something like the youth votes. There are 37 million people between the ages of 18 and 35. Of these 37 million people, nine (9) million of them are in the Northwest, 26%. So there is no national youth movement. 4.1 million of them are in the Southeast 11%. Obi can’t sway those votes. “The issues before the youths in the South and youths in the North are different. So when we were talking about EndSars, nobody in the North moved because this is not a problem for them.”
