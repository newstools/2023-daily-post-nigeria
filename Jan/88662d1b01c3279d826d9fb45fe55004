The Nigerian government has presented a letter of approval to the Amalgamated Union of App-Based Transport Workers of Nigeria (AUATWON). Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige made the presentation on Tuesday in Abuja. The new union comprises all app-based transport workers, online transport services, and e-hailing drivers and operators. Ngige noted that the registration was a milestone in labour administration, particularly in the trade union services segment. The minister said the informal sector, which constitutes the largest population of workers, is being formalised across the world. “Today, we are breaking new ground with those who are employing themselves and from there, employing others”, he said. AUTWON applied for registration on April 27, 2021 to cater for self-employed persons in the field of IT-based transportation services.
