Former Juventus head coach, Andrea Pirlo, is among the shortlist of candidates to replace Roberto Martinez as Belgium manager, according to Italian outlet Tutto Mercato Web. Recall that Martinez took charge of the Belgium national team back in 2016 and remained in the position for six years. The Spaniard recently stepped down from the role following Belgium’s early exit from the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Martinez was appointed as the head coach of the Portugal national team on Monday (today). According to the aforementioned newspaper, Belgium’s football federation will begin interviews with potential contenders this week. They are said to have shortlisted a number of candidates from a wider selection of names. Among the names under consideration for the Belgium job is Pirlo.
