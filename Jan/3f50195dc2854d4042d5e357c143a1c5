Newcastle manager, Eddie Howe, has reacted to claims that Cristiano Ronaldo could join the club if they qualify for the Champions League. There have been reports that Ronaldo has a clause in his Al Nassr contract, that will allow him return to the Premier League and play for the Magpies. Ahead of Tuesday night’s trip to Arsenal, Howe has denied that there is such an agreement. “We wish Cristiano all the best in his venture, but, from our point of view, there’s no truth in that,” Howe said. Ronaldo was officially unveiled by the Saudi Arabia club earlier in the day. According to the 37-year-old, he turned down offers from the US, Brazil and Portugal.
