A social media influencer, Deji Adeyanju, has lamented that he has been abandoned by everyone who claims to be activists like him. Adeyanju said in different posts on Friday that he felt lonely being an activist this time because others in the struggle were now running after politicians for the 2023 elections. He stated that even Omoyele Sowore has abandoned him to pursue his presidential ambition, expressing optimism that they will all return after the election. “It feels so lonely to be an activist right now in Nigeria because everyone has abandoned me in the struggle to follow politicians, but I am optimistic they will return after the elections next month. “I feel so alone in the struggle, even Sowore is running for president; others are working for politicians and hailing them. I can’t wait for the elections to be over next month so that all Nigerian activists can come back to the trenches and leave politicians alone,” he said.
