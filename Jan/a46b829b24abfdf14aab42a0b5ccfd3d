A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Adamu Garba has claimed former President, Olusegun Obasanjo is envious of Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressive Congress, APC. Garba’s statement was contained in a post via his verified Twitter handle on Sunday while reacting to Obasanjo’s endorsement of Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, for the forthcoming presidential election. Recall that Obasanjo had in a lengthy New Year message to Nigerians, endorsed Obi amongst other presidential candidates for the 2023 election, saying he remains a better candidate. However, the endorsement did not sit well with Garba, who took to his Twitter handle to express his displeasure. He wrote, “Envy is an immense disease. I respect & continue to respect General Olusegun Obasanjo. However, I advise him to outgrow his envy of Tinubu at this stage of his life. “Obasanjo is desperately envious of the rise and shine of Bola Ahmed Tinubu; his lost (sic) in this one is sure to come.”
