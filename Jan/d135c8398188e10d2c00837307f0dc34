Nigerian singer, Chukwudi Ken Agali, popularly called Chuddy K, has lost his wife, Racheal to cancer. The singer, while disclosing the sad news on Saturday on his Instagram page, expressed that she fought hard for life. Sharing a photo of his wife, the ‘Gaga Crazy’ hitmaker noted how she fought hard to live, saying he has chosen not to believe the death of his wife. “My queen is gone. I can not believe I’m writing this. I never imagined a day like this would come so early. You fought hard for life. You did not die of cancer. God called you cus he loves you more than I do. RIP Racheal my love.” Recall that Chuddy K, who had in 2022, spoken about his marriage during an interview, acknowledged that staying away from having a second baby mother was a key factor in his decision to get married. ”My first child came to the world through a baby mama, the mother and I got separated later, and he’s caught up in the middle. Your father is in London. Your mother is in America, Uganda, or Germany you are now in the middle of the struggle for your life.”
