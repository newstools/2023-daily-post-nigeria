Borussia Dortmund captain, Marco Reus, has refused to rule out any possibility of following Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo to Al-Nassr in the near future. Reus is the latest European big player to be linked with the Saudi Pro League club following Ronaldo’s signing. Reports had earlier claimed that Al-Nassr are targeting Reus, who could be in line to earn a mouthwatering €20 million per year at the Saudi club. If the German star does so, he will follow in the footsteps of Ronaldo. Reus has less than six months remaining on his current deal with Dortmund. Speaking on the development, the 33-year-old did not dismiss speculation that he could head to the Saudi Pro League and join Ronaldo at Al-Nassr, insisting that he is keen to look ahead. “Of course, you look ahead. I only have six months left on my contract,” Reus told BILD. “I think if you didn’t think about it, that would be wrong too.”
