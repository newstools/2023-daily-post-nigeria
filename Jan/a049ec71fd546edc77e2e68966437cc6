Barcelona manager, Xavi Hernandez has given a reason forward, Memphis Depay left the Blaugrana for Atletico Madrid. Depay recently completed a move to Atletico Madrid after the two La Liga clubs agreed on a €3million deal, with €1million in extras. The Dutchman has signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with Diego Simeone’s side and made his Los Rojiblancos debut in their 3-0 win at Real Valladolid at the weekend. However, Xavi said Depay left Barcelona because the former Lyon forward was not comfortable at Camp Nou. The Spaniard added that Depay asked him personally to sanction an exit from Barcelona. “Memphis asked to leave after he received Atletico’s proposal,” Xavi said as per reports from Marca. “He asked me to leave, he was not comfortable, he wanted to be comfortable again. “We all came out of the situation as winners. “If we can strengthen ourselves, that would be great. If not, it is not urgent. We will see if we can sign someone, but we must remember Financial Fair Play rules.”
