South West rivals, Remo Stars and Shooting Stars will battle for the bragging rights once again when they clash in a Nigeria Premier Football League matchday three encounter in Ikenne on Wednesday. Matches between both teams have been keenly contested, with Remo Stars having a slight advantage. In eight meetings between the two, Remo Stars have won three, with the other five ending in a draw. Remo Stars and Shooting Stars have also enjoyed contrasting fortunes in the NPFL this season. The hosts are unbeaten in the current campaign with two wins from two. Shooting Stars, on the other hand, have drawn their opening two games and are looking for their first win. Current 3SC coach, Gbenga Ogunbote, was in charge of Remo Stars last season and his knowledge of the Sky Blue Stars could be an advantage for his side.
