Manchester United are set to complete their first January transfer signing today. According to the Athletic, Crystal Palace goalkeeper, Jack Butland is set for a medical with Man United today before completing a loan move to Old Trafford for the remainder of the season. The report added that Butland has already agreed to join Man United and will undergo a medical in the north-west later today. Man United have moved quickly to secure a replacement for goalkeeper Martin Dubravka, who was recalled by Newcastle United last week. Butland, whose contract with Crystal Palace will expire at the end of the season, was once tipped to become Englandâ€™s long-term number one but he suffered a devastating ankle injury back in 2016 that kept him out for over a year.
