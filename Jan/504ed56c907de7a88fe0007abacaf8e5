The Supreme Court on Friday in Abuja nullified the primary election of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, which produced Hon Jones Onyerere as its senatorial candidate for Imo West in the February National Assembly election. The Apex Court nullified the primary election on the ground that it was conducted in Owerri, the Imo State capital, instead of Orlu being the senatorial headquarters of Imo West. Justice Emmanuel Agim, in a judgment on the appeal filed by Hon Nnamdi Ezeani, said that PDP grossly violated Section 87 (9) of the Electoral Act by conducting the primary election outside the venue stipulated by law. The Apex Court held that by the judgment, PDP would not participate in the next monthâ€™s senatorial election, having failed to produce its candidate within the time allowed by law. Details later.
