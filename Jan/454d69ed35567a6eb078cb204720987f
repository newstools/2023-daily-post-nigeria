Barely 40 days to next year’s presidential election, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar has said it would be dangerous to vote an inexperienced leader or the All Progressives Congress party. Atiku’s warning is contained in a statement on his verified Twitter handle posted on Monday. He also cautioned that the APC not be voted to power, saying the party was responsible for bringing the country to a sorry situation. “It will be dangerous for Nigeria to relinquish their future to a greenhorn or the national leader of the same party that brought us to this very sorry situation,” Atiku said. The former Vice President might be allegedly referring to the candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi, when he said don’t vote for a greenhorn. The PDP’s presidential candidate has continued to describe Obi as an inexperienced candidate.
