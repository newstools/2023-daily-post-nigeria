Jurgen Klopp has blamed the referee, Stuart Atwell for his side’s 3-1 defeat to Brentford on Monday night. Liverpool were miserable in the first-half at the Community Stadium with an own goal from Ibrahima Konate and a brilliant Yoane Wissa header handing the home side a two-goal lead at the break. Two goals from Brentford were further ruled out by VAR for offside and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored the Reds’ only goal shortly after the break. Then Konate was shoved aside by Bryan Mbeumo in the 84th minute and calmly slotted the ball past Alisson to seal the win for Brentford. “They are extremely physical and in the end nobody knows where the ball is actually, and then it’s an own goal and that’s obviously very unlucky,” he said in his post match interview. Klopp further said “I’m very disappointed” by the second goal of Brentford, adding “that’s the goal I hate the most.” “And the third goal should not be a goal,” the German said, explaining that “If you have ever played football and you are doing a full sprint and you get a slight push you go down because you cannot keep balanced, that’s how it is and you can see it with Ibou [Konate] but Stuart Atwell wanted to see it differently.” Klopp said that talking to the referee about some of his decisions during the game would be “like talking to my microwave,” insisting nothing would come out of it. The German boss lamented that the referee allowed everything to happen during the game. He added, “Before the season, they give us the advice that the players have to be careful at this moment because the refs will have an eye on it and then you see these games and you see that pretty much everything is allowed.”
