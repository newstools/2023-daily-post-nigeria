Real Madrid boss, Carlo Ancelotti, has identified former Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko and former Paris Saint-Germain attacker Mauro Icardi as the players to sign to strengthen his team’s attack. According to El Nacional, Ancelotti wants to bring Dzeko and Icardi to Real Madrid to bolster his attacking options, as Karim Benzema’s campaign has been plagued by injuries. Benzema has played only 19 games for Real Madrid so far this season, scoring 13 goals and registering one assist. Real Madrid also have the likes of Vinicius Jr. and Rodrygo in their ranks. However, there is no direct replacement for Benzema, as Eden Hazard’s poor form has not made things any easier for Ancelotti at Santiago Bernabeu. Hence, Ancelotti is exploring the market to bolster his team’s attack for the remainder of the season. Real Madrid are currently second in La Liga as they look to defend their status as the Spanish champions.
