One of Nigeria’s top media personalities, Omoyeni Anikulapo-Kuti simply identified as Yeni-Kuti has aired her views on one of the world’s most controversial topics, cheating. According to the sexagenerian, cheating, to her, is “not a deal-breaker.” She said that the only deal breaker for her will be finding out that her man, cheats on her with a fellow man stating that, she “will run.” The descendant of the late Afrobeat legend, Fela Anikulapo, made this known via Your View, a programme aired on TVC Nigeria. ”For me, cheating is not a deal breaker. My father had 27 wives, my mother didn’t go; I am not saying she was happy, but she didn’t leave. “My own deal breaker is if I find out my own partner is sleeping with another man. That is my deal breaker. I will run, they wouldn’t even beg me. I will run,” she said.
