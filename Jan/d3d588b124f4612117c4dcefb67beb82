President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed readiness to be present at some of the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential campaign rallies ahead of the February election. Buhari indicated his commitment after the APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu was criticized over his absence at the party’s campaign rallies. A statement by the spokesman of the Tinubu/Shettima campaign, Festus Keyamo, said Buhari would lead APC presidential campaign rallies in Lagos, Imo, Katsina, and seven other states. A timetable released by Keyamo on Thursday listed the state to include: Adamawa on January 9; Yobe State on January 10; Sokoto State on January 16; Kwara State on January 17; Ogun State on January 25; Cross River State on January 30; Nassarawa State on February 4; Katsina State on February 6; Imo State on February 14 and the Grand Finale in Lagos State on February 18. Keyamo appealed to APC members and Tinubu’s supporters to turn out en masse for the upcoming campaign rallies. “The zero hour is nigh; our spirits must be high; we must not relent in this our collective march to our victory that is divinely ordained,” the statement reads.
