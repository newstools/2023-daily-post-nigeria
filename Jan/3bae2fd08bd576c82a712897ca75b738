The Broadcasting Organisation of Nigeria, BON, has said soaring energy costs are affecting the operation and revenue of broadcasters. In a statement on Wednesday, BON said that reduction in the advertising budget of advertisers and non-payment of outstanding debt are militating against the performance of broadcasters. The Executive Secretary of BON, Dr Yemisi Bamgbose, called for government funding to uplift the sector. “It was a year that the National grid collapsed many times, magnifying the epileptic public power supply endemic while bills for the non-available power supply kept rising unabated,” he said. The costs of Premium Motor Spirit, PMS, popularly known as fuel, diesel and others, have hit the roof-top in Nigeria, slowing business performance across sectors.
