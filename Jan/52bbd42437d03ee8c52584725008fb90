Tottenham Hotspur striker, Harry Kane, is “open” to joining Manchester United at the end of the season. United boss, Erik ten Hag, has made the striker his top summer target. Kane was heavily linked with a move to the Red Devils in the summer of 2021, but a move didn’t materialize. United have now revived its interest in the 29-year-old after backing from Ten Hag. The Dutchman is looking for his team’s long-term No. 9, having gotten rid of Cristiano Ronaldo in November. United brought in Burnley striker Wout Weghorst on loan earlier in the month but he is viewed as a stop-gap signing, with United planning to splash out on a new frontman next summer. According to the Daily Mail, the Old Trafford outfit has already started working on a deal for Kane, with sources claiming the Spurs hero would be open to the move. Kane has scored 265 goals in 414 appearances since graduating from Tottenham’s academy in 2011. The England captain will enter the final year of his contract in the summer and Tottenham are not optimistic about their chances of an extension.
