Real Madrid boss, Carlo Ancelotti, is reportedly set to sign another Chelsea star, Raheem Sterling, for Los Blancos. Recall that Ancelotti had signed Antonio Rudiger from Chelsea last summer. According to Fichajes, Ancelotti is eager to improve the right side of his attacking front line and is keen to bring Sterling to Santiago Bernabeu. This is coming less than three two days after Real Madrid’s disappointing Superclasico 3-1 defeat against Barcelona on Sunday in Riyadh. Real Madrid’s latest defeat to Barcelona has now raised alarm bells among the squad, who have had a tough start to the season. Ancelotti’s side have been largely unconvincing since their return to action at the end of December. They currently sit in second position on the La Liga table with three points behind leaders Barcelona.
