A naval rating has been arrested over his alleged complicity in the death of a 16-year-old girl in a hotel in Bayelsa State. The corpse of the deceased, identified as Nengi Enenimiete, was found in November 2022 in the wardrobe of a hotel in Twon Brass, Brass Local Government Area of the state. DAILY POST gathered that Naval Police in conjunction with the operatives of the Nigerian Police and the leadership of youths in the community were able to identify and arrest the naval rating involved in the dastardly act. A source in the community told DAILY POST that the arrested naval rating is in the custody of the Nigerian Navy located at Egweama in Brass Local Government Area and will likely be handed over to the Nigerian Police for prosecution after the internal naval trials.
