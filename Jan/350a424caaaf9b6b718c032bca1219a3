Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN has sympathised with the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria and the entire Catholic faithful in the country on the gruesome murder of Rev. Fr. Isaac Achi. Achi was the Parish Priest of St Peter and Paul Church, Kafin-Koro in Paikoro Local Government Area of Niger State, a few days ago and was buried on Friday. The apex Christian body noted that Achi died at a time the society needed him most. “His death is a sad development at a time his parishioners and by extension other Christians in the country can benefit more from his leadership and sense of direction,” a statement signed by Archbishop Daniel C. Okoh President, Christian Association of Nigeria said. CAN, however, appealed to the authorities to improve internal and external security framework to stop future occurrences of such incidents that led to Fr. Achi’s sudden demise. The Christian body prayed for the soul of the departed to rest in perfect peace.
