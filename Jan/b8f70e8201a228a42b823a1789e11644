The command’s Public Relations Officer, DSC Habeeb Badamasi, said the command also resolved 500 cases through its Peace and Conflict Resolution unit in the state using mediation between farmers and herders through their Agro Rangers unit, which could have resulted in the loss of lives and properties. He explained, “More than 500 cases were resolved through alternative dispute resolution by the PCR unit.” In connection with the railway slippers, he explained that four suspects were arrested and five others were arrested for vandalising electricity armoured cables in the state. The command’s Public Relations Officer stressed that to enhance its activities across the 23 local government areas in the state, the command had opened more area and divisional offices. He added that the Command also trained several officers on weapons handling and deployed officers and men to strategic places and ensured 24-hour patrol across the state within the period under review. As part of the Safe Schools Initiative, he stated that the state Commandant, Mr Yahaya Adah, had deployed a female squad to schools. While in the schools, he assured that the squad would tackle vices among students such as cultism, thuggery, hooliganism, kidnapping, rape, drug addiction, gambling, smoking, and alcoholism, among others.
