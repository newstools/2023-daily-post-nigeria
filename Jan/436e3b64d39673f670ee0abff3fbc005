Manchester United are in talks to sign Wout Weghorst on loan from Burnley. Weghorst, who scored twice against Argentina in the 2022 World Cup, is currently on loan for the season at Besiktas in Turkey. But that could be cut short after he emerged as an option for United boss Erik Ten Hag. United are exploring loan possibilities this month with their January finances limited. Weghorst has scored 10 goals in 20 appearances for club and country this season, including one against Kasimpasa on Saturday. The 6ft 6ins striker waved to supporters as if bidding farewell following his goal. Ten Hag is looking to add to his attacking options after the club cancelled Cristiano Ronaldoâ€™s contract in November.
