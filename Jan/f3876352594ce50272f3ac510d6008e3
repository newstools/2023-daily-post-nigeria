Chelsea legend, Tony Cascarino has named Arsenal as the side in a better position to possibly win the Premier League this season. He believes strongly that Manchester City will drop more points while Arsenal extend their leads by more points. Mikel Arteta’s side are currently on seven points lead over Manchester City in the Premier League table. The Gunners beat Brighton 4-2 on Saturday while Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City drew 1-1 with Everton at home. Cascarino said that things are only set to get harder for Pep Guardiola’s men and better for Arsenal. “Both clubs have got tricky fixtures, but Man City’s now if you go over their next seven games which takes you to mid-February against Arsenal away,” Cascarino told talkSPORT. “Now I know Man City can go on great runs and beat all sorts of teams, but[their next seven opponents] are all driven, they’re all sides that mean they’ll have to be at their very best, I think they’ll drop points over this period.”
