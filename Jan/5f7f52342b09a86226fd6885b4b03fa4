Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State has said no Nigerian should die in pursuit of anybody’s interest in the course of the coming general elections. Fintiri who spoke on Sunday as he joined other dignitaries in the state in laying wreaths at the Mahmud Ribadu Square, Yola, in honour of the nation’s fallen heroes, urged Nigerians to always pray and support the country. Fintiri said: “We should continue to pray for our nation, we should support her to be in peace and support the widows of the fallen heroes who have died and sacrificed their lives in order to keep the nation one and united. “And for us to be together, this election will only serve the country when we are in peace. The life of any Nigerian should not be lost because of an election. You can only rule and enjoy the leadership when we are alive and together.” He appealed to all those who will take part in the conduct of the elections, particularly officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to be mindful of their responsibility and carry out their duties in such a manner that will ensure peace and progress of the country.
