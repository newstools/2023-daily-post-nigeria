Bakyasuwa explained that his committee’s operatives were at the park to arrest some suspected drug barons who supply dangerous drugs to bandits in the State, saying that the committee’s intention was to arrest the principal offenders which they did. He said that the arrest of the drug barons triggered an exchange of fire between his personnel and the hoodlums in the motorpark, which resulted in the death of one person, injuring scores. Speaking further, Bakyasuwa explained that the drug barons were responsible for the political crisis in the State due to the supply of dangerous weapons, drugѕ and other logistics to hoodlums in the State.
