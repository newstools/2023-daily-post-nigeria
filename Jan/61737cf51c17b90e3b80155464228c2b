The All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, has vowed to remove the subsidy on petrol if elected president. Tinubu disclosed this while meeting with business leaders in Lagos State on Friday. The APC flag bearer said funds spent on fuel subsidies would be redirected to public infrastructure, health, and physical policies, among others. He said: “We must remove the PMS subsidy immediately. We will redirect funds to public infrastructure, health, and affordable infrastructure. “Physical policy will be the main driver, we must steadily move out budget from dollar-dominated oil revenue.” Nigeria expends heavily on fuel subsidies yearly, a situation that some economic stakeholders have described as fraudulent. Similarly, the Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate Peter Obi had described fuel subsidy in Nigeria as an organized crime. Obi vowed to remove fuel subsidy if elected president next month.
