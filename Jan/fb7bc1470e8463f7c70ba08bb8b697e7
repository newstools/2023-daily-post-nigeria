Bayern Munich legend Lothar Matthaus has told Borussia Dortmund star Marco Reus to consider joining Cristiano Ronaldo at Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr. Matthaus said he would have moved to Al Nassr if he was the 33-year-old Reus whose contract expires at the end of the 2022-23 campaign. Reus has been a central figure at Dortmund for more than a decade and won five trophies with the German side. He has been speculated to follow Ronaldo to Al-Nassr ahead of the 2023-24 season. And Matthaus told Sky Sports Germany, “I’m not so sure about Marco Reus playing for Borussia Dortmund next season. “Apparently, there is interest from Ronaldo’s new club Al-Nassr from Saudi Arabia. And if this club makes an offer, it will certainly be a financial opportunity that Reus will and must think about. I would if I were him.”
