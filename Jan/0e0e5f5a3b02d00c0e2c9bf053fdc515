Famous Nigerian singer and record producer Michael Collins Ajereh, professionally known as Don Jazzy, has lamented his giving attitude as he expressed fear of going broke if he continues giving out money. While complaining about how he receives calls from strangers who constantly call for financial assistance, the singer said he’s now putting his phone on ‘do not disturb’ mode to avoid some of these strange calls from people. The musician, who took to social media to express shock at learning that unidentified persons were selling his mobile lines, revealed that certain persons are responsible for the constant calls he receives from strangers as they willfully sell his numbers to these people so that they could call him for no reason. “They sell the number, so people will message me for no reason. My phone is forever on ‘Do Not Disturb’ (DND). I know that some people will think that I am cocky or forming, but that is not the point here. “When I’m in a good mood, and I pick some of these calls, they will tell me that they bought the number, but they can’t reveal who sold it to them. “You have to set certain boundaries. Even if I do not want to, my brother (General) tries as much as possible to reduce the number of people that get to me because you can lie any stupid lie, and I will give you the money, but if I continue that way, I can go broke.”
