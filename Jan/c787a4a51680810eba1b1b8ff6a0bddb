Kelechi Iheanacho has revealed how he was able to score the winning goal for Leicester City against Gillingham on Saturday afternoon. Iheanacho’s 56th-minute strike was the difference in a tight contest at the Priestfield Stadium. The 26-year-old finished off a Leicester attack with a sweet left-footed strike. The Nigeria international has struggled for regular playing time at Leicester City this season but proved his class to manager Brendan Rodgers. “It’s just instinct as a striker. People were around the box already so Vardy running at the front post, I was thinking he might cut it back so I just waited around at the edge of the box for the cutback and then it came to me and I finished. I thought he might cut it back and then it was a sweet finish,” Iheanacho told the club’s official website. The forward has now scored 16 goals in 22 games in the Emirates FA Cup.
