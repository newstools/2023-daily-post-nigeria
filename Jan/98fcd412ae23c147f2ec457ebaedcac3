The NCS said the consignments with Duty Paid Value (DPV) of N112.68million were illegally imported. The Comptroller, Ibrahim Muhammad spoke on Wednesday at the command’s port terminal in Port Harcourt. Muhammad said the consignments consist of four containers with 2,965 gallons of oil. Investigation showed the containers were largely vegetable oil concealed in ceramic tiles, and some home appliances. “We know the agents are licenced and customs have control over their operations. A case of seizure has been reported while we await further report,’’ he added. The Comptroller also confirmed the seizure of 481 bales of second-hand clothings, 700 packages of machetes and 107 packages of shovels. Muhammad explained that the machetes and shovels were detained pending provision of an End-user-certificate from Office of the Security Adviser considering the 2023 elections. The command generated N92.32billion in 2022, 12 percent higher than the N81.31billion generated in 2021.
