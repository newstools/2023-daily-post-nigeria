Senator Chimaroke Nnamani explained why he gave his support to Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The lawmaker said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has breached its constitution by destabilizing the principle of power rotation. Nnamani stated this in a statement on Sunday in Abuja. According to him, the PDP’s constitution prescribed that important political offices be rotated between the South and the North to give fairness, equity and justice. Nnamani noted that the outcome of last year’s presidential primaries infuriated southern PDP faithful, including the G5 Governors who insist on respecting the rotation principle of North and South. The statement partly read,” The PDP constitution clearly stated that it shall adhere at all times to the policy of the rotation and zoning of the party and public elective offices in pursuance of the principle of equity, justice and fairness. “In a twist of events and political manoeuvring, Atiku Abubakar got the ticket again. “Having critically examined the situation, I found Bola Tinubu [APC presidential flagbearer] as the preferred candidate from the south to foot the bill in 2023.” DAILY POST reports that Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has been aggrieved with the party’s leadership. They have been calling for the resignation of Iyorchia Ayu as the National Chairman of the PDP.
