Arsenal hero, Emmanuel Petit, believes that Liverpool’s struggles so far this season are mainly down to the sale of forward Sadio Mane. Recall that Mane left Liverpool last summer to join Bayern Munich. Liverpool are currently languishing down in ninth position on the Premier League table with 10 points off the top four following a humiliating 3-0 defeat to Brighton last Saturday. “I have heard many people say that Liverpool’s midfield has struggled this season, and I agree with that to a certain extent,” Petit told ICE 36. “But I think the main reason Liverpool aren’t the same is [Sadio] Mane. “Since Mane left, Liverpool aren’t playing the same way. Mane was such an important link between Liverpool’s midfield and attack. He played with so much energy on the pitch. “He was decisive and always contributed with goals and assists. He added, “There was a big rivalry between [Mohamed]Salah and Mane and they pushed each other, which helped the team. They used to play with a coordinated press, but that is not happening anymore.”
