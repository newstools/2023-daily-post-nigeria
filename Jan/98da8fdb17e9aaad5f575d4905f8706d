The Nigeria Immigration Service, NIS, said it rescued 45 victims of human trafficking in 2022 in Jigawa State. Immigration Public Relations Officer, ASI Nura Usman stated this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, in Dutse on Monday. According to him, personnel of Nigeria Immigration rescued the victims in various operations within the period under review. The victims were intercepted while on their way to Tripoli, Libya, through the Niger Republic and were handed over to the National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons, NAPTIP. According to Usman, the National Immigration Service is conducting enlightenment programmes across the state through the media, and via lectures to National Youth Corps members and local residents on dangers associated with trafficking in persons and illegal migration. While reiterating the readiness of the NIS to scale up sensitisation activities to curb the menace, Usman advised parents not to be hoodwinked by self-seeking elements promising greener pastures abroad. He urged residents of the state to report cases of human trafficking and other related criminal activities to the relevant authorities.
