Former Nigerian President, Olusegun Obasanjo, has said that the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari does not really understand the economy. Obasanjo said this in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital on Thursday, when taking part in an interactive session with the Experiential Leadership in Africa (TEL-Africa). The former president was speaking on his support for the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi. As some Nigerians expressed fuss over his letter endorsing Obi for the 2023 presidential election, Obasanjo reminded them that he did the same for President Buhari, who he said did not really understand the economy. “I have done this in the past before for President Buhari. I said President Buhari does not really understand the economy and that is true and you have seen it. “I wasn’t running him down, that is what he is and he himself will admit that,” he said. Obasanjo also said Buhari’s understanding of foreign affairs was very little. “I said his (Buhari) understanding of foreign affairs is also very little because when he was Military Head of State, he said his frontline does not go beyond the borders of Nigeria. That is a pity!” he stressed. Then, Obasanjo recalled that he wrote an open letter of almost six and a half pages to Buhari, but all to no avail.
