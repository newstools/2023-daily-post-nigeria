Cristiano Ronaldo has sent a message to fans of Al Nassr, as he flies to the Middle East to complete a sensational transfer. The 37-year-old posted himself aboard a private jet on Monday ahead of the trip. Ronaldo has agreed a huge £175m-a-year move to the Saudi Arabian club. Sharing a story to Instagram, Ronaldo said: “Hi guys, see you soon!”. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner left Manchester United in November after his contract was terminated, following a controversial interview with Piers Morgan. He is set to undergo his medicals with Al Nassr on Tuesday ahead of the club’s official unveiling of the Portuguese superstar later that day.
