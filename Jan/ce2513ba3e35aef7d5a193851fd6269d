Famous Nigerian music artiste, Peter Okoye of the P-Square group, has said it’s condemnable to humiliate the office of the president. The singer also said although President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress, APC, didn’t perform well, it does not justify humiliating him. The statement was contained in a post via his verified Twitter handle on Tuesday. Recall that Buhari was recently reported to have been attacked by some residents in Kano State when he went on an official state visit. However, Okoye has condemned the act, saying it was not justifiable. He wrote, “We all agree that President Buhari and the APC have performed badly but we do not subscribe to humiliating the president or office of the president. This is totally condemnable!”
