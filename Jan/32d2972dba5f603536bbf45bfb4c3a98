The Kano State Young Progressive Party (YPP) gubernatorial candidate, Yakubu Uba Muhammad, has defected from the party alongside his running mate to the Action Democratic Party. Uba has dropped his ambition and declared for Ibrahim Shaaban Sharada of the ADP. Uba made this known when he visited the Kano ADP governorship candidate and a member of the House of Representatives for the Municipal Federal Constituency, Sha’aban Ibrahim Sharada, at his office. Uba said he defected to the ADP, with some Federal House of Representatives candidates and state House of Assembly candidates of the YPP vying for the positions in Kano. He informed Sharada that he has already abandoned his YPP governorship ambition, together with his running mate and 24 state executives of the party out of 27, as well as 32 local government structures out of 44. According to him, one of the reasons for his defection and to support Sharada’s ambition was done out of patriotism and to rescue Kano State from maladministration. He said, “We are aware of how the old politicians are retarding the progress of Kano in critical sectors such as education, the plight of pensioners, health, decayed infrastructure, the economic predicament, and encroachment on public properties. Responding, the Kano ADP governorship candidate, Sharada thanked the former YPP governorship candidate for believing in his course to save Kano.. “Our doors are open to every patriotic Kano citizen to join our 2023 Kano project, like the YPP candidate,” said Sharada.
