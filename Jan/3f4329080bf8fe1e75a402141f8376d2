An Anglican Bishop, Rt. Rev. Onyeka Onyia of the Nike Diocese in Enugu State has come under verbal attack after kneeling before Barr. Peter Mbah, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) gubernatorial candidate in the State, during a church service. The video of the incident has surfaced on the internet. The incident reportedly occurred during a thanksgiving service in honour of Venerable Prof. Chinedu Nebo, former minister of power and steel. In the video, Mbah was said to have arrived late during the church service and opted to sit at the rear part of the church. However, the Bishop approached him and pleaded that he relocates to the front row, an offer the governorship candidate declined. With Mbah choosing to remain at the back row, Bishop Onyia went on his knees to make him change his mind. But Mbah, who looked stunned in the video, also went on his knees. A bewildered priest, who appears to be a chaplain to the Bishop and another congregant were seen pulling the Bishop up. DAILY POST reports that the development has not gone down well with many Anglican faithfuls. They are currently venting their anger, with many of them describing the Bishop’s action as a total debasement of the office of a Bishop. Video: Dr. Peter Mbah, the governorship candidate of the PDP in Enugu state displayed an uncommon humility at the church when he came late to service, noticing his arrival, the clergy men approached him for a special seat at the front row, but he declined, instead. #TomorrowIsHere pic.twitter.com/xeebsmae8x — Nwanjoku Ugochukwu (@NwanjokuUgochu3) January 31, 2023
