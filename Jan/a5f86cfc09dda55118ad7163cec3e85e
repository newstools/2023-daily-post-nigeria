Spanish forward, Ayoze Perez is set to leave Leicester City and sign for Villarreal. Spanish outlet Superdeporte report that the former Newcastle United man is heading to the La Liga club. Villarreal’s plan to sign the 29-year-old did not change despite Nicolas Jackson’s failed move to Bournemouth. Jackson was on the verge of joining the Premier League outfit but the move collapsed as medical staff in Bournemouth did not believe he would be able to return from a hamstring injury until March 10. Perez joined Brendan Rodgers’ Foxes Newcastle in 2019 and has scored 15 goals in 114 appearances across all competitions for the King Power landlords.
