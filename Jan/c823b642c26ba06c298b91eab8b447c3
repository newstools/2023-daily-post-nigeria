Governor of Anambra State, Prof. Chukwuma Charles Soludo has called for the immediate and unconditional release of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mr Nnamdi Kanu. Soludo said he was ready to stand as a surety for the secessionist leader, if he is released to him, if the federal government finds it difficult to release him unconditionally. Soludo spoke during the flag off of campaigns of the party, which witnessed the presence of the presidential candidate of the party, Prof Peter Umeadi and other candidates of the party in the state and south east. He said: “I am making a passionate appeal to the Federal Government to release Mazi Nnamdi Kanu unconditionally. If he cannot be released unconditionally, I want him released to me, and I will stand surety for him. “We need Nnamdi Kanu in the roundtable conversation to discuss the insecurity in the South East. We must end insecurity in the South East and we need Nnamdi Kanu to be around. “Sometime ago, we set up the Truth and Reconciliation Committee to find out the root cause of insecurity in the South East and they have almost concluded their assignment. “But this issue of insecurity cannot be well addressed without bringing to the table the key players in this matter. “We have applied the kinetic and non kinetic approach to fighting insecurity in the South East, but the non kinetic approach cannot be complete without the Federal government releasing Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. “We must bring him to the table because we need him to be part of this process and I call on the Federal government to release Nnamdi Kanu to me, for us to have a comprehensive discussion for the fate of the South East. “If we cannot release him based on the court process, I hereby offer myself as the surety for his release and whenever you want him, I will hand him over to you. “We shall provide him shelter and give him home, and we make this plea in the true belief in the spirit of peace in the South East,” he said.
