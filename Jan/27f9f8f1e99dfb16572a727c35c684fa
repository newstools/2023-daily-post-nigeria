Less than two months to the 2023 elections, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has said it would be difficult to rig the polls. Akeredolu said with the introduction of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System, BVAS, rigging would be difficult. He spoke in his office when he received in audience the retiring Resident Electoral Commissioner in the State, Rufus Akeju. The Governor described the introduction of BVAS as a laudable development in Nigeria’s electoral process. Akeredolu applauded the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, for deploying technology to strengthen the electoral process and reinforce confidence. He noted that the introduction of technology has made rigging difficult, adding that it would ensure the All Progressives Congress, APC, will emerge victorious in every election. According to Akeredolu: “I am happy that it’s getting more and more difficult for anybody to influence INEC to rig the election. I have been involved in so many elections, and I keep telling people, the election is difficult to rig. “It has become more difficult now, because whether we like it or not, INEC has improved on its work over time, and I want to congratulate you and the chairman for the good work you are doing.” Akeredolu commended the retiring REC because the State never recorded an inconclusive election during his time in the State.
