Nigeria’s available power generation capacity in the First Quarter of 2022 decreased to 4,712.34MW from 5,465.72MW in the Fourth Quarter of 2021. DAILY POST reports this in a Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission, NERC, First Quarter 2022 Report published on January 6th, 2023. It stated that in the First Quarter of 2022, the average hourly generation
of all available units decreased by 190.58MWh/h (-4.44%) from
4,294.02MWh/h in 2021/Q4 to 4,103.11MWh/h. The commission attributed the decrease to incessant technical faults, gas constraints, as well as undulating load demand patterns that have
continued to affect the amount of energy generated by power plants. NERC added that it is working towards the gradual activation of contracts
to incentives commercial and contractual discipline throughout the value chain. “There were twenty-six (26) grid-connected power stations in 2022/Q1 consisting of nineteen (19) gas, four(4) hydro, two (2) steam, and one (1) gas/steam-powered plants. The plants’ average available generation capacity during the quarter was 4,712.34MW representing a 13.78% decrease (-753.38MW) compared to 5,465.72MW recorded in 2021/Q4”, the report stated.
