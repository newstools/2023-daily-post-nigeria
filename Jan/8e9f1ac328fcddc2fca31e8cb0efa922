Sylva recalled that the nation’s leader issued a similar directive a few months ago. “We have seen a significant improvement, meaning you took the mandate of the president very seriously. “Therefore, Mr President sent us here with a message of commendation to you for your gallantry”, he said. The minister reiterated Buhari’s declaration of total war against those stealing national assets.
