Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand has said Tottenham’s Harry Kane cannot be going anywhere but Old Trafford this summer. The Red Devils are looking to buy a striker to replace Cristiano Ronaldo. However, they want to finalize a six-month loan deal for Burnley striker, Wout Weghorst. But Kane will reportedly be their major target in the next transfer window. Ferdinand, speaking on his Vibe with Five YouTube channel, advised United to break the bank to sign Kane because he guarantees 20 to 25 goals per season. “Man United, if you’re going to go in the summer: let’s go and find a number nine for the next three or four years to hang our hat on, to get 20-25 goals a season every year, where are you going? “You’re going to have to pay big money for Harry Kane. But at least you know you’re getting a man who gets 20-25 goals a season. So Harry Kane can’t be going anywhere but Man United,” Ferdinand said.
