Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Danny Murphy has hailed Arsenal’s backup striker Eddie Nketiah. The former Premier League star is backing Nketiah to score more goals in the Gunners’ colours. He believes that the England centre forward would be more prolific in front of goal than Gabriel Jesus. Nketiah is standing in for Gabriel Jesus who was injured at the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup and will be sidelined for at least 2 months. “I like him. Well, Jesus, before he went away, didn’t score 11. And he’s started three and scored two. “Now, he might not give you the other things Jesus gives you. But I think he’d score more goals in this Arsénal team, because they make chances. And his link-up’s not bad.”
