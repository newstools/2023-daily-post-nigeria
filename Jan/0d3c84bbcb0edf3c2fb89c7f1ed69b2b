The Lagos State Police Command has dismissed social media posts and reports that CP Frank Mba has been appointed CP ahead of the 2023 election. The police disclosed it was inundated with requests for clarification on the status of the Commissioner of Police. Public Relations Officer, SP Benjamin Hundeyin issued a rebuttal on Friday, describing the claims as misinformation. “Commissioner of Police is still CP Abiodun Alabi, or the avoidance of doubt, no Commissioner of Police has been posted to Lagos,” he said. Members of the public were advised to “disregard fake news” of the appointment of a new chief. Hundeyin said the clarification should halt the barrage of calls “which has resulted in needless distraction and waste of valuable time”, adding that residents will be updated whenever the need arises. Frank Mba earlier served as PRO Lagos State Command and later Force Public Relations Officer at the police national headquarters in Abuja. From the position, the senior officer was nominated for a Senior Executive Course at the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS), Kuru. He completed recently. Last April, the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba confirmed CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, also a former PRO in Lagos, as Mba’s successor.
