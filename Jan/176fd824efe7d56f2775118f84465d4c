As part of the activities heralding the arrival of Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, on Wednesday, Ogun State announced the closure of some key roads in Abeokuta, the state capital. Tinubu is expected to campaign at the MKO Abiola International Stadium, Kuto, Abeokuta. Consequently, the Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement, TRACE, has told the public that “there will be traffic rerouting inbound and outbound the stadium axis by 7 am, with the NNPC flyover bridge condoned off for road users and traffic diverted underpass.” A statement by TRACE spokesperson, Babatunde Akinbiyi, informed that “alternative routes and parking spaces will be mapped out and supervised by security and safety officials.” According to Akinbiyi, there will be traffic diversion at NNPC to the right towards Abiola-Way-Leme-Iyana/Mortuary for vehicles coming into Abeokuta from the Sagamu Interchange-Laderin-Okemosan axis. He added that all buses entering Abeokuta through the Sagamu Interchange for the campaign rally would also be diverted at NNPC to the right towards Abiola-Way-Leme Junction to make a U-turn to the left to the stadium through the road opposite Providence Hotel. The TRACE spokesman said, “there will be no access road for vehicles coming from Iyana/Mortuary towards NNPC, except those scheduled for the campaign rally.” Meanwhile, Akinbiyi disclosed that TRACE and other security and safety agencies would be properly positioned to prevent gridlocks on all routes to and fro the stadium, and to man all parking spaces around the stadium premises. Pleading with the public and road users for their understanding and cooperation, he assured that the strategy would minimize delay and ensure effective integrated traffic management along the routes.
