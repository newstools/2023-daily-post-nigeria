Former Manchester United captain, Roy Keane, has questioned the quality of players at Everton. Speaking on ITV after United beat Everton 3-1 in the FA Cup on Friday, Keane said Frank Lampard has “bad players” in his squad. “They have got a lot of bad players, Everton, really bad players. “I look at the group of players. Some of them I’m not even sure are up to Premier League standard, never mind Everton. “So there are huge problems for Frank,” Keane said. Following their exit from the FA Cup, Everton will turn their attention to the Premier League, where they risk being drawn into a relegation fight. Lampard’s men take on fellow strugglers Southampton at home on Saturday, January 14.
