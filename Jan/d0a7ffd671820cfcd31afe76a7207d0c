The Federal Road Safety Corps, FRSC, Ogun Sector Command has warned all political parties against using illegally-branded number plates for the 2023 campaign rallies. The FRSC said it was inundated with reports of such practices among political parties in Ogun State, describing it as a clear contravention of the National Road Traffic Regulations 2012. In a statement by the FRSC spokesperson in Ogun, Florence Okpe, the corps Sector Commander, Ahmed Umar, warned the political parties to “desist from this flagrant and unauthorized use of branded number plates.” This, she said, was pursuant to the primary role of the FRSC in advancing national security through rigorous intelligence gathering linked to its National Vehicle Identification Scheme. Okpe reminded the political parties that there is a procedure for registering vehicles, according to the Presidential Executive Order on the Ease of Doing Business, saying the procedure must be respected. The FRSC maintained that the violation of approved official procedures on the registration of vehicles and the use of illegally acquired number plates are not just a threat to societal order and peace but are also inimical to national security. “Henceforth, FRSC, in collaboration with other relevant security agencies, will not fold their arms and allow this unwholesome practice to go unabated and unpunished. “Therefore anyone found violating this law would be punished accordingly and have his vehicle impounded,” she threatened.
