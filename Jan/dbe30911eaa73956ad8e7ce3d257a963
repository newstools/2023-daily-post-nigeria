Graham Potter has given his verdict on Mykhailo Mudryk’s performance in his debut for Chelsea against Liverpool on Saturday. Chelsea brought in Mudryk from Shakhtar Donetsk for a fee of around £89 million this January. The Ukraine international started the game from the bench in the 55th minute. The winger brought the game to life with a lot of energy, fine runs, good passes and splendid decision-making and was unlucky not to have found the net in his debut. Asked about the 22-year-old’s performance against Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool side, the English manager said, “He’s not played football for a while, he’s been on a mid-season break. “We had to manage his minutes, but you can see his quality.”
