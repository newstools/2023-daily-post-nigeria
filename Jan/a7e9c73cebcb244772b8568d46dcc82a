The Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) said it received information of “plots” by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to unleash fake news “especially in Hausa language” to malign its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. Director, Media and Publicity, Bayo Onanuga in a statement on Sunday, said the campaign considered it necessary to place Nigerians on notice. The APC campaign noted that the “evil plan” was capable of causing disharmony, ill-will and needless crisis with attendant security implications in the country. Onanuga said the PDP and hired influencers have started pushing “nefarious contents by spoofing and using parody social media accounts of popular newspapers and blogs” The ruling party alleged that the main opposition had also recruited many social media actors to carry out the campaign of calumny by proxy. Onanuga said the PDP had arranged a dedicated team working day and night from the PDP national headquarters at Wadata House, Abuja. “We uncovered this evil plot targeted to manipulate Nigerians and most especially Northerners to see Asiwaju Bola Tinubu in bad light,” he noted. The APC mentioned fake accounts such as ‘Vanguard Hausa’, ‘DailyTrust Hausa’ as being used to circulate misinformation on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. The statement added that the accounts and others alike were used by the PDP on Saturday to publish news that trucks carrying old Naira notes belonging to Tinubu were arrested in Lagos.
