Unknown gunmen have kidnapped Mr Kefas Ishaya, the Catechist of St. Monica Catholic Church, Ikulu-Pari, in Chawai Chiefdom of Kauru Local Government, Kaduna State. It was gathered that the gunmen abducted the Catechist when they could not get his boss, Rev Fr Joseph Shekari. According to NAN, Shekari, who was not at his residence when the attack occurred, had travelled out of the village. Chairman of Ikulu Zone of the parish, Mr Sunday Bage, told NAN that the abductors came “around 9.30 p.m. and dragged the Catechist to the bush. ”They took him with his phone. We have been calling the line, but it keeps ringing out.” He said the gunmen shot sporadically, moving through the church, the school and the priest’s residence in search of the Rev Father. Some residents of the area told NAN that the gunmen broke into the priest’s house through the fence. ”They used stones and bullets to break the main door of the house. ”This is devastating; it is a very sad situation. They dragged Catechist on the ground like a dog,” a visibly fear-stricken woman told NAN.
