Ahead of the 2023 general elections, a group known as Fostering Achievement of Community Empowerment (FACE) Initiative, has said it has begun the “Vote Not Fight, Election No Be War” campaign in some areas identified as violence flashpoints in Bayelsa State. Briefing newsmen on Tuesday, at the NUJ Press Centre in Yenagoa, Executive Director, Inatimi Peter Odio, stated there was a need to address the issues of violent conflicts, hate speeches, vote buying and other vices that have characterised the political and electoral processes since Nigeria returned to democracy. He said the sensitisation will be taken to areas prone to electoral violence in the state such as Oporoma community headquarters of Southern Ijaw Local Government Area, Nembe LGA, Ekeremor LGA and Brass LGA. His words “The citizens particularly youth and women need to be awake to their responsibility of nation building through active participation in the electoral process. This group of citizens have remained at the fence for a long time because of voter apathy” All non-governmental organizations, community and faith-based organizations, traditional institutions, youths and women groups should deepen engagement with relevant government agencies in demanding professionalism in the conduct of elections and also intensify sensitization of their constituents on the need to embrace peaceful elections. The BVAS is an innovative game changer in Nigeria’s political process, therefore youth are encouraged to go get their PVCs and go out en-masse to vote for the new Nigeria they desire, and avoid by used by politicians to perpetrate electoral violence. He also called on INEC to ensure they make effective logistic arrangements for staff and mobility for voting materials to enhance election day coordination to prevent potential violence resulting from poor coordination.
