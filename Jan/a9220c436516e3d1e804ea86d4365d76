French Football Federation (FFF) president, Noel Le Graet, has been suspended following his remarks about former Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane. According to Relevo, the FFF have announced that La Graet has been suspended and will be replaced in the interim by current Vice President Philippe Diallo. The report added that an investigation would be conducted by the FFF as to whether Le Graet will continue in his role as president in the wake of his comments. Recall that Le Great’s recent comments regarding Zidane caused outrage among many people in French football. France forward Kylian Mbappe also criticized Le Great’s comment, defending Zidane as a legend. Le Graet had sparked fury when he stated that he “didn’t give a damn” about where Zidane ended up having missed out of France’s coaching job following Didier Deschamps’ renewal. He also insisted that he “wouldn’t pick up the phone” if the Real Madrid legend were to call. Le Graet eventually apologized for his comments about Zidane.
