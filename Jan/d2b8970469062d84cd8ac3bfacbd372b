Manchester United boss, Erik ten Hag, has warned his squad that he will continue to crack down on squad discipline. Last year, Ten Hag axed Cristiano Ronaldo from his squad and eventually approved the termination of the 37-year-old’s contract. Recently, the former Ajax boss dropped Marcus Rashford for turning up late at a team meeting. Youngster Alejandro Garnacho was also punished by ten Hag during the pre-season tour in the summer. “If you want to create a winning attitude and culture, then you have to go this way in my opinion. “Everyone will do it their own way but if you allow them to be ill-disciplined, if you don’t match the standards, values and rules we set together as a team and as staff, if you don’t have that togetherness in the dressing room, then it will come back and blow up in your face,” ten Hag said.
