The leader of the INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has issued a warning to prominent candidates in the 2023 elections. Primate Ayodele disclosed that prominent governors, senators and house of representatives members would die. In a statement signed by his Media Aide, Oluwatosin Osho, the clergyman urged those who are unhealthy to step down from the elections to take care of their health. “My fear in the next election is that Nigeria will lose a prominent person among the governors, senators and rep members they will be voting for. “If you know you are unhealthy, go and take care of yourself, the election is not what you need,” Ayodele said.
