AS Roma manager, Jose Mourinho is reportedly eager to return to England to join his former club, Chelsea next season amid frustration over a lack of financial backing from his current club. Daily Mail reports that an extraordinary third spell at Chelsea would be Mourinho’s ideal scenario and his representatives have let it be known that the Portuguese would be interested in any vacancy at Stamford Bridge. But the Premier League west London club have made it clear they intend to stand by Graham Potter. Mourinho’s wife and children still live in London, and the 60-year-old has always preferred working in the Premier League to elsewhere. Mourinho won the Europa Conference League at Roma last season and they are currently fifth in the Serie A table but lack the resources to fight for the title. The West Ham United job could also be available soon, given David Moyes’ struggles, although Mourinho would not leave Roma during the middle of the season.
