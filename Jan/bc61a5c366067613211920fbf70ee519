The organisations expressed their views during a press conference by the Focal Person of the Coalition of Nigerian Youth Groups, Maximilian Tashilani; the Convener of Coalition of Civil Society For Good Governance, Okpanachi Jacob; and chairman of Arewa Transformational Leaders, Yusuf Ibrahim. They also raised concerns over the voter education carried out by the Independent National Electoral Commission, which, they said, needed to be improved. The CSOs also warned the judiciary against the reckless granting of court orders, injunctions and judgments. He said, “From all indications, President Muhammadu Buhari is not only desirous of bequeathing the legacy of a free and fair election, he is also poised to ensure that all institutions responsible for delivering credible elections are genuinely independent. The organisations expressed their views during a press conference by the Focal Person of the Coalition of Nigerian Youth Groups, Maximilian Tashilani; the Convener of Coalition of Civil Society For Good Governance, Okpanachi Jacob; and chairman of Arewa Transformational Leaders, Yusuf Ibrahim. “The difficulties voters undergo to collect their PVCs are unbearable.
