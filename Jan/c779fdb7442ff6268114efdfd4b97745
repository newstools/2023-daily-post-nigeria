The Osun State High Court in Osogbo, presided by Justice Jide Falola on Monday, sentenced six men to death by hanging for armed robbery and murder. Four among the six men, Rasidi Waidi, 39, Hammed Rafiu, 37, Owolabi Bashiru, 54, and Kayode Sunday, 29, were arraigned on six counts charges for the murder of Victor Akinbile, a cousin of the immediate past Osun Deputy Governor, Benedict Alabi, who travelled down to Ikirun, part of the State on 26 November 2018, to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the past Deputy Governor Alabi, and Governor Gboyega Oyetola. The four gang members who pleaded not guilty before being sentenced were said to have forcefully gained entrance to the victimâ€™s room and demanded a sum of N10 million. After which, he was locked up in the trunk of his Toyota Camry and driven to Osogbo/Ikirun road, where the car was set ablaze. The deceased reportedly gave them some cash and transferred N3 million to an account belonging to one of the assailants before being killed. Also, Justice Falola sentenced Afolabi Mayowa, 35, and Mutiu Azeez, a.k.a. Tompolo, 41, to death for armed robbery and murder. The convicts reportedly killed the commercial motorcyclist they asked to take them to Egbeda and stole the motorcycle. Asides from the sentencing, the Justice also ruled that none of the convicts should benefit from any state pardon due to the gravity of the offence they committed.
