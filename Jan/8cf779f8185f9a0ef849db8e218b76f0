Miracle Op, who appeared to be a Chelsea fan, in a now trending diary session with Big Brother, stunned viewers when he asked about the match result. He said, “I would like to discuss my team, Chelsea. Do you think we won against Liverpool last Saturday, and do you think we would do well for the rest of the season?” Responding to his question, Biggie noted that “Big Brother wouldn’t want to give you a reason to feel ‘Blue’.” Netizens have taken to the comment section to reply. atmacoofficial: ”Who will tell him that Liverpool and Chelsea are now twinnie.” rg_aim: ”I love this guy already very homely.” mr_shon_don: ”Miracle is using the medium to tell Chelsea fans to vote for him. Very smart move.” slimkt9: ”He won’t even see any of the old Chelsea players again when he comes out of the show. He will get to know that the team is now full of new squad.”
