Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has urged Chelsea to give Graham Potter more time to improve his team. Guardiola was speaking after a 4-0 win over the Blues in the FA Cup on Sunday. It is the second in four days that City have beaten Potter’s men. Chelsea have won just one of their last seven matches in all competitions and are 10th in the Premier League. They have also exited both the FA and League Cup, resulting in calls for Potter to be sacked. But Guardiola said: “I’d say to Todd Boehly, give Graham Potter time. Give him time. All the managers need time and he is right. I know at big clubs results are important but give him time. “What he did at Brighton as outstanding, but all the managers need time he is right. “In Barcelona I didn’t need two seasons because I had [Lionel] Messi there.”
