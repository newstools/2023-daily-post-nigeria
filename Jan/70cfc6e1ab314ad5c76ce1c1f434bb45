Amid his face-off with the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has warned those plotting to punish him. Wike warned that those plotting to punish him for insisting on fairness and equity in PDP would lose the election. He spoke during the Rivers PDP Campaign rally on Wednesday in Mogho Town for Gokana Local Government Area. The governor described the perceived threats to deal with him as laughable. According to Wike: “Most of you have watched on YouTube where they said they will deal with me when they win. You can’t win. “You’ve not won; you are threatening to deal with some people. Will God allow you? All of them planning and saying they will deal with us; they’ve not been born. I dare them; let them try it.” Wike has been aggrieved with the PDP leadership since he lost the party’s presidential ticket to Atiku in 2022. Following his loss, Wike and the G-5 group called for the removal of Iyorchia Ayu as PDP’s National Chairman. Wike said Ayu’s removal would ensure fairness and equity within the PDP.
