The Commander-General of the Nigeria Hunter and Forest Security Service, NHFSS, Mr Osatimehin Wole, on Friday advised men and officers of the service not to use their uniforms and arms to intimidate Nigerians but rather, to synergise with other security agencies in detecting and preventing forest crime in line with the agency’s mandate. He gave the advice while inaugurating the Imo State Command Headquarters of the NHFSS in Owerri, on Friday. The Commander-General said the bill for the establishment of the service now awaits President Muhammadu Buhari’s assent. Thanking both chambers of the National Assembly for assenting to the bill for the establishment of the Service, he expressed hope that the President would sign the bill into law within the shortest possible time. “I am happy to inform you that the bill for the establishment of the NHFSS has [scaled] readings of both chambers of the National Assembly and is currently awaiting President Muhammadu Buhari’s assent. “Much as we celebrate this positive development, I wish to remind you that this is a call to service, one that must not be compromised on the altar of ethnicity, family ties or religion,” he said. Speaking, Imo Commander of the NHFSS, Mr Fabian Iwuoha, called for a greater sense of discipline among his men and officers and pledged to keep doing his best to make the command strong. Gov. Hope Uzodinma, who was represented at the event by Imo State Commissioner for Digital Economy, Mr Chimezie Amadi, pledged his continued support for the security outfit and called for greater synergy among security agencies. DAILY POST reports that the event was attended by representatives of the Nigeria Police, Nigeria Correctional Service and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC, in Imo.
