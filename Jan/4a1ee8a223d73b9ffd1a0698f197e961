The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Stanel Group, Dr Stanley Uzochukwu (COA), was at the weekend in Lagos honoured with The Sun’s Investor of the Year Award. The Sun Publishing Limited, the organisers of the event, where men and women who have distinguished themselves as achievers of excellence in their various fields of endeavours were honoured, conferred the award in recognition of the Stanel CEO’s impactful investments in both human and capital development. The 38-year-old businessman who is [an] African youth model of humility, trust and leadership excellence, a few years ago borrowed N150m from his mentor, Dr Cosmos Maduka of Coscharis Group to execute a contract, but today, he has also invested billions in human capital development and also contributed immensely to the Nigerian economy.  Dr Stanley Uzochukwu believes the best way to live a life is to make an impact in people’s lives and society. He prioritises investment in people over buying expensive cars or buildings. Hundreds of widows, orphans, youths and other less privileged individuals have testified to this gesture. In his acceptance remarks, the grateful young man dedicated the award to Maduka and thanked him for being part of his success story. This is why in giving back to society, one of the youngest board members of many private and public institutions is passionately raising men and women via empowerment, job creation and manpower development. He is the convener of the popular youth employment program, Access More With Stanel Master Class in conjunction with Access Bank Plc where over 3, 000 youths are mentored on business start-ups by business leaders. Governors of Rivers, Enugu, Abia, Bayelsa, Adamawa and Taraba were among other eminent Nigerians honoured with The Sun Award on Saturday. Watch him at the event:
