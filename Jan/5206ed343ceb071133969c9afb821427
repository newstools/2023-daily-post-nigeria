Michael Owen has said that any team in the World would have Manchester City’s Riyad Mahrez in their starting XI every week. He said it was embarrassing to see a player like the Algerian sit on the bench but added that it shows the depth in Pep Guardiola’s team. Mahrez came off the bench to score Manchester City’s winning goal in their 1-0 victory over Chelsea in the Premier League on Tuesday night. Mahrez, who has complained about how tough it is starting on the bench for City, made the difference again, cutting Arsenal’s lead in the Premier League to five points. The Algeria International has become a super sub always coming off the bench to score for Pep Guardiola’s side Since joining Manchester City in 2018, Mahrez has scored more Premier League goals as a substitute than any other player. “Any team would do anything to have Mahrez in their starting eleven every single week. “You can bring in £100m off the bench in Jack Grealish but Mahrez off the bench with the goalscoring record in Man City, [it gives you the confidence] as a manager when you have that type of fire power,” Owen said on Premier League Productions.
