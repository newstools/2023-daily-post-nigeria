Lagos State Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Court have sentenced a cleric, Adam Farouk, to life imprisonment for defiling eight pupils aged six and 11 in his class. Justice Soladoye Abiola held that the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt the ingredients of the eight-count charge bordering on sexual assault by penetration brought against the cleric, NAN reports. The justice described the cleric as morally deficient and an embarrassment to the Islamic faith, noting that the evidence of the pupils was corroborated as they identified him as their teacher who penetrated them with his index finger. ”Evidence of the 10th prosecution witness, a midwife with the Women at Risk International Foundation, WARIF, Oluchi Nwoke-Okoi, revealed that the pupils had vaginal injuries. The defendant instructed the pupils to turn their backs while he defiled them with his index finger. “He is meant to teach his students values, morals and discipline, but the reverse was the case. The safety and dignity of our students must be cherished. Dirty Islamic teachers of his kind must be locked away and made to pay for their dirty sexual indiscretions. ”The defendant is hereby convicted of all the charges and sentenced to life imprisonment on each of the eight counts but the sentences will run concurrently.” Also, the judge ordered that the convict have his name written in the Lagos State Sexual Offenders Register.
