British broadcaster, Piers Morgan has provided an update on Al-Nassr forward, Cristiano Ronaldo’s life in Saudi Arabia. Ronaldo’s infamous interview with Morgan triggered his exit from Manchester United last November. The Portugal captain criticized many aspects of Man United, including its owners, manager Erik ten Hag and infrastructure, in the interview. Man United then terminated Ronaldo’s contract by mutual consent in November. Ronaldo has since joined the Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr as a free agent. However, according to Morgan, the 37-year-old is having a grand time in Saudi Arabia. “Definitely (he is happy), I have swapped a few texts with him, and he is absolutely loving it, on and off the pitch,” Morgan told Tatler.
