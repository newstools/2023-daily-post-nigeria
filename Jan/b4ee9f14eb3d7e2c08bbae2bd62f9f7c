The Federal Government has reacted to a viral comment credited to an official of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, that the 2023 general elections face a serious threat of cancellation due to insecurity. Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Information and Culture, stated the position of the Federal Government during the PMB Administration Scorecard Series (2015-2023). The Scorecard Series was launched last October to massively showcase the achievements of the Buhari Administration. “The position of the Federal Government remains that the 2023 elections will be held as planned. Nothing has happened to change that position,” Lai Mohammed said. “We are aware that INEC is working with the security agencies to ensure that the elections are successfully held across the country. “The security agencies have also continued to assure Nigerians that they are working tirelessly to ensure that the elections are held in a peaceful atmosphere. Therefore, there is no cause for alarm.” The Honourable Minister of Health appeared before the press on Tuesday to give his briefing on the strides that have been made in the country’s critical
health sector.
