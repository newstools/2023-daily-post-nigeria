Igbo apex socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has called on governors in the Southeast to support their Anambra counterpart, Prof Chukwuma Soludo in the call for the release of Nnamdi Kanu by the Federal government. Vice President of Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chief Damian Okeke -Ogene, in a press statement released in Awka, said the release of the leader of the indigenous people of Biafra, IPOB, would arrest the unrest in the zone. Okeke-Ogene called on other stakeholders in the zone to also support efforts to release Kanu, and restore stability in Igbo land. He noted that collective efforts of the Governors would help tackle the challenges confronting the region. “We commend Soludo for his strong political will in calling for the unconditional release of the detained Biafra agitator, and volunteering to stand as his surety. “Such decision has further demonstrated his commitment in championing the cause of Ndigbo and protecting the interests of the people, not only in Anambra State, but the entire Southeast zone. “The call should be supported and reechoed by other stakeholders in Igboland as reflected in the stand of late Mbazulike Amechi and late Ohaneze President, Prof George Obiozor. “We call on the governors of the South East to reinforce the call by Soludo. “The Federal government has no legal or moral grounds to still hold the IPOB leader in captivity since court of competent jurisdiction had ordered his release.”
