Delta Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa has denied working against the agitation of the South to produce the next President via the 2023 election. The vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) spoke on Monday through Chief Press Secretary Olisa Ifeajika. Ifeajika told reporters in Asaba that Okowa honoured PDP’s decisions concerning the presidential convention. After a meeting in Asaba, Lagos and Enugu, the Southern Governors’ Forum agreed to work towards the realisation of a southern presidency. Ifeajika noted that when they returned to their various parties, decisions varied regarding electing a candidate. The spokesperson said in the PDP, the party made it clear to the governors that it may not go with their position. He recalled that the matter brought about a committee headed by Benue Governor, Samuel Ortom, to advise appropriately on the zoning of the ticket. The committee recommended that zoning be jettisoned to allow all aspirants to participate in the primary. “As far as we are aware, no member, including the governors or group, protested the party’s decision. They accepted the party’s decision on zoning. “There was no treachery anywhere because no agreement was reached. The party’s position prevailed and delegates at the primary voted as they wished”, Ifeajika said.
