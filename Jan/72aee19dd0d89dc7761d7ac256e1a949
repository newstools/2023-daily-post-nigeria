Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has suggested that his team defeated Manchester United 3-2 in Sunday’s Premier League tie because his players were ready for the visitors emotionally. According to Arteta, Arsenal were also in control of the game against Man United. A brace from Nketiah and a goal from Bukayo Saka gave Arteta’s side the victory over the Red Devils. Marcus Rashford and Lisandro Martinez did score for Erik ten Hag’s side. Speaking at his post-match press conference after the game, Arteta said, “Going down straight away against this team is dangerous. We came back 2-1 and it was exactly what happened at OT. “We were in control and they scored. It was a moment where if emotionally you are not ready, you are going to lose it.”
