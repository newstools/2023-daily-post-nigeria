The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State has refuted claims making the rounds that some prominent members of the party dumped it for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. A press statement signed and issued to newsmen in Gusau, by the State APC publicity scribe, Mallam Yusuf Idris Gusau said the report is completely misleading and a desperate move by both the PDP and the defectors to build a fake image and perhaps make some money. “It will be good to clear the minds of Nigerians that Zamfara State people are well informed about who those imposters are” “One of the impostors and purported ZASIEC chairman, Garba Muhammad Danburan Gusau, was a chairman of the commission who served two terms and left, now a new chairman, Isah Umar has been appointed and has since been in place” “Surprisingly too, the three persons who deceptively posed as advisers, Alhaji Hamisu Magami, Alhaji Abubakar Maigandi and Alhaji Yunusa Lawal Rosy only served as advisers under the immediate past administration of Alhaji Abdulaziz Yari Abubakar with no significant roles in the present leadership of Governor Matawalle” Yusuf said the APC has continued to receive serving and former leaders of the PDP and has always mentioned the positions they held or were holding including candidates who were cleared to contest responsible positions in the 2023 general elections without lying to the people of the state. “It certainty amounts to cowardice, mischief, misinformation, lies and deception for one to claim what one isn’t, even if he or she had been there just to score a false political point” “It is high time the opposition PDP realizes that no amount of such bad attitude will bring down the APC which holds nothing against the PDP” “Members of the PDP should rather go and meet the electorate and campaign because smearing the APC through social media will not and cannot bring votes to them” “We wish to again call on our members and supporters to as usual dismiss such gimmicks by the PDP as we continue to make our dear state better”
