Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Godwin Emefiele has resumed duty after his annual vacation abroad. Emefiele, who proceeded on leave in December 2022, resumed work today, January 16. A statement by Osita Nwanisobi, Director of Corporate Communications, confirmed the resumption. The spokesperson noted that the governor is back to work “with renewed vigour”. Emefiele will on January 23 and 24 chair the first Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting of the year. “Mr Emefiele remains committed to performing the task before him in line with his oath of office and the policy direction of President Muhammadu Buhari,” Nwanisobi noted. The CBN thanked the public for keeping faith with the apex bank and urged Nigerians to continue to support its policies. Emefiele is in the eye of the storm as he faces probe by the Department of State Services, DSS, for alleged terrorism financing, fraud and funds diversion. On Monday, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, SAN, challenged the DSS to file the charges in court.
