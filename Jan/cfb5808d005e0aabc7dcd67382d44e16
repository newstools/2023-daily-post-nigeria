Ogbese Community in Akure North Local Government Area of Ondo State was on Wednesday in turmoil, following a brutal clash between Fulani and Hausa settlers in the community. One person was said to have died in the crisis with many people injured and properties destroyed. It was gathered that the conflict, which had begun on Tuesday evening, escalated by Wednesday morning, when a number of stores belonging to the northerners were set ablaze in the popular market of the community. At the time this report was filed, the exact reason behind the altercation was still unknown, but it was discovered that the neighbourhood was under palpable tension. However, a community member claimed that the conflict stemmed from an altercation between a Fulani man who lived in the forest and a Hausa man residing in the neighbourhood over Cannabis sativa, also known as Indian hemp. According to him, the Fulani man allegedly stole from a pack of cannabis kept in the bush owned by the Hausa man. The police spokesperson, Funmilayo Odunlami, confirmed that eight shops were razed but denied the report of an ethnic crisis.
