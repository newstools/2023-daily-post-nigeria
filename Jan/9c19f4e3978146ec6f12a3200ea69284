The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has said he doesn’t get angry when he faces betrayal. Tinubu made this remark at a town hall meeting in Edo State, according to a statement released by his media aide, Tunde Rahman, on Sunday. The former Lagos State Governor also criticised the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar and urged the people of Edo State to take their State back from the PDP. Tinubu said: “We must rescue Edo State. I am ready to work with you. Take lanterns, go from house to house. “Don’t get angry; anger does not solve problems. Disappointment is an energizer for me. You disappoint me, I work harder. You betray me, I don’t get angry; I ignore you. “The reason is because you are not my God and you are not my creator.”
