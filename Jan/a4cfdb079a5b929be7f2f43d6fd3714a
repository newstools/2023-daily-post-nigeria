A close aide to the former military president, Gen Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, Salman Yusuf has advised Nigerians to ignore fraudsters using IBB’s name on social media to send wrong information. Yusuf who gave the advice in Minna said the elder statesman does not operate any social media account, especially Facebook and therefore, cannot send messages on any social media platform. He explained that the Facebook account being used bearing IBB’s name and picture is fake and created by identity thieves and cyber fraudsters, both local and international to defraud, misinform and commit heinous crimes against Nigerians and foreigners alike. The aide stated: “Our attention has been drawn to a plethora of fake social media accounts, especially Facebook, bearing General Babangida’s names and photos. We wish to state that IBB has never owned nor operated any social media account, and he does not intend to operate any now or in the near future.” He argued that the former military president does not comment on national issues on social media because he has unfettered access to several credible mainstream media that he can talk to whenever he feels strongly on any matter. Yusuf insisted: “It is absolutely unnecessary because there are official channels available to him to communicate his stand on any national issue to the authorities.” He implored the public to ignore the antics of cyber criminals “who do not mean well for our great country.” Speaking further he said: ” We urge Nigerians to get involved in the democratic process, conduct themselves peacefully, and exercise their constitutional rights by voting for candidates of their choice in the coming general elections.”
