Confirming the incident on Friday, Bauchi State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Ahmed Wakil in a statement said trouble started when the man’s two wives had a misunderstanding which their husband tried to settle to no avail. The senior wife’s son had threatened to attack his father and as a precaution, the man slept with his Dane gun beside his bed at night. The statement affirmed: “There was an altercation between the wives, to the extent that the eldest son holds grudges against the father and threatened to harm him. This made the suspect load his Dane gun and kept it beside him throughout the night waiting for an intruder, possibly his eldest son.” On December 28, 2022, Usman slept in the same room with his second wife but was not aware when she stepped out of the room at 2 am to urinate.

She was rushed to the General Hospital Burra but certified Dead-on-Arrival by the doctor. According to the statement, the suspect has been arrested and would be charged to court after the completion of investigations.
