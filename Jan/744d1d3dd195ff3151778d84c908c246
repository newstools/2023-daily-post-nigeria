Highway tanker drivers, on Saturday, reopened the Zaria-Kano Federal road. DAILY POST recalls that tanker drivers had blocked the Zaria-Kano road protesting alleged killing of their member. However, on Saturday morning, the protesting drivers agreed to reopen the road following series of negotiations with security agents. The State Acting Sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps, Lawal Garba, who confirmed the development, said normalcy had since returned. “I’m happy to inform you this morning that the Zaria-Kano Highway was reopened around 9:30am today after days of blockage. “Traffic flow is smooth as the road is fully open. Personnel of the Command are in traffic control,” he said.
