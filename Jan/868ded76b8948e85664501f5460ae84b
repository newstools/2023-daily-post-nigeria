The scarcity of Premium Motor Spirit, popularly known as petrol across the country, had in the last 24 hours taken a new twist in Ondo State as fuel stations dispensed the product at N500 per litre within Akure metropolis while motorists buy at the black market price of N1, 000 per litre in the Shasha -NEPA axis of the state capital. Despite the hike in price, there were endless queues at filling stations where motorists and commercial motorcyclists struggled to get the products. At a filling station around Shasha market, where vehicle owners had queued as early as 5 am, motorists could be heard expressing anger over the situation. “This is just not acceptable anymore. At N500 and we are still struggling like this? We don’t know who will save us again because Nigerians are just fed up,” a driver vented his frustration. Meanwhile, vehicular traffic on the roads in the city was scanty due to the scarcity of fuel.
