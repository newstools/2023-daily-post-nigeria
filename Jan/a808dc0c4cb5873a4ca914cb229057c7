Former Liverpool winger, Jermaine Pennant, has warned West Ham United against appointing former Chelsea manager, Rafael Benitez, as their next coach. Pennant said that Benitez, linked with a move to West Ham United, is the worst man-manager. The 40-year-old, who played under Benitez for three seasons at Liverpool, warned the Hammers about Benitez’s particular trait. According to him, Benitez is not the type of manager West Ham need. “Don’t get him in your club, I just don’t think he is what they need. For me, he is probably the worst man-manager that I have come across. You don’t need that,” Pennant told talkSPORT. “I could have played a game, scored a hat-trick, got Man of the Match and Rafa probably would have pulled me in and said; ‘You could have done this a bit better’. I don’t think the West Ham boys – especially with the time they are in – would do well under Rafa. So you stick with Moysey.” West Ham are currently in the relegation zone of the Premier League table. They’re in 18th on the log with 15 points after 19 league matches.
