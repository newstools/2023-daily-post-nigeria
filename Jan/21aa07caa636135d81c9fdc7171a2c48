PSG manager Christophe Galtier has confirmed that talks are ongoing between the club and Chelsea for Hakim Ziyech. TalkSPORT understands that Blues forward Ziyech wants to leave Stamford Bridge after failing to hold down a regular starting place. Now Galtier has confirmed that the move is in the pipeline. He said: “We’re working on the Hakim Ziyech deal, it’s true and talks are ongoing — I don’t want to say more as he’s a Chelsea player.” Meanwhile, talkSPORT football journalist Dan Windle has said that confidence is dying on Chelsea’s move for Enzo Fernandez. Chelsea are ready to break the bank to bring the Benfica midfielder to Stamford Bridge before 11 pm today. “There is still no movement,” he said. “The total fee for Fernandez could be £115m with bonuses.” “But confidence is drying up as the time ticks by towards the deadline.”
