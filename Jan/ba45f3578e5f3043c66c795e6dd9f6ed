All Progressives Congress (APC) Youth Leader, Dayo Israel said the fuel scarcity across the country is planned. In a Twitter post on Thursday, he called the non-availability of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) an internal sabotage. Israel noted that Nigerians enjoyed an adequate supply of petrol in the last seven years of the current administration. “We have always had fuel availability every Christmas. It was even a major scorecard that the December fuel crisis came to end. “How come the December before the election, suddenly fuel became scarce, reason am! To make APC look bad to Nigerians? INTERNAL SABOTEURS,” he tweeted. Israel’s comment supports Bola Tinubu’s position that the fuel scarcity and naira redesign were deliberate and targeted at him. Tinubu attacked President Muhammadu Buhari’s government on Wednesday at a campaign rally in Abeokuta, Ogun State. “They are cleverly creating fuel scarcity. Let the fuel continue to be scarce, they know where they hoard it,” the APC presidential candidate said. In response, the Atiku Campaign Organization told Tinubu to stop playing the victim card as he has been part of the government since 2015. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) also mocked the former Lagos governor for accusing Buhari and some party leaders of trying to scuttle his ambition.
