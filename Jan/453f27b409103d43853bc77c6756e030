The Alake and Paramount Ruler of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Aremu Gbadebo, has predicted what will happen in Nigeria after the 2023 general elections. The monarch spoke Monday in Abeokuta at an event organised in honour of Dr Gbenga Adeoye, who was recently called to bar. Oba Gbadebo had predicted that “the hardships of the previous years would be wiped off in 2023,” asking Nigerians to have faith in God. He expressed confidence that the year 2023 will be a great one for Ogun State and the country at large. However, the Alake asked Nigerians to pray for peaceful elections as Nigerians elect new leaders in February and March. He charged the people to play their parts by collecting their voters’ cards to vote wisely during the elections. In his words, the Accountant-turned Lawyer also predicted that “the 2023 elections will reshape the country.” According to him, Nigeria would be given a new name in the comity of nations after the 2023 polls. Adeoye, therefore, urged the people to shun political violence, charging all Nigerians to vote massively for their respective candidates. He emphasised that, after the elections, it must be the collective responsibility of all Nigerians to solve the nation’s problems and promote its development, saying no one should sit on the fence.
