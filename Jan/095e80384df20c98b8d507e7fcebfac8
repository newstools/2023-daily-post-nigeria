Chelsea manager, Graham Potter has vowed to “keep working” following their 2-1 defeat at Fulham on Thursday night. It was the latest in a long line of bad results for Potter. The Blues have failed to win any of their first four matches of 2023. Potter introduced loan signing Joao Felix into his starting XI against Fulham, in desperate need of inspiration. But it was former Blues midfielder Willian who opened the scoring, before Kalidou Koulibaly equalized early in the second half. Felix was then sent off for a late challenge on Kenny Tete and Carlos Vinicius grabbed the winner against the 10 men. The result leaves Potter’s men in 10th position, 10 points adrift of Champions League spots. Potter told BT Sport: “I think we controlled the game early, won the ball back high, created some opportunities – maybe missed the last pass. We made a couple of mistakes for their goal. “Second half, I think we responded well and then the red card changed the game. Makes it a little more difficult for us. I thought the application when we went down to 10 was really good.”
