Terrorists ambushed and killed security operatives in communities of Brinin-Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State on Sunday. The security operatives included members of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC; police, soldiers and local vigilantes. Abublaakar Kakangi, a community leader, explained that the incident happened in Kubau and Unguwan Zakara villages. According to him, the bandits had an agreement with the communities where they allowed the locals to farm throughout the last farming season. He explained that the bandits usually passed through the villages to sell stolen cows which the security operatives were not happy about. He added that about three weeks ago, the operatives had killed a boy looking after the cattle, which infuriated the bandits. “On Sunday, the bandits stormed Aka security checkpoint along Birnin-Gwari to Kakangi/Randagi road of the western part of Birnin-Gwari LGA,” he explained. He stated that the attack occurred around 2:00 pm as the bandits divided themselves into two groups and simultaneously attacked the two villages where they killed the security operatives. He said that the corpses of the dead were deposited at a Kaduna hospital before their burial. The police are yet to react to the incident, but the spokesman of the Kaduna Command of the NSCDC promised to issue a statement later.
