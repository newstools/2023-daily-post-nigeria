With less than two months to the presidential election, Nigerians have been cautioned against voting for people along religious lines, saying God has no business with Nigerian thieving politicians. Deji Adeyanju, a socio-political activist, gave the admonition while noting that God has no plans with Nigeria’s thieving politicians. Adeyanju was condemning an Islamic preacher, Abdulmutallab Mohammed Auwal, for urging Muslims to consider the All Progressives Congress, APC, and its Muslim/Muslim ticket as a call to Jihad. At a special prayer session organised by Muslim clerics in Kano for the success of Bola Tinubu’s candidacy, Auwal said the Tinubu/Shettima’s Muslim/Muslim ticket had defined the supremacy of Islam. Reacting, Adeyanju said the cleric’s remark was not different from pastors endorsing a particular candidate as God’s will. In a chat with DAILY POST, Adeyanju wrote: “Nigerians must reject the urge to vote for people along religious and ethnic lines. “I condemn the remarks of the Islamic cleric in Kano calling on Muslims to vote for Tinubu/Shettima by referring to their ticket as a jihad. “His remarks are not different from that of pastors endorsing a candidate and saying he is God’s will for Nigeria. God has no business with Nigerian thieving politicians.”
