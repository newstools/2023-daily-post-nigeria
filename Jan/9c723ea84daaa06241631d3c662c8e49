Saudi Arabia is reportedly set to twist its marriage law to allow Al Nassr’s new signing, Cristiano Ronaldo, to live with his partner, Georgina Rodriguez in the country, according to Spanish news outlet Sport. Saudi Arabia’s marriage law prohibits couples that are not married from living together. The report added that Ronaldo and Rodriguez will be living together in Saudi Arabia and are most likely not going to be punished for breaking the law. Ronaldo recently signed for Al-Nassr after his contract with Manchester United was terminated in November.
The Portugal captain signed a contract with the Saudi Arabian outfit that would see him remain at the club until 2025. The 37-year-old was officially unveiled as an Al-Nassr player this week. Upon joining the club, Ronaldo promised to help not only develop the sport in Al-Nassr but Saudi Arabia as a nation.
