The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) has commenced a manhunt for a young man who shared a substance with an infant. A viral video, recorded by another individual in the room, shows the culprit giving suspected marijuana to a baby girl. The video sparked anger as Nigerians charged the police and Nigeria Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) to find and prosecute the duo. Force Public Relations Officer, CSP Muyiwa Adejobi urged Nigerians with information about them to contact the police. The spokesman lamented the level of social decadence, advising mothers and guardians to be wary of those they leave their babies with. “Until we arrest them, we won’t know what actually happened. The mother might not be there. “I gave an analogy that it might be the mother’s sister who even took the baby to visit her boyfriend. “He must be caused to face the wrath of the law. This is too bad. But above all, mothers must learn from this”, Adejobi said. Adejobi added that every problem in Nigeria is tailored to one societal issue or the other and if addressed, the “general problems” would be “80% solved”.
