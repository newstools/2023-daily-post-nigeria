The Minister of Mining and Steel Development, Lekan Adegbite, has said that it is impossible to preempt illegal mining activities in Nigeria due to its vast space. Adegbite made this disclosure on Tuesday in an AriseTV interview monitored by DAILY POST. Reacting to the sector’s activities recently, the minister disclosed that the current administration is doing enough to de-risk the industry to attract foreign investors. “It is impossible to preempt illegal miners in Nigeria. Look how it is; you cannot be in anybody’s mind; somebody decides to go tomorrow to a forest in Taraba and start doing illegal activities, either mining or otherwise; there is no way you can preempt that. But we are alive to that responsibility to monitor the sector because we have a satellite monitoring system in the Ministry, where we see illegal mining activities, and we react promptly,” he said.
