Erik ten Hag will approve the sale of Manchester United right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka despite the player’s upturn in form shown by the player lately. Wan-Bissaka has made two starts in the Premier League lately due to Diogo Dalot’s injury. The English full-back, however, impressed in those games which made it his four appearances across competitions this season, contributing an assist. The England left-back put in convincing displays, showing his defensive nous while also helping United in United’s transition. But despite this, Ten Hag is said not to be a fan of the defender and The Athletic reports that several clubs are interested in signing him this month. Wan-Bissaka joined Manchester United from Crystal Palace in 2019 for £50 million. He became the first-choice right-back under former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. However, he has fallen down the pecking order as time has progressed and has been displaced by Dalot in the Red Devils’ starting lineup.
