The gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Plateau State, Barr. Caleb Mutfwang said the mandate of Plateau people would be used adequately to revamp the state’s dwindling economy rather than witch-hunting individuals if elected in the 2023 polls. He equally said the presidential candidate of the party, Atiku Abubakar will come on board with a robust experience to tackle insecurity in the country within the context of the State for the greater good of the citizenry. Mutfwang made the disclosure during a courtesy call on the leadership of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Plateau Council, led by Comrade Paul Jatau. He said, “We are not coming in to witch-hunt, we will not waste the precious mandate of our people on witch-hunting, if there is any tradition of witch-hunt on the Plateau, we will break it. “But be rest assured that we will reform government processes and in the course of our reforms; if we find out that wrongs have been done, we will ensure that not only the opportunity to do wrong is blocked, but that people should be able to correct the mistakes they have done in the past.” Mutfwang reiterated his commitment to providing credible and competent leadership that will carry along Plateau youths with a view to create greater opportunities in government for them to bring to bear their talents. “Let me say this clearly without equivocation, we are going to give great opportunities to our youths to adequately participate in the governance process and to be properly mentored. “For me, the youths are not the next generation, they are the generation of now and I believe when we interact with them, they will see the benefits of what we will pass unto them to enable them move with the future of our state. “We will give the youths adequate space to bring their skills to bear”, he assured.
