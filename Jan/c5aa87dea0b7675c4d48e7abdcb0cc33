Ligue 1 club, Stade de Reims are interested in Super Eagles goalkeeper, Francis Uzoho, according to reports. The Nigeria international still has a year and six months left on his contract with Cypriot club, Omonia Nicosia but is open to the move. Uzoho received huge plaudits for his performance in Omonia Nicosia’s UEFA Europa League clash against Manchester United last October. The 24-year has also played for Cypriot clubs, Anorthosis Famagusta and APOEL. The former Deportivo La Coruna goalkeeper was Nigeria’s first-choice goalkeeper at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. It remains to be seen if Omonia Nicosia will allow him to leave in the current window following his impressive display for the club in recent outings.
