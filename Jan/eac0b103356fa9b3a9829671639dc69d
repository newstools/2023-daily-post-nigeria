The convoy of the deputy governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State, Adekunle Akinlade, was reportedly attacked on Thursday. DAILY POST learnt that the convoy was attacked while the PDP supporters were returning from their campaign rally in Igbesa, Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government Area of Ogun State. Confirming the attack, Akinlade’s media aide, Azeez Adelani, said “the side glass of the vehicle the Deputy Gubernatorial candidate, Hon. Adekunle Akinlade was traveling in was smashed.” According to him, other branded vehicles were damaged, while some supporters sustained various degree of injuries. Adelani blamed the attack on some thugs he said were members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). He said the thugs “laid ambush and attacked vehicles and PDP supporters after their Igbesa rally.” However, Adelani maintained that Akinlade was not perturbed by the incident as he said “no amount of intimidation or provocation will distract him or the PDP from seeing what he described as ‘God’s project’ through.” While expressing confidence that the PDP would win the general elections, Akinlade called on party members to be patient and steadfast. Meanwhile, the PDP in Ogun State has called on security agencies to provide more protection for residents, regardless of their political affiliations, seeking investigation into the attack.
