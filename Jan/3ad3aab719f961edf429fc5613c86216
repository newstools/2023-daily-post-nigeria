Al-Nassr president, Musalli Al-Muammar, has urged the club’s players to learn and replicate new signing Cristiano Ronaldo’s attitude. Al-Muammar also heaped praise on Ronaldo, branding him as the greatest player of all time. Ronaldo joined Al-Nassr on a free transfer last Friday, signing a contract that will see him remain at the Saudi Arabia club until 2025. This comes after Ronaldo’s contract with Manchester United was terminated last November by mutual consent. The Portugal captain had his first press conference on Tuesday evening after he was officially unveiled as an Al-Nassr player. “He [Cristiano Ronaldo] is the greatest player of all time,” Al-Muammar said (via GOAL). “We hope players learn from him and replicate his attitude.”
