New Manchester United signing, Wout Weghorst has promised to give ‘everything’ to the Red Devils after completing a January loan move to Old Trafford. Weghorst, who featured for the Netherlands at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, joined Man United from Burnley on loan for the end of the season. The 30-year-old was on loan at Besiktas but requested to leave the Turkish side in order to complete a move to Manchester United. Speaking after completing his move to Man United, Weghorst told the club’s website: “I feel privileged to be joining Manchester United. “I have seen United’s progress under Erik ten Hag this season and can’t wait to start playing my part in pushing the team towards its aims. “Whatever happens in the next few months, I can promise to give everything to the club for as long as I am here. “I thank everyone who has played a part in getting me to this stage, and now I’m looking forward to meeting my new teammates and getting involved straight away.”
