Former Napoli player, Raffaele Ametrano, has named Victor Osimhen as the strongest centre-forward in the Serie A. Ametrano said this while speaking on Radio CRC ahead of Napoli’s Serie A clash with Juventus on Friday night. Speaking on Napoli’s chances against Juventus, Ametrano said, “In front, they have the strongest centre forward in our league, Victor Osimhen. “He’s a player who tires you to such an extent that you lose the decisive meter.” He added, “even in yesterday’s goal, he had a 10/15 meter dash ahead of the defender. It is not easy to mark Osimhen.” Osimhen has scored ten goals in 13 Serie A matches for Napoli this season.
