The federal government has disclosed that it trained one hundred youths in Maiduguri, Borno State, on modern vulcanizing services. The Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive of the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure, NASENI, Prof Mohammed Haruna made this disclosure in a statement by the commission’s Deputy Director, Information, Mr Olusegun Ayeoyenikan, on Monday. Mohammed said the commission has been focusing on the modern method of vulcanizing and capacity building by using modern equipment in the vocation. He says, “the training will expose the beneficiaries to new skill sets that will require them to make a fortune and maintain a competitive edge in the vulcanizing business. The trainees will become a new set of vulcanizing technicians who can provide modern vehicles with more electronic components and innovative technologies compared to manual-based vehicles. On his part, the Executive Governor of Borno State, Engr. Prof Babagana Umara Zulum said the state needs innovation skills to develop it. Zulum, represented by the Acting Borno State Head of Service, Barrister Mallum Fanami, stated, “City like Maiduguri where there is a high number of vehicles. A person with a vocation related to the maintenance of car services ought to be in business because car owners always require their services to keep the vehicles on the road. “Therefore, vulcanizing, the focus of this special training, is a highly sought-after vocation in car vehicle maintenance services. But the challenge has been the low level of technology adaptation and lack of use of modern equipment in fixing tires either for repairs of punctured tires or outright replacement”, he stated.
