Nottingham Forest manager, Steve Cooper has confirmed that the club will assess the fitness of Taiwo Awoniyi ahead of Saturday’s FA Cup tie against Sky Bet Championship club, Blackpool. Awoniyi limped off the pitch in the 70th minute of Nottingham Forest’s 1-0 win against Southampton at the St Mary’s Stadium on Wednesday night. The Nigeria international scored the all-important goal in the encounter. The 24-year-old is the Reds top scorer with four goals in 17 league appearances. Cooper will no doubt want his star striker to be available for the trip to Bloomfield Road. “It’s still early. We’re still assessing. The players are in a bit later today,” Cooper was quoted by Nottingham Post. “A couple of the lads walked off yesterday with some fatigue. We’ll have to look at Taiwo, for example, and see how he is. It’s too soon, really, to see if there is anything worse than fatigue.”
