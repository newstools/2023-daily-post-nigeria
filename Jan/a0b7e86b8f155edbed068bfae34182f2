Manchester United goalkeeper, David de Gea, has claimed the club’s new signing, Wout Weghorst, did ‘very well’ on his debut for Erik ten Hag’s side against Crystal Palace on Wednesday night. De Gea said Weghorst helped Man United on set pieces against Crystal Palace. Weghorst was not a huge part of Man United’s Premier League 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace, really, producing a largely forgettable first performance in a Red Devils shirt. Although Weghorst did attract the attention of the Crystal Palace defenders in the build-up for his side’s goal, allowing Bruno Fernandes space to finish. A goal each from Fernandes and Michael Olise ensured both teams drew at Selhurst Park Stadium. “He [Weghorst] did really well,” De Gea said in his post-match interview after the game. “On set pieces, he is a big lad, he helps us in both areas and I think it was a great debut.” Weghorst joined Man United this month on loan from Burnley.
