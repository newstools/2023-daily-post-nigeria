The court ordered the commission to pay John all his salaries, allowances and entitlements that were withheld throughout the period of his suspension from 2016 till date. In his judgement on Monday, the presiding Judge, Justice Ntong Ntong discharged and acquitted Mr. John and one Anietie Okokon Udoh of a two-count charge of receiving stolen property. The Judge ruled that the payments of Mr John’s salaries and entitlements by the commission should be carried out within three months, on or before 16th April, 2023.” It was gathered that Mr John, a native of Dekina Local Government Area of Kogi State, was the Acting Unit Head of Operations, Mbak Unit Command in Itu Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, where he was said to have received a stolen Samsung Galaxy J7 phone, worth seventy-five thousand Naira. Justice Ntong said the prosecution failed to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt and the witnesses were testifying on hearsay which was not admissible in law. The Judge said the police failed to conduct thorough investigation and the court would not allow itself to be carried away by sentiments and speculations to punish an innocent soul. Justice Ntong, however, said the evidence of the accused was clear, direct and believable that he bought a phone on credit to pay by installments, but later realized that the phone was faulty he returned the phone and collected his deposit. He said “a mere fact that the police arrested a person, gave him the alleged stolen phones and made him pose for journalists, is not enough for the Court to convict such a person.”
