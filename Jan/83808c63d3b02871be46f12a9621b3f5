Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has said the condition of star midfielder Luka Modric is not good. He said the Croatian midfielder’s condition has not been good since after the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Modric led Croatia to a third-place finish at the World Cup where they beat Morocco in Qatar. They beat the likes of Spain and Brazil en route to the semi-finals but were stopped by eventual winners Argentina. However, the amount of game time the 37-year-old has had this campaign seems to have stacked up. Ancelotti said the Croatian has returned from Qatar in poor physical condition. “Modric’s condition is not good after the World Cup. But he will help us this season, little by little,” he told a press conference on Wednesday.
