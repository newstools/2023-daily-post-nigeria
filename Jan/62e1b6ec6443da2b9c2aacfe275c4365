Aloy Ejimakor, Special Counsel to Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has instituted a legal action against the Attorney General of the Federation, AGF, Abubakar Malami. Ejimakor filed a suit against Malami aimed at stopping him from making defamatory publications against Kanu that he jumped bail. He noted that such a publication was prejudicial and injurious against Kanu. In a tweet, the Special Counsel wrote: “I filed a suit against AGF Malami to stop him from making any further defamatory publication that Onyendu #MNK jumped bail. Such publication is highly prejudicial & injurious to MNK’s other cases pending in various courts. It has to stop!” DAILY POST reported that Kanu was first arrested and released by Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court, Abuja in 2017. Following his bail, Kanu left Nigeria for Europe after some soldiers invaded his residence in Afaraukwu, Abia State. He was, however, rearrested in June 2021 in Kenya and repatriated to Nigeria to continue his trial. Following his re-arrest, Malami claimed that the IPOB leader fled Nigeria in 2017.
