The Department of State Security Services, DSS, has debunked reports making the rounds that its operatives invaded the office of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele. There have been reports that the operatives of the secret police invaded the CBN on Monday with the intention to arrest the governor of the apex bank. But DSS in a terse statement issued by its spokesperson, Peter Afunanya described the report as fake and misleading. The statement reads, “The attention of the Department of State Services (DSS) has been drawn to the false news making the round that its operatives invaded the Central Bank of Nigeria and arrested its Governor, today 16/1/23. “This is fake news and quite misleading”.
