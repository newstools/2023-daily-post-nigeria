The Abuja School of Social and Political Thoughts, ASSPT, has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to ensure all eligible voters collect their Permanent Voter Cards, PVCs. The institution also charged the Commission to do everything possible to conduct free, fair and credible elections. DAILY POST reports this in a statement released Monday by ASSPT Director, Dr Sam Amadi. It stated that a multi-party system is crucial to any democratic process. ASSPT added that INEC needs to simplify its digital processes to ensure efficient and timely upload of party agents for the forthcoming elections. “Specifically, we commend INEC for extending the deadline for collecting PVCs but urge it to ensure that all administrative changes required are made to ensure all registered voters who want to vote can collect their PVCs. “INEC should recognize that any Nigerian citizen of voting age who has registered to vote must be accorded the opportunity to vote. By Section 47 of the Electoral Act, this means such a registered voter must receive from the INEC a Permanent Voter Card. The implication is that INEC is under a constitutional obligation to deliver a voter card to all registered voters who have made efforts to collect the same. “We urge INEC to improve its delivery system and overcome some of the managerial shortcomings recorded in the past weeks in this regard”.
