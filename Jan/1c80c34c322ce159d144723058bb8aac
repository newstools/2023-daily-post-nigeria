Arsenal legend Paul Merson has told Chelsea they have no chance of bringing Tottenham striker Harry Kane. According to Merson, moving to Chelsea would mean that the England captain has destroyed his legacy. Kane has spent more than a decade at Tottenham and is now the club’s joint all-time top goalscorer with his 266th goal for the club. Kane’s contract expires at the end of the season and there is fresh speculation over his long-term future in north London. Manchester United are said to have revived their interest in the 29-year-old summer. Chelsea may also be looking for a new No. 9 at the end of the season. But Merson is not the England international moving to Stamford Bridge for any reason. “Harry Kane to Chelsea? That can’t happen,” Merson told Sky Sports. “If he comes to Chelsea, he loses his legacy at Tottenham. Tottenham fans would go mad. “For him to go over to Chelsea, it would be the next notch down from going to Arsenal. Chelsea and Tottenham don’t get on.”
