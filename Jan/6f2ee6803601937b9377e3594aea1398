Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has confirmed Kevin De Bruyne will be available to face Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League tomorrow. De Bruyne sparked rumours yesterday, after he missed training with the rest of the squad. Speaking at his pre-match press conference today, Guardiola revealed the midfielder had been dealing with a personal issue. “He [De Bruyne] had a personal issue and was not training. Today, he is back. “They [Dias and Stones] were in the last two training sessions, they have trained and are in contention,” Guardiola said. City can cut the gap between them and leaders Arsenal to five points with a win against Spurs, who are looking to bounce back from Sunday’s north London derby defeat. Tottenham did the double over the champions last season.
