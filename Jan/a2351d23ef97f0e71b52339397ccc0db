The police charged the defendant of Byazhin Across, Kubwa, Abuja, with criminal conspiracy, unlawful juju and cheating. The Prosecution Counsel, John Okpa, told the court that the defendant, with his cohorts, conspired and induced the complainant, Blessing Joseph, to deliver her earnings to them. Okpa alleged that the defendant induced the complainant while indulging in juju, to deliver the sum of N234,350 cash, four male shirts valued at N40, 000, female dresses and trousers worth N32,000. The prosecution counsel said the defendant collected the items from the complainant at her boutique, in Dutse Alhaji, under the guise of making her have more money. He said the defendant’s deceit caused the complainant wrongful loss, adding that the offence contravened the Penal Code. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty. The judge, Yahaya Sheshi, allowed the defendant to bail in the sum of N500,000 with one surety resident within the court’s jurisdiction.
