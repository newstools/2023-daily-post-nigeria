The Department of State Services (DSS) has denied instituting a litigation against the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mahmood Yakubu. The security agency had been accused of filing a suit against the Professor, over alleged non-declaration of assets, ahead of possible arrest. The spokesperson, Peter Afunanya said there was no issue with the INEC Chairman, blaming the misconception on a newspaper. The DSS noted that the media organisation “skewed what transpired in the court and reported it out of context”. Afunanya expressed disapproval of the report, adding that what was published in its online version was different from the hard copy. “The said report is misleading. It falsely left an impression that the Service went to Court against the INEC Chairman”, he noted. The statement said the DSS is aware of the antics of mischievous elements who are desirous of fomenting the crisis, including creating controversies ahead of the general elections. “One of their strategies is to subvert the efforts in ensuring peaceful coexistence. Another is a determination to overheat the polity and exploit the judiciary or undermine security and law enforcement agencies.” The secret service warned such individuals and groups to desist from devious plans and advised all stakeholders to be vigilant and resist attempts to use them to thwart the law.
