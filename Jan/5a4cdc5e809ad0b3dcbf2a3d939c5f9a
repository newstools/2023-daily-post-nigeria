Yemi Cregx, a Nigerian Big Brother Titans housemate has called out his female colleagues Jenni O, Olivia, Yvonne and Nana for their continual gossiping on the show. Yemi was particularly critical of Jenni O, maintaining that, unlike Nigerian housemates, South African housemates virtually never discuss or complain about one another. ”It’s wrong to be gossiping about South African housemates. It is not nice, and it does not reflect well on Nigeria as a whole”, he said. Yemi is not out of place as the major work of some of the Nigerian female housemates on the ongoing show is gossiping. It was clear to the point that one of them admitted that the only work they do in the house is to gossip and do relationships. In the house, Jenni O, Yvonne, Nana and Olivia are always gossiping. Only two female Nigerian housemates, Sandra and Jaypee are not part of the gossiping circle in the house.
