The spokesperson for the Atiku-Okowa Campaign Organisation in Anambra State, Law Mefor, has claimed the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi, is good but contesting on a weak platform. Mefor also said the Southeast is the traditional land of the PDP. He made this claim on Monday while featuring on the Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily programme. Mefor said the Labour Party is not a good platform for a presidential race. “Southeast has always been the traditional land of the PDP, so we are asking the security agencies to tackle the insecurity in the Southeast to enable PDP to reap from its traditional base. “We know Obi will do well there also, but the PDP structure there is far superior. Obi is good but standing on a weak platform. The Labour Party is not a good platform for a presidential race,'” Mefor said.
