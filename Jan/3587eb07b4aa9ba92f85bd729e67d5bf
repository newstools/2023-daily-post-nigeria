The Nigeria Union of Teachers, (NUT) says the population of teachers both serving and working will decide who will emerge the next Governor of Kogi State after Alhaji Yahaya Bello. The Kogi State Chairman of NUT, Comr. Joel Salifu disclosed this while addressing a press conference on Saturday. Salifu noted that teachers in the State were now better informed on choosing a leader who will serve the interest of them and not make them look like beggars on the street. While admonishing the teachers to go and collect their Permanent Voters’ Cards ahead of the general election, the NUT boss said the only way the teachers could decide their fate and ensure better and improved working conditions is for them to ensure that they collected their PVCs. “We will decide who comes to serve and lead us in the State. We have the numbers. The experience we have gone through has adequately prepared us to decide who will lead us in Kogi State in 2023, particularly with our population. The voices of teachers in the State would be heard loud and clear using the 2023 general election,” he stated. He maintained that 2023 remains a defining moment for teachers in the State having gone through a whole lot of challenges from both present and past administrations.
