The New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) presidential candidate, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso has declared that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are failed political parties. Kwankwaso made this disclosure on Tuesday in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. The former governor of Kano State while addressing hundreds of NNPP supporters at Obafemi Awolowo Stadium, Oke Ado Ibadan, urged Nigerians to reject the APC and PDP with their votes. He said that it is glaring that the two political parties have nothing to offer the country. Kwankwaso, while addressing the gathering during the presidential campaign in Ibadan, insisted that NNPP remains the party to beat in the next general elections. The NNPP candidate, while speaking further, stressed that if Nigerians allow the APC and PDP to continue to rule the country, only God knows what will happen to the country. He also cautioned Nigerians not to fall victim to religious and tribal sentiment in this year’s general elections. He said, “APC and PDP cannot offer Nigeria anything again. Some of them are having issues, some are having personality issues. Let’s go and do the right thing. “Nigeria as a country deserves much better leaders unlike what we are presently having under the ruling APC and the PDP”.
