Cesc Fabregas has described Leandro Trossard as a really good player following the Belgian’s debut for Arsenal in their Premier League clash against Manchester United on Sunday. Trossard came off the bench to contribute to Eddie Nketiah’s winning goal for Mikel Arteta’s side . Arsenal took back their five points lead in the Premier League table after Manchester City had earlier reduced it to just two. Trossard showed flashes of what he will bring to the Premier League leaders and Fabregas is not convinced the Gunners need any more January signings. The former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder was asked if the Gunners still need a couple more signings, he said on Sky Sports: “I think Trossard is a really good player, better than at the moment what people think he is. “He showed it at Brighton and he showed it today for a couple of minutes. He’s different from what they’ve got. “If they can keep going with Eddie [Nketiah] scoring goals and waiting for Gabriel[Jesus] to come back.”
