Brighton manager, Roberto De Zerbi, has refused to rule out the possibility of Moises Caicedo leaving the club before the January transfer window closes. The Seagulls have rejected bids from Arsenal and Chelsea for the 21-year-old. In a statement posted on his social pages on Friday night, Caicedo made it clear he’s hoping to leave before Tuesday’s deadline. Caciedo was dropped for Sunday’s FA Cup fourth round clash against Liverpool. And De Zerbi underlined Brighton’s intention to hold onto their prized midfielder, but admitted the club will consider the best “solution” for all parties. “Moises is a good guy. I think in life you can make mistakes. “For every one there are many solutions and we will see the best solution for the club and for him and for us,” De Zerbi told ITV.
