Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, reportedly doesn’t want midfielder Eduardo Camavinga in his team, according to El Nacional. According to El Nacional, Ancelotti is purportedly not impressed with Camavinga’s performance for Real Madrid as he prefers others in the midfield positions. The former Chelsea and Everton coach believes that Camavinga was a signing made by former Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane. The revelation came after Camavinga’s disappointing performance during Real Madrid’s Supercopa de Espana final defeat against Barcelona last Sunday. Real Madrid lost 3-1 against Barcelona following goals from Gavi, Robert Lewandowski, and Pedri. Karim Benzema scored for Ancelotti’s side at the King Fahd Stadium in Riyadh. There are internal talks about how Camavinga is being treated by Ancelotti at Real Madrid. The 20-year-old France international has been substituted up to seven times by Ancelotti at halftime. In the first half against Barcelona, Camavinga completed only 68% of his passes and lost possession eleven times. Since arriving from Stade Rennais in 2021, Camavinga has made 65 appearances for the LaLiga champions, scoring two goals and providing three assists.
