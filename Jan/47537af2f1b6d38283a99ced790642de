Former Aston Villa man, Gabriel Agbonlahor has said that Mykhailo Mudryk would be a problem for defenders in the Premier League. This was following the Ukrainian’s debut performance for Chelsea against Liverpool on Saturday. Mudryk appeared to be on his way to Arsenal before Chelsea hijacked the deal, paying around £99 million. He came on in the 55th minute of Chelsea’s 0-0 draw with Liverpool and showed some signs of a superstar in the making. The former Shakhtar Donetsk man replaced Lewis Hall shortly after half-time and showed glimpses of his potential. Gabby Agbonlahor tweeted: “Mudryk is gonna be a problem!! You can’t defend pace!!.”
