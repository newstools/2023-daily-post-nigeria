Manchester United hero, Andy Cole, has feared that the club’s target Wout Weghorst would flop at Old Trafford. Cole also questioned Chelsea’s deal for Atletico Madrid forward Joao Felix. Recall that Weghorst has emerged as a shock target for Man United, with the Red Devils manager Erik ten Hag keen to bring his fellow Dutchman to Old Trafford. Weghorst, who is desperate to join Man United, is currently on loan at Turkish club Besiktas, having struggled at Burnley, scoring just two goals in 20 games for the Clarets. Felix, on the other hand, is close to joining Chelsea on loan after flying to London for medical. “Wow! When I heard about Weghorst, I was as surprised as anybody,” Cole told Casinos En Ligne. “I know he got a couple of goals in the World Cup, and he’s on loan in Turkey now, but he had an absolutely terrible time at Burnley. “You can only say if he had such a tough time at Burnley, what can we really expect if he comes to Manchester United?” “Felix is undoubtedly a class player, but if you are talking about £10m for a loan fee, you might as well try to get the deal done on a permanent basis if you fancy him,” Cole added. “I think he will create a lot of goals, but will he score a lot, Erling Haaland style? No. The two are totally different players.”
