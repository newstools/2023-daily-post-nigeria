The Federal Government of Nigeria on Sunday described the kidnapping of train passengers at Tom Ikimi Train Station, Igueben, Edo, as despicable and utterly barbaric. Mr Henshaw Ogubike, the Director of Press and Public Relations, Ministry of Transportation, said this in a statement in Abuja. The statement read in part, “The Public is hereby reassured that the security agencies are making efforts to rescue the kidnapped train passengers. “The Nigeria Police is on the trail of the criminals and have mobilised with a view to protecting the lives and property of the remaining passengers. “Further details will be communicated later.” The government, however, assured of its prompt response to the ugly situation. Recall that some suspected herdsmen purportedly armed with AK 47 rifles attacked the train station at Igueben on January 7 and kidnapped some passengers waiting to board the train to Warri.
