Former Premier League star Martin Keown has slammed Everton winger Anthony Gordon for refusing to return to the club. The 21-year-old England winger has missed three days of training while transfer talks between Everton and Newcastle United are ongoing. According to talkSPORT, Everton and Newcastle United remain £5m apart in their valuation of Gordon. And in an effort to force through a move, the winger has refused to return to Finch Farm on Wednesday and Thursday after being given Tuesday off. Former Arsenal man Keown is not happy with the development. He told talkSPORT, “These young players are so pampered because they are on a pedestal all their life. This is almost like a spoiled child’s behaviour. He needs to behave himself and get back in line and help his football club to stay up.”
