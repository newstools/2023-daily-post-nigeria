President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday commissioned the 41-terabyte national tier-4 Data Center in Kano. Speaking during the ceremony, the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Prof. Ali Isa Pantami said the data centre was the first of its kind in northern Nigeria and the best so far in the country. “The reliability of data collection of the facility is 99.99% so it is almost a hundred per cent reliable,” he said. Prof. Pantami further avowed that the centre would improve the digital economy, provide job opportunities and enhance cybersecurity while supporting the country to consolidate the gains of the digital economy. The centre, which Pantami described as a technology-upgraded facility, is, according to him, built to provide more storage facilities for both public and private sectors across the country, with its 41 terabytes of memory capacity and 2.2-petabyte storage capacity. “Government has its main data centre in Abuja, another one in the South, which is a backup, and this is another one in the North West. “That of Abuja and the South were established some years ago. But this centre here is higher because it is a tier-four data centre. The one we have in Abuja is a tier-three data centre. So, this is an upgrade of the existing data centres we have in the country in both private and public sectors. It is world-class,” Pantami disclosed. The project was executed by Galaxy Backbone Limited.
