The leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has said Nigerians should pay close attention to the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu’s famous word, “Emilokan” because it has a deep spiritual manifestation. Ayodele explained that Nigerians joke a lot with the pronouncements of the APC presidential candidate because they don’t have an idea of what it means spiritually. In a statement by his spokesman, Oluwatosin Osho, Ayodele, cautioned Nigerians against taking Tinubu for granted. He said: ‘’Don’t joke with the chances of the APC, Don’t take Tinubu for granted, he is not old politically and he wants this presidency. “His pronouncements are more spiritual than physical. He speaks with so much authority, his pronouncements are more spiritual but Nigerians think he is playing. ‘’The word ‘Emilokan’ is very spiritual, don’t take Tinubu for a joke with this word. ‘Emilokan’ should wake up the PDP and Labour party from sleeping. The word is more spiritual than physical. If you don’t want Tinubu to win, attack ‘Emilokan.’’ ‘’PDP and Labour party should seek for the spiritual meaning of Emilokan, it’s a mysterious statement that Nigerians are joking with, it is not a joke, it is not proverbial. “Tinubu may even be playing with it, only those that have spiritual eyes can know the in-depth meaning of the word ‘Emilokan.”
