Barcelona captain Sergio Busquets has pinpointed two players who could replace him in the team’s starting XI at Camp Nou when he finally decides to leave the Catalan club. Busquets is out of contract at the end of the current season. The 34-year-old is yet to decide if he will continue with Barcelona or leave for a new club. Speaking at a press conference on Saturday ahead of Barcelona’s Super Cup final tie with Real Madrid on Sunday night, Busquets said the likes of Frenkie de Jong and Nico Gonzalez, who is on loan, could replace him in Xavi’s starting XI. “As has happened with Xavi, Andrés, Leo, you should not compare,” he told reporters, according to Mundo Deportivo. “Anyone can play in my place, Nico is on loan, Frank, Frenkie can play… Each one with their qualities. Outside there are good players but it is a decision of the coach and the club.”
