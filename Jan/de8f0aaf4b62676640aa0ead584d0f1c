The spokesperson for the Tinubu/Shettima Presidential Campaign Council, Festus Keyamo has claimed it’s impossible for the Labour Party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi, to win the forthcoming presidential election. Keyamo, who also is the Minister of State for Labour and Productivity, denied saying Obi’s soaring popularity took his party, the All Progressives Congress, APC, by surprise. The statement was contained in a post via his verified Twitter handle where he said Obi stepping into the Presidential Villa could be compared to a camel passing through the eye of a needle. He wrote: “FAKE NEWS ALERT! A certain quote making the rounds on social/m where I purportedly said, “We never saw Peter Obi coming, he took us all by surprise, the only mistake we made in APC bla bla” is fake news. Obi entering the Villa is like a camel passing through the eye of a needle.”
