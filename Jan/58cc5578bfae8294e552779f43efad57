President Muhammadu Buhari’s Special Assistant on Digital Communications, Bashir Ahmad, has tackled famous Nigerian movie star, Anayo Modestus Onyekwere, popularly known as Kanayo O. Kanayo, over a video clip in which he directed the Igbo living outside the Southeast to remain where they are. Kanayo in the viral video, urged Nigerians of Igbo extraction not to return to South East during the coming elections, alleging that there are plots to reduce the number of Igbos living outside South East. Reacting, Bashir in a tweet on his official handle wrote: “Bashir Ahmad @BashirAhmaad I just watched a video from one Kanayo O Kanayo, the video has damaged the Igbo politics once more. “How can you be a lover of Igbo and recorded such video and released it weeks to national elections. The reality is, numbers can never give Igbo presidency, but negotiations.”
