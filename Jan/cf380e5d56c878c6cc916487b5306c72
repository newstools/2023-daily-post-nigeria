Colonel Rabiu Garba Yandoto (rtd) has described his abduction by bandits as a blessing to Nigeria. Recall that Yandoto was abducted by bandits along Gusau-Tsafe road and regained his freedom after paying N10 million ransom recently. Briefing newsmen in Gusau, Yandoto assured that his abduction was a blessing to the country following his encounter with some bandit leaders declared wanted by the military. He explained that he had a meeting with all those wanted bandits, especially the ones that are listed by the Chief of Defence Staff in the forest where he was held captive. He added that they discussed so many issues which he promised not to disclose for now due to some reasons, stressing that they did not torture him as well and his two children abducted along with him but were treated very well. The retired army officer said that they (bandits) gave him the opportunity to talk as they understood his position as a retired soldier, saying that the reason they didn’t take drastic action against him was that they had some messages which they wanted him to pass to the appropriate authorities. “Some are top secret, some are officials while some are ordinary messages. If both the Federal and Zamfara State governments can implement what the bandit leaders are looking for, it will mark the end of banditry,” he stated.
