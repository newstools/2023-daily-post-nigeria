Parents of the 11 remaining abducted female students of the Federal Government College, Yauri, in Kebbi State, have appealed to Nigerians for financial aid. They are seeking assistance for payment of the ransom demanded by the terrorists holding the hostages. In an open letter by the “Committee of Parents of 11 Abducted Students of F.G.C Birnin Yauri”, the parents disclosed the abductors have demanded N100 million. Chairman and Secretary, Salim Ka’oje and Daniel Alkali said their children (aged 12-16 years) have been in captivity for about 20 months. The girls were among those kidnapped when bandits invaded the school on June 2021. Some are now teenage mothers, while others were pregnant as of November. Ka’oje and Alkali noted that all efforts to negotiate and get the government to intervene and assist “have yielded no success”. “This is what informed the resolution of the parents to seek for assistance in addition to disposing of all their disposable assets to achieve this goal”, the letter reads in part. One of the parents died in November after receiving news of her daughter becoming a mother in a terrorists’ den.
