Al-Nassr assistant coach, Stephane Jobard, has opened up on the club’s new signing, Cristiano Ronaldo’s attitude in training. Ronaldo recently signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with Al-Nassr worth a reported €200 million yearly. His arrival at Al-Nassr has brought the world’s focus to the Saudi Arabian league. After a few training sessions with Ronaldo, Jobard found the Portugal captain humble and willing to get going on the pitch. “In training, Cristiano Ronaldo made a mistake, and I told him that it was only necessary to touch the ball,” Jobard was quoted by Sportskeeda as saying. “He pointed with his thumb up and said: ‘Well, coach..’ and I felt that this humble man wanted to perform on the field.” Jobard continued, “In training, I passed a ball to the legend Cristiano Ronaldo, and he scored it, then I came to him and thanked him for scoring, and I can tell my children about this.” Ronaldo, 37, is yet to make his debut for his new club Al-Nassr.
