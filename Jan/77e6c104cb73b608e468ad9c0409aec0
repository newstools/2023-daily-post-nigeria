President Muhammadu Buhari has said he would deploy the remaining four months he has left as president to be steadfast in governance so as to retire in peace. He made the pledge on Monday in Damaturu while speaking at the palace of the Emir of Damaturu, Hashimi II El-Kanemi. Commenting on security, Buhari enjoined Nigerians to develop a strong sense of confidence in their country, especially its institutions and desist from allowing any terrorist groups to destabilize Nigeria again. ‘‘With the four months I have left as President, I’ll continue to be steadfast and I hope that I will retire in peace,” he stated. The president also noted that the government is committed to protecting the right of Nigerian children to education, particularly those displaced from their homes by Boko Haram. He said, ‘‘We have gone through so much as a country but I will appeal to you all to maintain steadfastness and making sure that we will not allow anybody to disorganize us again”. The number one citizen however expressed delight at the return of peace to Yobe State and Northeast Nigeria. He attributed the prevailing peace to the ingenuity of Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State and his Borno State counterpart, Prof Babagana Zulum. According to Buhari, both leaders have been persistent in reconstructing schools, health centers and institutions destroyed by the misguided terrorists. Recall that Buhari has in recent times been saying he was looking forward to a life of retirement from the presidency as he would stay far away from Abuja the seat of power. He had also stated that he would relocate to his home state, Katsina which shares a border with the Republic of Chad.
