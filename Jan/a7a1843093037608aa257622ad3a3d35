Elder statesman and leader of Afenifere, the apex Yoruba socio-political organisation, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, affirmed that the passion Nigerians have for Peter Obi of Labour Party is incomparable to that of other candidates. Adebanjo made the claim while fielding questions on Arise Television’s State of the Nation news programme on Thursday. He reiterated that it is the turn of the South East to produce the president, saying he was the first person to cry out about that. Adebanjo said, “Well, I believe those who have love in following the trajectory of the Nigerian election must know why we are supporting Peter Obi. Of course, you must remember I was the first person to cry out that it was the turn of the South East. The parties had not done their primaries at that time, but I was just thinking about the constitutionality, logicality and equity of the situation of Nigerian politics from the time of independence. “I think all passion for Obi cannot be compared with others. It is historical, philosophical, logical and constitutional, and even a question of inclusiveness if you are sincere about keeping Nigeria together.”
