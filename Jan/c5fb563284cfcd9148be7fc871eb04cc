Newcastle United legend Alan Shearer has hailed Manchester United boss, Erik ten Hag for winning the battle with Cristiano Ronaldo. He also said the Red Devils could finish top four in the Premier League only on the condition that they bring in a striker this January. Manchester United terminated the contract of Cristiano Ronaldo after the football icon granted an explosive interview to popular British journalist Piers Morgan following a series of face-offs with Ten Hag. Now Manchester United are in the top four of the Premier League level on points with Newcastle in third after a 3-0 win against Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Tuesday night. The Red Devils have to finish above Chelsea, Tottenham, and Liverpool to make it to the Champions League next season. “It’s been tough for him [ten Hag]to have to deal with the Ronaldo situation. He won that battle, which was a big battle for him to win. “I’m sure they’ll try to strengthen in the next couple of weeks and if they can – particularly in the forward area… then they’ll have a good go at being in that top four and staying in there.”
