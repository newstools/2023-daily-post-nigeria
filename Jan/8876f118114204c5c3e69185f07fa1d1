Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State has alleged that opposition parties in the state have concluded plans to import militants from the North Central and Niger Delta regions of the country to wreak havoc on the state during the general election. He further alleged that a large cache of firearms had been discovered buried ‘somewhere’. He made the allegations during the flag-off of APC, the ruling party’s electioneering campaign at Ogoja stadium in the northern part of the state. “We have credible information that the opposition have planned to import militants from the North Central and Niger Delta into Cross River State to unleash mayhem during the elections. “We also have information that cache of arms have been discovered”, he said. Ayade said that the government has further uncovered a “nefarious and evil plot by the opposition and a certain megalomaniac candidate to terrorize the people of Cross River Northern Senatorial district.” He stated that the discovery was made by security agencies. The governor said the full weight of the law would be unleashed by the government to deal with the suspected criminals, who he alleged were ‘people who masquerade as politicians’.
