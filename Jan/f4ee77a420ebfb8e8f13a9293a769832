Rivers State High Court has convicted a man identified as Bestman Lekia to death by hanging for killing four people and using one of his victimsâ€™ intestines to prepare porridge in Okwalie community, Khana Local Government Area of Rivers State. The court also found Lekia guilty of armed robbery, kidnapping, cultism and burglary. The convict and his gang members reportedly said to be at large, murdered Nenalebarri Mmeabe, Loveday Mmeabe, Gbodu Nobale and Etim Ekpe. Lekia and his gang first kidnapped Loveday Mmeabe in 2019, removed his intestines and used them to prepare a plantain meal. Justice Adolphus Enebeli said the prosecution lawyer proved his case beyond every reasonable doubt and ruled that Lekia should be hanged on his neck until he was confirmed dead. Justice Enebeli noted that the attitude of Lekia throughout his trial proved that he was a hardened criminal, terrorist and cultist. Reacting to the judgment, the State prosecutor, Chidi Ekeh described the judgment as erudite, saying that it would save the Ogoni community and Rivers State. Speaking further, Ekeh said as a human being, he was not happy that someone is sentenced to death, but the State would have failed society if Lekia had been allowed to walk free without facing justice.
