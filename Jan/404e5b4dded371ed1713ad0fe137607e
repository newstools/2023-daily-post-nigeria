The Zamfara State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC, has assured residents of the state of a peaceful and rancor free general elections in the state. Speaking while fielding questions from newsmen at the state headquarters Gusau, the State Commandant, Mr. Mohammad Bello Mu’azu, said that the Corps is poised to do its best in synergy with other sister agencies to create a perfect voting condition and atmosphere during the 2023 general elections. Mr. Muazu reaffirmed that the Corps is apolitical and would not hesitate to bring to justice any erring officer who is in any way perceived to have taken political sides. He explained that the Corps has already galvanized all aspects and units of the organization to effectively give the needed peace during and after the elections. The State NSCDC boss, therefore, called on the people of Zamfara State to turn out massively and exercise their franchise during the general elections. He assured the general public of absolute freedom and security to exercise their civic responsibilities. The commandant, however, reiterated that the Corps will deal ruthlessly in line with extant laws of the federation, anyone or groups who are bent on truncating the peaceful conduct of the elections. Mr. Mu’azu warned all miscreants and those fanning the embers of political mischief to halt or relocate from the state.
