The ruling APC in Cross River State and the opposition PDP have been charged to give accounts of the cumulative sum of N84 billion Bakassi Stabilization Fund which the state has received so far from the federal government since 2008 to date. The governorship candidate of the African Democratic Congress, ADC, in the state, Mr Effiong Nyong made the charge in a statement released in Calabar. He said at different times members of the two parties have belonged to either party and have been privy to the receipts and disbursements of the special fund meant for the development of Bakassi. He said: “The two so-called big political parties in Cross River State know what has been happening to the Bakasssi Stabilization Fund of N500 million monthly collection from the federal government. “Since 2008, a total of N84 billion, at N6 billion per year, has been received in the state, and there is nothing to show for it. “These same individuals are campaigning in Bakassi and other parts of the southern senatorial zone of the state, pledging and promising all manner of things, and they know they are lying.” Nyong, a journalist, maintained that people in the state are undermined and taken for granted by the political class. He charged the people not to be sentimental with their Permanent Voter’s Cards. Said he: “Vote out corruption; vote to restore the civil service; vote to ensure our elders get their pension and gratuity. Vote to ensure sanitation in our environment. “Vote to change our tourism narrative for the better. Our economy can be better managed. Enough is Enough.” Nyong lamented that Nigerians never envisaged in their wildest dreams that things could be this bad in the country.
