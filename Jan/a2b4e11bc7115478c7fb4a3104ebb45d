The Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) has unveiled Cyrus Oluwaseun Johnson as the new governorship candidate of the party in Ogun State. This is coming barely four months after its former candidate, Prof. David Bamgbose died. DAILY POST recalls that Bamgbose, an educationist, died after a brief illness in September 2022, seven days from the day he was unveiled as the PRP candidate. However, the State Chairman of the PRP, Samson Okusanya, on Wednesday, unveiled Johnson as the new candidate to replace Bamgbose Okusanya said Johnson, a professional accountant, had emerged winner of a fresh primary election, which he said was monitored by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) recently. He expressed confidence that the PRP would win the next election “because we are fully on ground in all the 236 wards.” Speaking with newsmen, the PRP governorship candidate said the party would run a people-centred government if he emerged as the governor. He said, “We want to run a people-centred government because whatever you do that does not put the people first is just shadow-boxing. “In Ogun State, the first thing for us is agriculture which will translate into the availability of food. We should have gone past the stage where corn will only be available once in a year, we should make food available on every table. It is when a person is fed that he works and studies well. “The next is education. The present government has neglected education and everybody knows that. In our government, education from primary to secondary school will be free, compulsory and qualitative.” He called on Ogun people to get their voter’s cards and vote for the PRP in the coming elections.
