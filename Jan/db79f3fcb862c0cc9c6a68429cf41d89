Nigeria forward, Victor Olatunji will spend the remainder of the season at three-time Czech champions, Slovan Liberec. Olatunji linked up with Slovan Liberec from Cypriot outfit, AEK Larnaca. Liberec first showed interest in the striker last summer but was rebuffed by Larnaca. The 23-year-old featured for Larnaca in the UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds and Europa League this season. Liberec manager, Lubos Kozel can’t hide his excitement after signing the player. “This is a striker who is tall, strong in the air and in tackles. We do not have such a player in the team. Maybe Michael Rabušic is slightly similar to him,” Kozel told the club’s official website.
” We needed a striker after the departure of Mick van Buren and when Max Talovjerov left us, we also needed a player applicable to standard situations. “
