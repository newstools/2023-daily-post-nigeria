Chairman of Kwara Geographic Information Service, Malam AbdulMutalib Shittu has dismissed reports insinuating that he is under investigation by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC. Briefing journalists on the agency’s stewardship in land administration in Ilorin on Thursday, he warned journalists against Kangaroo or beer parlour journalism. Shittu said his agency’s conversation with the anti-graft body was not a new thing because they are in partnership to provide information and track suspected money laundering and asset recovery among others. “This is not the first time the EFCC will engage in conversation with our agency, particularly on landed properties owned by some people under investigation. “The fact that people see me at the EFCC does not mean I am under investigation. I was in their office from Monday to Friday, so what is the issue? he queried. Shittu said most of the ongoing investigations are from 2011 based on petitions received by the EFCC, adding that most of the directors in the Geography Information Service, had been to Abuja and back to assist the anti-graft body. The chairman disclosed that the agency generated about N1b last year for the government representing the highest so far by the agency. Shittu said the new policy of the agency under his watch will reduce the processing days of Certificate of Occupancy to 30 working days, while building permits can be obtained in two weeks. He revealed that the services of the agency will also be decentralized with the creation of zonal offices to reduce the stress of the people and hasten service delivery. Shittu said the training of staff and their welfare would be prioritized to motivate them to give their best. On the challenges posed by the new policies of the agency, the chairman called for patience and understanding of the public to serve them better.
