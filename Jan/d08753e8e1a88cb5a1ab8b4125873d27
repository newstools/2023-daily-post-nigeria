Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has warned the Executive Chairman of Ahoada East Local government Area of the state, Hope Ikiriko to ensure he delivers at least 50% of the total votes of the LGA to the Peoples Democratic Party. The Governor said the council chairman will “be in trouble” if he delivers anything less than 50%. Wike made the threat while flagging off a road project in the local government on Thursday. The Governor’s threat followed a request by the council boss to Wike to construct a road in ward 10 which infuriated the governor. Wike berated the council chairman for making such demands despite receiving nothing less than N300 million naira in allocation in the last few months. He said, “I know how much you people get. In the last few months, no local government got less than N300, 000,000 to N400,000,000, not one. What’s the salary bill? Where did the money go to? “How many votes do you bring? Last election, 10,000 to 13,000 votes and you come here to tell me Ward 10 does not have roads. “Ahoada East registered nothing less than 90,000 voters, let me see anything less than half of those votes then you will come and give an account of your projects. “If I see anything less than 50% of the votes, you will be into trouble. “Return votes based on the number of projects”.
