Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has suggested that his team defeated Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 in Sunday’s Premier League derby because his players showed ‘courage.’ Arteta watched as an own-goal from Hugo Lloris, and a goal from Martin Odegaard gave Arsenal all three points against Antonio Conte’s side. The result against Tottenham means Arsenal are now eight points at the top of the Premier League table ahead of second position Man City. Speaking at his post-match press conference after the match, Arteta said, “I’m very happy for two reasons. One, because I saw a team with courage and that really wanted to win. And the other one where we are today. “We have a job where we are really privileged to make people happy. Sharing the victory with the fans was really special and all the suffering makes sense.”
