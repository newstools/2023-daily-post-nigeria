Crisis rocked the ancient community of Ikare-Akoko, Akoko North East Local Government Area of Ondo State on Wednesday when youths of the town engaged in a free-for-all at a carnival. During the bloody fracas, about six youths were said to have been seriously injured. According to sources, the violence was said to have been ignited due to the aged long rivalry between the two monarchs. Youths from the Olukare side were allegedly denied access to the celebration space by youths from the Iyometa neighbourhood, a move which forced the Olukare youths to react by disrupting the New Year’s carnival. The youths allegedly engaged themselves with gunfire which forced residents to scamper for safety. According to sources, “When the Olukare youths wanted to use the place for the carnival on Tuesday, the Owa Ale people stopped them and there was crisis. The shooting was much that the town became deserted. “This morning (Wednesday) the youths mobilised for another attack and the shootings continue. Many shops have been closed down but the police have intervened.” Confirming the incident, Ondo Police spokesman, Funmilayo Odunlami, said the police have been able to calm the situation and returned normalcy to the area.
