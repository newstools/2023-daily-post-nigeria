The Atiku/Okowa Campaign Organization has accused the Presidential Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu of trying to blackmail President Muhammadu Buhari. A statement on Wednesday by the spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan said Tinubu was also blaming his own party and the Federal Government “over his looming devastating rejection by Nigerians”. Ologbondiyan noted that Tinubu claimed that the redesigning of the naira notes and the fuel crisis were plots to scuttle his electoral chances. He accused Tinubu of trying to hoodwink Nigerians by seeking to exonerate himself and blame others in the Buhari led-APC administration from the biting fuel scarcity. “In reality, he is known to be behind the insensitive and anti-people policies that have brought so much calamity to our country including the current persistent fuel scarcity.” Ologbondiyan said it speaks volumes of Tinubu’s character to “pretend” to care for the pain citizens are passing through because it is beginning to affect his ambition. “Tinubu is lamenting over the redesigning of the naira just because the policy has frustrated his boastful plots to use slush fund, which he reportedly stashed away in secret vaults, for vote buying and manipulative schemes.” Ologbondiyan said only politicians who have always won elections by relying on bullion vans have become troubled over the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) monetary policy to redesign the currency. The Atiku camp wonder why Tinubu would attempt to now distance himself from a government he had been a part of since 2015. The campaign organisation said the former Lagos governor ought to know that “Nigerians can see through his antics and diversionary theatrics” on the fuel and new naira notes issue. “Fom the songs of lamentation of Asiwaju Tinubu, it is clear that his presidential life ambition has collapsed”, the statement added.
