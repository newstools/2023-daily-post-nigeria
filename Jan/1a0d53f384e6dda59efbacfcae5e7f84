Benfica have rejected Chelsea’s astonishing 90 million plus three players offer for their midfielder Enzo Fernandez. According to Portuguese outlet Diario Record, Chelsea tabled an offer of €90 million plus Hakim Ziyech, along with David Datro Fofana and Andrey Santos on loan to Benfica to sign Fernandez. However, the Blues’ surprising bid was rejected by the Portuguese giants. Fernandez is one of Europe’s most sought-after talents at the moment after he led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar last December. He has attracted interest from multiple Premier League outfits, including Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United. Chelsea were understood to be in pole position to secure Fernandez’s signature, but Benfica manager Roger Schmidt has now declared his intention that he doesn’t want the player to leave Portugal for Stamford Bridge this January transfer window. Benfica president Rui Costa is reportedly adamant about the release clause, and the two outfits have not held a new meeting since negotiations fell through.
