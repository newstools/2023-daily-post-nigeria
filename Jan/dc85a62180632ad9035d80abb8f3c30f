President Muhamamdu Buhari has attributed Nigeria’s insecurity problem to powerful countries bent on destroying Nigeria. Buhari made the assertion on Monday in Kano at a presidential lunch after his tour around the state to commission projects by the administration of Governor Ganduje. According to him: “One can clearly see how these foreign countries took on our weaker part of Nigeria, the Lake Chad where we have reserves of crude oil, and cause serious mayhem there with consistent attacks.” But for Governor Zulum who is serious with his duty, the story of the area around Lake Chad would have been different by now, Buhari said. The President reminded that in 2015 when he assumed office, only four of Borno’s 17 local government areas were not in the hands of Boko Haram. “And we are aware that people are using the insurgents who are fraudulent to cause problems, but today most of these local governments [areas] are free,” he said. The President added that those behind the insecurities knew that Borno was potentially a rich state. “That was why when I was a governor there, I went to Niger, Chad and even Cameroon because you need your neighbours to survive,” he stated. Buhari who expressed happiness with Governor Ganduje for the infrastructural development in Kano State also commended governors of Lagos, Kaduna, Katsina and Kogi states for doing good in their respective states. The president also urged the elite to work on the education of youths, saying the lack of education among them is a problem. President Buhari also cracked a joke saying he has huge qualifications including that of suffering and enjoyment while reminding that he was in prison and had contested the presidency on several occasions.
