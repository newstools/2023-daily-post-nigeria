A retired Army colonel, Mr. Rabi,u Garba Yandoto and his two children, who were abducted last week by gunmen, are still languishing in the bandits’ den. This is as the N5 million ransom demanded by their abductors have not been paid. The retired army officer and his two children were abducted by unidentified gunmen suspected to be terrorists along Gusau -Tsafe road in Zamfara State last week Friday. DAILY POST gathered that they were on their way to their country home in Yandoto when they were ambushed by bandits who forced them into the forest. According to a relation of the retired Colonel who preferred anonymity for security reason, the bandits called him and demanded the sum of N50 million ransom immediately after the retired Colonel and his children were kidnapped. He said that after much pleadings and negotiations by the family of the retired Colonel, the kidnappers reduced the money to 5 million naira which he said had not been paid as of the time of filing this report. “The abductors have been phoning me constantly warning that the money should be paid without delay if we still want the retired military officer and his children alive. “At first, we, the family members thought that they were abducted by assassins due to Yandoto’s political involvement. “We have not got the five million naira demanded by the kidnappers but we are still struggling to raise the money through community efforts and contribution from friends and well wishers,” he said. But when contacted, the State police command’s spokesman, SP Mohammed Shehu denied having any knowledge of N5 million naira ransom demanded by the abductors. According to him, the State police command was not sleeping over the issue, saying that the command’s Tactical Operatives were on top of the matter.
