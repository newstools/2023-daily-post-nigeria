Argentina goalkeeper, Franco Armani, has spoken about the motivating speech that captain Lionel Messi delivered to his teammates before their 2022 FIFA World Cup final against France in Qatar. Recall that Messi scored two goals in the final against France as the match ended in a 3-3 draw after extra time. La Albiceleste eventually defeated France 4-2 on a penalty shoot-out to win the World Cup. Speaking to TyC Sport, Armani discussed Messi’s incredible leadership skills both on and off the pitch. He also described the Paris Saint-Germain forward as a very humble person, insisting that his speech makes you devour your opponent. “Messi is an absolute leader inside and outside the locker room. I remember motivating speech before the final against France, his words make you go to the stadium and devour the opponent. “The truth is, he deserved it more than anyone. It was the only thing he needed to put a final seal on his career. He left everything in each game. You saw him and you wanted to hug him and congratulate him on the victory, dedication and camaraderie. He’s a very humble person and open to everything.”
