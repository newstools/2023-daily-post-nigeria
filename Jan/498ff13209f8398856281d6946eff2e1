Arsenal hero, Paul Merson, has backed Chelsea to finish in the Premier League top four this season, insisting that they still have the chance to catch top-four rival Newcastle United. Merson also singled out two Chelsea stars, Mykhailo Mudryk and Benoit Badiashile, for special praise. Chelsea has slipped to 10th in the Premier League table this season. Graham Potter’s side is 10 points outside the UEFA Champions League places and 21 points adrift of leaders Arsenal. But Merson believes Chelsea, alongside Arsenal, Manchester United and Manchester City, will finish in the top four this term. ‘I don’t worry about Chelsea. I think they will be just fine,” Merson told Sky Sports. “I think Chelsea will go on a little bit of a run. He has got to start somewhere. “They [Chelsea] are 10 points behind Newcastle, who are the team I think they have got to chase down. I think Man City, Man Utd and Arsenal will be in the top four. “If you beat Newcastle at home then it is seven points. There is a chance if they can get on a run. There are still a lot of games – people forget we had a World Cup. We are only halfway now.” “Mykhailo Mudryk looks like an outstanding buy,” Merson added. “He looked very lively and pacey against Liverpool. “They look solid at the back, too, with two clean sheets on the trot. Benoit Badiashile looked outstanding – and he is playing with one of the greatest of all time with Thiago Silva.”
