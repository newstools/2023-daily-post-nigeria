Real Madrid striker, Karim Benzema has said that he and Cristiano Ronaldo do not have to take pictures to show they are friends. Benzema said this while explaining why he was not pictured with the Portuguese legend when the Al-Nassr superstar attended Los Blancos’ training on Saturday. The former Manchester United forward now plays for Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr after terminating his contract with the Red Devils. Benzema-led Real Madrid are in Saudi Arabia for the Supercopa de Espana, and Ronaldo was in their training ground on Saturday ahead of the team’s Supercopa de Espana final against Barcelona on Sunday. Real Madrid has also invited the former Manchester United and Juventus star to watch the game. Ronaldo met several Real Madrid players, including Rodrygo, who was filmed shivering out of excitement. Benzema, though, was not spotted anywhere near his former attacking partner in the videos that emerged online. This has led to speculation about the two former Real Madrid teammates not being on the same page. “We don’t need to take photos to say we’re friends, the photos are for Instagram or Twitter, that’s another world,” Benzema said, according to Goal. “We didn’t have time to greet each other because I was training and immediately he also went to train. I hope to see him tomorrow at the stadium and be able to talk to him for a while.”
