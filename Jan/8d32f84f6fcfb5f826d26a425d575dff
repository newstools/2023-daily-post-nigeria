Member, House of Representatives, representing Kaura Federal Constituency, Mr Gideon Gwani, has called the federal and Kaduna state governments to take decisive steps towards bringing an end to the series of attacks in Southern Kaduna that have claimed lives and properties. Speaking to newsmen on Sunday during the Kagoro Chiefdom prayer summit in collaboration with Global Peace Foundation Nigeria, the lawmaker noted that the insecurity situation following the series of attacks the people are going through has made life unbearable for his constituents. According to him, “The recent renewed attacks is what one can not really understand but on our part, we are talking to the people to always be law-abiding and allow the security personnel to do their constitutional duties by ensuring the perpetrators of the deadly acts are made to face the full wrath of the law.” As a representative of the area, he explained that he has moved motions in the House of Representatives, saying that there are resolutions but it is left with the government to ensure that concrete steps are taken to bring peace and sanity in the entire Southern Kaduna. He added, “Following the various attacks, many communities have been vacated while the affected people are left to carry their cross with nothing coming from the government to resettle them for them to continue with life.” He expressed concern with the attitude of the military for not taking prompt action to repel the attackers from the killing and destruction of properties in Kagoro communities, but praised the efforts of the police for their prompt action in saving the situation.
