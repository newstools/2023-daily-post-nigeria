Benfica head coach Roger Schmidt has slammed Chelsea, accusing the Premier League giants of being disrespectful in their approach to Enzo Fernandez. The manager said that Chelsea succeeded in making the Argentine ‘crazy’ in attempts to force the move. Benfica do not want the Argentina international to leave the club for less than his £106 million release clause. But the Blues have attempted to negotiate a deal and have made an offer of £112 million over three yearly instalments. Todd Boehly and his team have also submitted £ 79 million along with winger Hakim Ziyech and two other players on loan. Schmidt attacked Chelsea, accusing Graham Potter’s side of ‘trying to pretend’ they can pay the release clause. The manager insisted that they actually do not want the World Cup winner to leave the Portuguese giants but expected the Blues to go ahead to pay the clause instead of to start negotiating again. According to him, if Fernandez wants to leave the club and Chelsea pays the clause in his contract, Benfica will not stop him from leaving. “There is a club who want our player. They know we don’t want to sell the player,” he told the press on Thursday.
