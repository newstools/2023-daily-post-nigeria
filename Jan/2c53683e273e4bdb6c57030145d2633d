Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has spoken about Chelsea’s latest recruits ahead of their Premier League clash on Saturday. Chelsea brought in Joao Felix on a six-month loan deal from Atletico Madrid this month and followed that with the signing of Mykhailo Mudryk from Shakhtar Donetsk. The Ukrainian is likely to play his first game for Chelsea against Liverpool on Saturday and Klopp envisaged what Chelsea would look like with Joao Felix and Mudryk leading the attack from the wings. Asked if he expected the 22-year-old to play against Liverpool at the weekend, Klopp in his pre-match press conference said: “He’s a good player, a really good player. “He played an incredible Champions League campaign at his former club – speed, technique, goals, combined a lot. Having him for example on one wing and Joao Felix on the other… wow! “Joao Felix played two days after he arrived, pretty much immediately so you can expect him to play. “It makes analysis a little bit easier. We have watched a bit of him in the Champions League and that was impressive enough.”
