A family member of each of the seven slain personnel of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), has been granted automatic employment by the federal government. Rauf Aregbesola, the Minister of Interior made the announcement on Thursday in Kaduna during a condolence visit to the families of the affected personnel. The personnel of the Corps were at Brinin-Gwari ambushed and killed alongside other security personnel by terrorists and have all been given a state burial in Kaduna. Olusola Odumosu, the spokesman of the NSCDC, in a statement explained that Dr Ahmed Abubakar Audi, the Commandant General of NSCDC, delivered the minister’s message during the condolence visits to the respective families of the affected personnel. According to the statement, it is a service that has its personnel in mind and it is the vision of the Minister to champion the course of promoting personnel’s welfare in the Corps. The statement added, “The minister has approved one slot each for you to replace your husbands.” The statement said the minister has also directed the Kaduna State Commandant, Idris Yahaya, to liaise with the families on getting their details to Abuja. The Corps helmsman hinted that he had initiated the process of payment of death benefits and other entitlements to the affected officers through the office of the Minister of Interior to ameliorate the pains of those they left behind. Cheques of an undisclosed amount of money were presented to the next of kin of the seven fallen heroes as a token of support pending the payment of their accrued benefits. The CG also announced the elevation of SCA Thomas Hassan, the only survivor of the attack. He was elevated to the rank of Inspector of Corps (IC) from Senior Corps Assistant (SCA) and was immediately decorated with his new rank. He was charged to teach others the manoeuvring tactics used to survive such a dangerous attack to minimise casualties in case of similar confrontations by criminals.
