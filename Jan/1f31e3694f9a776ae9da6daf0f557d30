A notorious Boko Haram commander, Abou Hurairah has been eliminated after surviving different military assaults. Hurairah was killed alongside other warlords during the raid of a location in Marte Local Government Area, Borno State. The bombardment by the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation Hadin Kai (OPHK) was conducted with Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha jets. Hurairah and fellow Boko Haram insurgents perpetrated a series of attacks in the Monguno area in recent weeks. “He also coordinated attacks in Marte, Ngala, Kukawa, and Abadam,” a defence intelligence source told PRNigeria. The death of Hurairah followed the annihilation of more than 100 terrorists in Bama LGA late last month. The mission, conducted at Mantari village by the Air Component of OPHK, took out sect leaders Khalid Tukur, Maimusari, and Bakura Jega.
