A yet-to-be-identified male adult has been killed in a clash between Yoruba Nation agitators and the police in the Ojota area of Lagos State on Monday. The spokesperson for the police in Lagos, Benjamin Hundeyin, confirmed the death of the unidentified person. Commuters ran to safety in the heat of the pandemonium, which broke out on Monday morning. Some agitators reportedly came out to demand Yoruba Nation, among others, and the police came out to curtail them, leading to a clash. Shortly after they took to the streets, the men of the Lagos State Police Command came out in procession with a detachment of personnel from the Rapid Response Squad, State Taskforce and conventional divisional officers. Security operatives arrived at the scene and shot teargas to disperse the crowd. A police van was reportedly burnt in the ensuing outrage.
