Manchester City centre-back, John Stones has warned Arsenal that there is ‘still a long way to go’ in the Premier League title race this season. Stones, who said Man City players don’t focus on the Premier League table, also urged Pep Guardiola’s side to keep the momentum going after beating Chelsea in Thursday’s Premier League tie. Man City are now five points behind leaders Arsenal in the Premier League table after beating Chelsea 1-0 at Stamford Bridge, thanks to Riyad Mahrez’s second-half goal. “We don’t focus on the table, as the manager said before this game there were 66 points to play for. “There’s still a long way to go and we have got to take it game by game. We’ve got to keep the momentum going. “If we perform like we did today, I’m sure we will have a fighting chance at the end of the season,” Stones told Sky Sports after the game.
