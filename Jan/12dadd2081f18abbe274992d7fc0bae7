The Osun State Governor, Ademola Adeleke has urged politicians to embrace peaceful electioneering strategies as the nation prepares for the February general elections. Adeleke made this known while receiving leaders of thought from Osun state, Friday evening. Adeleke who condemned the increasingly disruptive nature of campaigns in some areas of the state, particularly the vandalization of billboards and posters also openly condemned revolt against state authorities. According to a statement signed by Olawale Rasheed, the Spokesperson of the governor, “Violent activities including vandalization of campaign posters and billboards increased in the last five days after former Governor Gboyega Oyetola’s return to the state. “I call on politicians and their supporters to remain peaceful. We must imbibe the culture of harmonious campaigns devoid of thuggery and untoward activities. Election is not and, should not be taken as war. “Election is about the people exercising their voting rights. Our jobs as political leaders is to market our programmes and candidates, to convince voters to accept us. It is out of order to propagate and employ violence as an electioneering tool. “I particularly condemn the increasing vandalization of campaign posters and billboards ahead of the elections. I was a victim during the last governorship election. Politicians should know that the people are the ultimate decider of their leaders.” While directing security agencies in the state to arrest and prosecute anybody caught destroying candidates’ billboards and posters irrespective of party affiliations, Adeleke assured that sanity, law and order must be restored to the nation’s electoral process.
