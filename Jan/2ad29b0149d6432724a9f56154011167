Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder, Jamie O’Hara, has named former Burnley coach, Sean Dyche, as the perfect manager to replace Frank Lampard at Everton. Lampard is currently under intense pressure to save his job at Everton after his team’s poor performances so far this season. The Chelsea legend watched as Brighton came to Goodison Park to beat Everton 4-1 in a Premier League tie on Tuesday. After Brighton’s win over Everton, the home fans booed Lampard and the players off the pitch. Everton, who have won just one of their last ten Premier League matches, will drop into the relegation zone if they fail to win their next Premier League game against Southampton. However, O’Hara believes Dyche, who last coached Burnley, would be a good appointment to take over from Lampard if Everton decides to sack the former England midfield maestro. “I don’t want to say Frank Lampard should lose his job as I like Frank and I want to see him sort it out and get it fixed. If they do decide to make a change, I think Sean Dyche would be a good appointment,” Jamie O’Hara told Sky Sports. “I actually think he is the perfect fit for them. If you look at the managers who are available and who would potentially take that job, Dyche is the perfect fit. When you watch Everton at the moment, their defence is all over the place. “Lampard has had that in the past where defensively, Chelsea conceded too many goals. Dyche would come in and sort that out for sure. If they were to get rid of Frank, the only man for the job would be Dyche.”
