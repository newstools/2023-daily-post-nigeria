Manchester United defender, Lisandro Martinez, has lavished praise on the club’s new signing, Wout Weghorst, insisting that the 30-year-old is working very well in training. Martinez also said he was happy for Weghorst after the forward scored a goal in Manchester United’s Carabao Cup semi-final 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest on Wednesday night. “As a striker, he lives for the goals, and I am happy for him because he is training very well as well,” Martinez told MUTV. “We need that confidence and I am happy he scored today. Now we have to work for the next game – it is not done yet.” Weghorst joined Man United from Burnley on loan earlier this month.
