The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Sokoto State on Monday received Zayyanu Wamakko, the nephew of the leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the state, Sen. Aliyu Wamakko (APC, Sokoto North) and hundreds of defectors from other political parties. Gov. Aminu Tambuwal, who received the defectors, appreciated them for joining the party. Tambuwal, who is the Director General of the PDP Presidential Campaign Council, described PDP as the best choice for Nigerians. He advised the teeming youths to engage in house-to-house campaigns for more support and keep their Permanent Voter’s Cards, PVCs, safe. “A PDP government, if elected, has designed workable strategies to end banditry, fight corruption, unemployment, address infrastructural decay and boost the socio-economic life of Nigerians among other issues,” NAN quoted him.
