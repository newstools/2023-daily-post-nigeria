The All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for granting the request to extend the deadline for the naira swap. Tinubu issued the commendation during his town hall meeting in Benin City, Edo State. He disclosed that ‘our wives’ selling garden eggs, carrots, and roasted corn are the most affected by the naira swap. According to Tinubu: “We have been on this for three to four days, and suddenly today, when the President said okay out of great respect he will consider our request for an extension, we were happy. “I was running back and forth on this and calling him, so that is what we have been doing. “Hopefully, even though we didn’t get all that we wanted, we got an extension by a number of days. “Some of our cousins, our wives selling garden eggs, carrots, roasted corn, they need money, and they need Naira. “In the process, if Naira is cancelled the way it is and we fail to intervene, we have failed in our duties.” The Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, had announced January 31st 2023 as the deadline for the swap of old naira notes with new ones. With few days to the deadline, Nigerians had lamented their inability to swap their old notes with the redesigned ones. But, the CBN extended the deadline to February 10. Last year, the apex bank redesigned the N200, N500, and N1000 notes.
