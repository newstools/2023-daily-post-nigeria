Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp, has revealed that he was responsible for his side’s Premier League 3-0 defeat to Brighton on Saturday evening. Klopp also admitted Liverpool are at a “really low point,” saying it was his job to make the right line-up to set up the right tactics against Brighton. The German watched as a brace from Solly March and a goal from Danny Welbeck gave Brighton all three points against Liverpool at Falmer Stadium. Speaking at his post-match press conference after the game, Klopp said that the outcome of the match was ‘horrible to watch.’ Klopp said, “I’m not sure if it’s because the game is still a few minutes ago, but I can’t remember a worse game. I honestly can’t. Not only Liverpool. “That’s my responsibility. That makes it a really low point.” He added, “It’s fully my responsibility with a different formation and it didn’t work out. The outcome was horrible to watch.”
