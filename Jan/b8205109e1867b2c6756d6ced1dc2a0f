The Minister of Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, has reacted to the sacking of the governor of Osun State, Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, by the election tribunal. Governor Adeleke’s victory was overturned on Friday by the election tribunal, declaring Gboyega Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress, APC, as the authentic winner. Keyamo congratulated Oyetola, saying the PDP is well known for rigging elections. He wrote, “Congratulations, Governor Oyetola of Osun State. PDP & rigging are 5 & 6. All Nigerians must watch them in the forthcoming elections, too. They want to take us back to the dark days of ballot snatching and writing of results, despite the best efforts of President Muhammadu Buhari.”
