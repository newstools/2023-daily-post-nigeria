The Chairman, Body of Benchers, Chief Wole Olanipekun, SAN, has called for urgent intervention on the state of courtrooms in Nigeria. Olanipekun appealed to different governments all over the country, as well as all men of goodwill, saying “we have to pay attention to the deteriorating state of courtrooms, court facilities and fixtures, in most parts of the country.” Olanipekun made the remarks in Ikere-Ekiti, his country home at the commissioning of the ultra-modern courtroom, built and donated to the Ekiti State High Court, Ikere Judicial Division, yesterday. According to the legal luminary: “The walls and roofs of a good number of our courtrooms are collapsing and caving in. Basic facilities such as toilets are not available in a good number of courts all over the country. Olanipekun said the ambience of a typical or average courtroom should reflect an atmosphere of learning that judges and lawyers subscribe to, and are known for, rather than being unkempt. “I venture to submit that a good courtroom with up-to-date facilities will attract the confidence of litigants in our judicial system. “If we continue to fail, refuse and neglect to maintain Justice, Justice, in turn, may refuse to regulate us, and eventually desert us,” he said. Ekiti State Governor, Mr Biodun Oyebanji, while commending Chief Olanipekun for the donation said this is yet another demonstration of his commitment to giving back to the law profession where he has made his mark as a distinguished member of the Bar and the Bench. “I, therefore, call on all Ekiti indigenes all over the world to emulate this act of generous giving back,” said Governor Oyebanji.
