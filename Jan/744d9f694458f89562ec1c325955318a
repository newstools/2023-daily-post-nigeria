Ademola Lookman scored a brace for the second consecutive game as Atalanta defeated Spezia 5-2 in a thrilling Coppa Italia Round of 16 clash on Thursday afternoon. The Nigeria international was on target twice in Atalanta’s 8-2 rout of Salernitana in a league game last weekend. In his first appearance in the Coppa Italia, Lookman scored two quick goals to set the tone for his side’s victory. The winger nodded home on 10 minutes for Atalanta’s first goal. Lookman added the second two minutes later after a quick one-two with Duvan Zapata. The 25-year-old has now scored 11 goals in 18 games across all competitions for La Dea this season. Gian Piero Gasperini’s side will face Inter Milan in the quarter-final.
