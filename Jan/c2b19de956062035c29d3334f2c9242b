Former Manchester United captain, Gary Neville, has said Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Jesus have the experience to help Arsenal win the Premier League. Neville was speaking after the Gunners beat United 3-2 on Sunday. The result saw Arsenal restore their five-point gap at the top of the table. According to Neville, Mikel Arteta’s men will need composure in high-pressure games as the season enters its second half. “When you’re going for a league title, it’s going to be really pressurized for those players. They will require not just that passion but they’ll also require composure and some calm authority at times. “They have got players such as Zinchenko and Gabriel Jesus who know what it’s like, they’ve been there before. “It’s really exciting to think what this Arsenal team can achieve. “They need to now go on and prove to us that they can win the title, which is going to be really tough,” Neville said on Sky Sports.
