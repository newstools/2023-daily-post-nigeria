The New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, Rabiu Kwankwaso has described the endorsement of his Labour Party counterpart, Peter Obi, by former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Edwin Clarke as inconsequential. Kwankwaso said those endorsing Obi would be shocked by the outcome of the presidential election. He spoke while addressing journalists in Asaba, Delta State, after his campaign rally. Kwankwaso said those endorsing Obi had lost touch with reality because Nigerians are looking for credible leaders that would solve their problems. Stressing that Nigerians are conversant with their candidates, Kwankwaso insisted that the endorsement “is null and void.” According to Kwankwaso: “The endorsement is inconsequential, it means absolutely nothing. You see people who are really out of touch with the reality on the ground, the young men and women of today are looking for a way out, and they have more facts than anybody who is endorsing. “I am happy to say that I am being endorsed by the masses of this country, and these are the people who are at the grassroots level. “Many people, including the endorsers are out for shock in the 2023 election, many people will be surprised.” Obasanjo had endorsed Obi’s candidacy in a letter to Nigerian youths.
