Arsenal legend, Paul Merson, has singled out Liverpool defender Joel Matip for criticism during the Reds’ Premier League 3-0 defeat to Brighton on Saturday. Merson blamed Matip for the first goal Liverpool conceded against Brighton, insisting that the player made a terrible error at the Falmer Stadium. Two goals from Solly March and a goal from Danny Welbeck ensured Brighton defeated Liverpool at home. The first goal Liverpool conceded was due to a poor touch from Matip, which allowed Brighton’s Alexis Mac Allister to set up March for an easy goal. Reacting to Matip’s error, Merson told Sky Sports (via TBR Football): “It’s a terrible mistake by Matip. And this goal is onside! What a start for Brighton – they deserve it.”
