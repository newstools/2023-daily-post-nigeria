Popular Nigerian musician, Abolore Adegbola Akande, professionally called by his stage name, 9ice has opened up on why he will be voting for the All Progressive Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in the February 25 general election. 9ice, in a recent interview trending on the internet, had stated that Tinubu won his heart when he asked for his phone number after performing at an event. According to the ‘Gongo Aso’ crooner, “while performing at a show, the former governor asked one of his boys to get my number”, and this alone meant a lot to him. He added that “it’s not easy for a person of such repute in a crowded area to pick interest in an artiste, let alone collecting his phone number.” The singer has left social media users in shock with his reason as they pondered on how justifiable this is. 9ice has obviously joined the list of celebrities who have publicly declared support for Tinubu.
