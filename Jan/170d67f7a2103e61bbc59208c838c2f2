Manchester United manager, Erik ten Hag is facing a selection dilemma with Casemiro, as the midfielder could miss Sunday’s clash at Arsenal if he gets a yellow card against Crystal Palace in midweek. Ten Hag is the only manager to defeat the Gunners in the Premier League this season. The Dutchman will be looking to complete the double over the league leaders at the Emirates. United sit nine points adrift of Arsenal ahead of the match, but have a game against Crystal Palace to play before then. If Casemiro is booked at Selhurst Park on Wednesday, it would be his fifth yellow of the season, resulting in a one-match ban. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that Fred, who is in contention to step in if his compatriot is rested, is also one yellow card away from a suspension. One option for Ten Hag could be to rest both players for Palace and start Scott McTominay. Bruno Fernandes could be deployed in a deeper role to the one he occupied against Manchester City on Saturday. The midweek game is the last in which a fifth booking of the season would see a Manchester United player banned – after the midpoint of the season, yellow card suspensions only apply to players with 10 bookings.
