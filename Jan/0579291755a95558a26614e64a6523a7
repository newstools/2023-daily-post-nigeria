Barely few days after some passengers were abducted from a train station in Igueben, Edo State, the same train plying the Warri-Itakpe route is believed to have derailed, forcing many of the passengers to be stranded. According to sources in the train, the incident happened inside Kogi forest, with many of the passengers said to have abandoned the train for fear of being taken hostage. It was gathered that the train which left Warri early on Sunday morning got derailed at about 12 noon inside the thick forest between Ajaokuta and Itakpe. A former Chairman of the Bayelsa Vigilante Agency, Prince Douye Koroye, who was in VIP alleged that it might be a case of suspected terrorists cutting the rail line, a situation that may have culminated in the train derailing because it was at a high speed. The source, who was also former Special Adviser to the Bayelsa State Government on Youth and Community Development, revealed that four coaches and the head coach of the train are badly damaged beyond repair. He said the stranded passengers were told by the officials of the Nigeria Railway Corporation to remain calm and sit back in the train while they mobilised for help. Koroye also revealed that many passengers as at the time of filing this report are still stranded in the Bush and are being protected by the security team in the train.
