UK billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s firm Ineos has officially joined the bidding to buy Manchester United from the Glazer family. A spokesperson for Ineos confirmed the news and told the PA news agency (via the Independent): “We have formally put ourselves into the process.” Man United had officially confirmed in an announcement last November that the club could potentially be put up for sale. The statement explained that the board was considering strategic alternatives, including new investments or a complete sale of the club. The potential sale would see the end of the Glazer family’s 18-year ownership of the Red Devils. They could also look for investment rather than a complete sale of the Premier League giants.
