Legendary Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been hired for a new role in India. The Frenchman will work with the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to improve football in the country. The former Monaco and Arsenal star will also nurture young talent in the country. The 73-year-old, who is currently FIFA’s Chief of Global Football Development, will work with other senior FIFA officials in his team. During the World Cup in Qatar, the former Arsenal boss and officials from FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) met with the AIFF to discuss youth development initiatives in India. The AIFF has created a comprehensive plan, in collaboration with all relevant parties in Indian football along with input from FIFA and the AFC. Wenger and the other FIFA officials will help achieve the Vision 2047, which is to make India a top footballing nation in Asia, establish a strong league in the region, and establish a strong footballing ecosystem. Speaking to Rediff, AIFF President Kaylan Chaubey said, “We have had extensive discussions with the FIFA development team. “Arsene Wenger is head of the FIFA Task Force and they will help us in the grassroots programme. Coaches from Wenger’s team would come.”
