Samuel Gbadamosi, 60, was remanded in Olokuta Correctional Centre on Thursday by a Chief Magistrate Court in Akure, the capital of Ondo State, for allegedly having sex with a minor. Gbadamosi, who was charged with one count of rape, was accused of committing the crime on January 4, 2023, at around 5:30 p.m at Newsite Obasekola Street, Owo. The 16-year-old victim, Miss Jimisola Adenegan, went to pick up a Jamb textbook at her friend’s house when the crime was committed, according to Police Prosecutor Augustine Omhenemhen, who described the incident to the court. According to Section 357 of the Criminal Code, Cap. 37, Volume 1, Laws of Ondo State Nigeria, 2006, the offence is illegal and punishable. However, the defendant entered a plea of not guilty, emphasising that he had no coerced sexual contact with the teenager Jimisola agreed to have sex with him voluntarily, according to Gbadamosi, who claimed he did not force himself on the victim. The prosecution requested that the defendant be held at the Correctional Center while the Director of Public Prosecutions’ office issues its advise. The defendant’s counsel, Amuluru, pleaded with the court to temper justice with mercy and pledged to offer verifiable evidence and sureties. In her ruling, Magistrate O.R. Yakubu mandated that the defendant be kept in custody at Olokuta Correctional Facility pending advice from the DPP. The case was then adjourned until April 27, 2023.
