The Abia State gubernatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Dr Uchechukwu Sampson Ogah has expressed shock over the demise of Professor Uchenna Ikonne. Until his death, Ikonne was the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, candidate in Abia State for the March 11, 2022, governorship election and former Vice Chancellor of Abia State University, Uturu, (ABSU). Ikonne’s demise was confirmed by his son, Chikezie, in a statement he issued on behalf of the family. The statement read, “I regret to announce the death of my dear father, Prof Eleazar Uchenna Ikonne, who died at the National Hospital Abuja today, 25th January, 2023 by 4am after a brief illness. “He was recovering after taking proper treatment in the United Kingdom but relapsed a few days ago leading to multiple cardiac arrests for which he didn’t recover from”. Reacting, Ogah described late Prof. Ikonne as a dear friend and brother, and further grieved that the latter’s death “has created a chasm that will be difficult to fill in the lives of his family, relatives, associates and fervent supporters.” According to him, “indeed, the sudden demise of Prof Ikonne has created a vacuum which has denied Abians and fellow gubernatorial candidates in this current electoral process an opportunity to engage in a high pedestal of espousal and exchange in contemporary ideas and the superiority of same in the quest to entrench a better governance model in Abia State”. While also extolling the virtues of the deceased Abia politician and Professor of Optometry, Ogah condoled Ikonne’s family who he has left behind to continue with his legacy and the Abia chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, praying almighty God in his infinite mercy to grant everyone the fortitude to bear this great loss.
