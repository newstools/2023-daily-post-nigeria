Plateau State’s first-class traditional ruler, the Agwom Izere, His Royal Highness, Dr Isaac Azi Wakili, who was abducted by unknown gunmen on Friday, has been rescued. The Plateau State Command Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Alfred Alabo, in a statement on Friday afternoon, stated that operatives of the command arrested the abductors of the traditional ruler. According to him: “A distress call was received by Angware Police Divisional Headquarters that unknown gunmen forcefully entered the palace of Agwom Izere, and kidnapped him. Police operatives led by the DPO of Angware, SP Timothy Bebissa, immediately raced to the scene to rescue the monarch but were engaged in a gun battle by the gunmen where a yet-to-be-identified civilian guard was shot dead by the kidnappers, and one of the operatives sustained a gunshot injury.” He said Police, other security agencies and volunteer groups strategised, swung into action and rescued the traditional ruler. “Two suspects [connected to] the nefarious act were also arrested,” he said. DSP Alabo further noted that the injured officer had been taken to the hospital while the corpse of the civilian guard had been deposited at the hospital for autopsy, stressing that an investigation was still in progress to arrest other fleeing members of the gang.
