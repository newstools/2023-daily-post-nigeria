Roma boss, Jose Mourinho, has aimed a dig at Chelsea’s €100 million (£88.5m) deal for Mykhailo Mudryk. The Blues struck a deal with Shakhtar Donetsk to pay £62m upfront and a further £26.5m in add-ons, hijacking Arsenal’s bid to sign Mudryk. Chelsea has now spent about £400m under new co-owner Todd Boehly. After using Marash Kumbulla as cover for the suspended Roger Ibanez during their 2-0 win over Fiorentina, Mourinho said: “We need to find a solution, we can’t just buy Mudryk for €100m!” “I worked at clubs with those sorts of practically limitless funds. There are more and more clubs nowadays that fit that profile, but it’s not our profile. We work, we give our all, we work with the characteristics we’ve got.” Mourinho managed Chelsea across two spells, working under former owner Roman Abramovich, who was quick to pay huge transfer fees for players
