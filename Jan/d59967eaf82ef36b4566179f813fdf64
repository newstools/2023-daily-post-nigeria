Zamfara bandit, Gwoska Dankarami again escaped death on New Year’s eve during military airstrikes on his camp. The hideout is along Kaura Namoda road in Zurmi Local Government Area of the state. More than a dozen of Dankarami’s footsoldiers died in the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) bombardment. The shelling was conducted by the Air Component of Operation Hadarin Daji. A military operative told PRNigeria that the location was struck multiple times within some hours. “The operation killed over 16 of his cohorts, destroyed his enclave and newly built house. “Dankarami has not been himself since the strikes at Mutunji village in Dansadau a fortnight ago”, the source added. That operation eliminated over 100 terrorists, including the kingpin’s close associates. NAF Director of Information, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, confirmed Saturday’s raid. Gabkwet said there would be no hiding place for “terrorists and their supporters wherever they may be”.
