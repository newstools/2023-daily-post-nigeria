Former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Wednesday visited former Ogun State governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun. Obasanjo visited Amosun at the Ibara GRA residence of the former governor in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. The visit is coming exactly one month before the February 25, 2023, presidential election. Though it was said that the visit was to congratulate Amosun on his 65th birthday, there are speculations that the duo of Amosun and Obasanjo may be up to something ahead of the 2023 elections. DAILY POST correspondent reports that the visit, which is also the first from Obasanjo to Amosun on his birthday, happened on a day the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, was to campaign in Ogun. A statement by Obasanjo’s media aide, Kehinde Akinyemi, said the former president paid Amosun a visit to felicitate him on his 65th birthday anniversary. According to Akinyemi, Obasanjo was in Amosun’s residence at about 7 am to pray for the celebrant, his wife and his household. DAILY POST reports that Obasanjo is supporting the candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi for the 2023 presidential election. Amosun, an APC member, has vowed to support Tinubu’s presidential ambition, though he was absent during the APC campaign rally in Abeokuta on Wednesday.
