Transition Monitoring Group (TMG) has urged Nigerians to collect their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) ahead of the 2023 election. The Chairman, Auwal Musa Rafsanjani said the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) already fixed January 22 as the deadline. INEC recently announced that 6.7 million PVCs have not been claimed in 17 States and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). TMG said the voter apathy witnessed in previous elections must not be allowed to repeat itself in February and March. Rafsanjani told citizens to show interest in the electoral process and be instrumental to the formation of a better Nigeria. “No one should wait until the rush hour; the time is now”, the activist said. “Electing leaders is our responsibility that no one can deny anyone but without PVC, that right will be denied.” TMG advised the electorate to be wary of desperate politicians who would want to bribe them in exchange for their voter cards. The statement further charged Nigerians to “stand their feet” during the general polls. Rafsanjani hailed INEC for extending the period for PVCs collection and moving the cards from state offices to local government areas and wards.
