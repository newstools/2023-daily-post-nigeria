Spokesperson for the Labour Party presidential campaign council, Kenneth Okonkwo has lauded the party’s presidential candidate for the February election, Peter Obi over his performance at the Chatham House in United Kingdom. DAILY POST reports that like other presidential candidates including the flagbearer of the All Progressives Congress, APC Bola Tinubu, Obi was at the Chatham House on Monday where he spoke on his plans for the country if elected president next month. Reacting to Obi’s performance, Kenneth Okonkwo, a famous movie star said the former Anambra Governor projected Nigeria as a pride of the black race and the giant of Africa. The actor who stated this on Channels Television’s politics today programme, said Obi was so stingy at the Chatham House that he could not delegate questions to his allies. He said, “I’m so proud of my principal who was so stingy that he went to Chatham House and refuse to share questions; he was answering the questions, in contradiction to the generous APC candidate who went there and shared the questions for other people to answer.”
