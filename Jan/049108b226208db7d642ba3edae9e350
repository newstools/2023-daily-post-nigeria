The Spiritual Director of the Adoration Ministry Enugu, Rev Father Ejike Mbaka has revealed that Nigeria is under a curse. Mbaka said Nigeria is cursed with bad leadership. Delivering his first sermon at the Adoration ground on Friday, Mbaka said God has blessed Nigeria with everything despite the curse. “Nigeria is blessed with everything but cursed with bad leadership,” he said. On his return from the monastery abroad, the priest said 2023 is a year of favour and prayed that his congregation would not labour in vain. Recall that the outspoken Catholic priest was moved out of the Adoration ministry following his suspension. Most Rev Callistus Onaga, the Catholic Bishop of Enugu Diocese, suspended Fr. Mbaka on June 3, 2022, over some political comments.
