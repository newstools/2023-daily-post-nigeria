Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has predicted that the chances of All Progressives Congress(APC) winning the presidential poll is not feasible. Pastor Giwa, while addressing his congregation in Akure, the Ondo State capital on Sunday, said it could probably happen when Nigerians decide to feign ignorance by going to sleep. Pastor Giwa is famed for being critical of the APC-led Federal Government, especially in relation to insecurity and the economy. He cautioned the electorates to guard against selling their voting rights for peanuts. According to him, Nigerians are not lost on how President Muhammadu Buhari-led government and his party had plunged the nation into its current economic comatose. Giwa stated: “We have not forgotten how they lied to us that they would make naira equal in value to the dollar, but failed to actualize it. They promised our children scholarships, but they ended up closing our higher institutions for almost a year. Most of their policies have turned married women and young ladies into prostitutes. You can’t imagine how Yahoo boys have taken over the streets of Nigeria due to the failure of the current government to provide jobs. “APC can only return to power again if Nigerians are sleeping. Let me advise you to get your PVC ready and vote out this ruling party”. Pastor Giwa’s reactions comes just as the electoral umpire, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) recently took delivery of its last batch of BVAS machines, which it hopes to deploy massively in the conduct of the general elections slated to kick off in February this year.
