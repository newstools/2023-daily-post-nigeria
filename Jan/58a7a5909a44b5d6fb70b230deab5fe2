The gubernatorial candidate of the Accord Party in Oyo State, Adebayo Adelabu has said he is not stepping down for any of the gubernatorial candidates in the state. Adelabu, a former Deputy Governor, Operations of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) made this disclosure on Saturday. He spoke through the Director General of the Accord Campaign Council, Adegboyega Adegoke. Adegoke in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Saturday, debunked the news allegedly peddled by the gubernatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Teslim Folarin that Adelabu has stepped down for him. He said Adelabu will not step down for Folarin or any other gubernatorial candidates through a coalition. Adegoke alleged that the same fraudulent tactics were used during the APC primaries which made the founding leaders and members of the APC in the state leave the party. Adegoke maintained that the people of the state are already aware of the antics of some politicians which cannot take them anywhere in the 2023 general elections. He added that there was no time when Adelabu held any meetings with Folarin on a coalition. Adegoke said, “It has come to our notice that the APC gubernatorial candidate in Oyo state, Senator Teslim Folarin has started his antics again, peddling lies and deceptions that the candidate of our party, Accord, Chief Adebayo Adelabu will be leading a coalition in his favour. “We want to bring it to the notice of the good people of Oyo State that there was no time Chief Adebayo Adelabu held any meetings with Senator Folarin on Coalition. This was another lie from a political schizophrenic, whose political career was built on falsehood and manipulations. “Chief Adebayo Adelabu is contesting to win the gubernatorial election in Oyo state under Accord”.
