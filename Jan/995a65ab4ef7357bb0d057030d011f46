Some youths at the Anambra rally of the All Progressives Congress, APC have ambushed and broken open a bus carrying snacks meant to be distributed to party members. The youths are reported to be among those who gathered to welcome the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu DAILY POST reports that the youths were milling around the bus, begging to be given the Gala sausages which were parked in cartons in a 608 bus. Some officials of the party in charge of the snacks were about to start sharing them, when a huge crowd of irate youths surged, causing them to shut the door of the bus while the driver drove off. The youths, however, chased down the bus, broke open the back door and helped themselves to cartons upon cartons of gala snacks. The driver who was oblivious to the fact that the bus had been broken into, kept driving while the content of his bus was totally plundered by the ‘hungry youths’. One of the youths who refused to disclose his name and had gotten as much as four cartons of the gala sausage said: “I wish it was Tinubu’s bullion van that opened like that for us to help ourselves.” Video:
