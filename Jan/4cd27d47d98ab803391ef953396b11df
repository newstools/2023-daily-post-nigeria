Taiwo Awoniyi will miss Nottingham Forest’s Premier League clash against Leicester City, according to manager Steve Cooper. Awoniyi has missed the Reds last two games across all competitions as a result of injury. The 25-year-old sustained the injury in Nottingham Forest’s 1-0 away win against Southampton at the St Mary’s Stadium earlier this month. The Nigeria international scored the decisive goal in the thrilling encounter. Forest will host Leicester City at the City Ground on Saturday. “Taiwo didn’t make it for this one(against Leicester City),” Cooper was quoted by Nottingham Post. “We’re working away with him for the weekend. We’ve got our fingers crossed on that one.” Awoniyi is the club’s top scorer with four goals in 16 league appearances.
