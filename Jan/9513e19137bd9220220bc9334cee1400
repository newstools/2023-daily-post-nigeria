The National Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, SDP, Alhaji Shehu Musa Gabam, on Wednesday asserted that the party remains the only avenue to rescue Nigeria from insecurity, poverty, industrialization and unending meaningless borrowing. Gabam also urged Nigerians to vote massively for the party’s presidential candidate and others vying for various positions in the 2023 general elections on the platform to redeem the image of the country. He made the call during the commissioning of the SDP ultra-modern party secretariat in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital. Represented by the National Vice Chairman, South-South, Mr Frederick Owoturofa, he said SDP is the best option to address insecurity, poverty and the unending meaningless borrowing and therefore deserving of support and votes for its presidential candidate and others who can change the narratives in this country. He urged the various stakeholders to think SDP all the time for change to be effected. The governorship candidate of the party in Rivers State, Senator Magnus Abe, encouraged party members and other stakeholders not to see themselves as grasshoppers but as giants in the eyes of the people to take the country to a desirable height. He said they may be few but in the end, victory is sure, noting that the storm is a sign of victory. A candidate of Ogbia Federal Constituency, Hon. Iworiso Markson, speaking on behalf of the candidates, vowed that they will not let the party down, adding that “our winning will pave the way for a governor from our party.” The State Chairman of the party, Hon. Allen Amadein said the commissioning of the ultra-modern party secretariat symbolised a new face of victory. He said the journey to where they are today started four years ago and has not been an easy one. The party, he said, is peaceful and without rival factions and therefore has a unified mandate to work for the party.
