The Big Brother Titans, BBTitans housemate, Yaya has berated her fellow housemate, Mmeli, over his sexual encounter with Nelisa. Mmeli and Nelisa were said to have had sex after they were spotted kissing and cuddling. Nelisa was seen picking condoms for him in a viral clip on social media. Mmeli appeared to have been avoiding Nelisa since the sexual encounter, prompting Yaya to confront him. Expressing her disappointment during a chat with Nmeli, Yaya said he was wrong to have ignored Nelisa after sleeping with her. “You are wrong for sleeping with that girl and treating her the way you are treating her right now. She is someone’s child, you shouldn’t have slept with her, you are wrong. And I’m disappointed in the way you’re handling the situation. ”I’m not saying you should chase after her, but the way you are going about it is what I don’t approve of.” Recall that Nelisa had earlier, during their truth-or-dare game, admitted that she is attracted to Mmeli.
