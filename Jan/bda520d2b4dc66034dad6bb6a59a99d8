Famous Nollywood actor, Anayo Modestus Onyekwere popularly known as Kanayo O. Kanayo has called on Nigerians of Igbo extraction scattered across the country not to return to the Southeast during the elections. Kanayo in a video currently making the rounds on social media alleged that the rumour of war and attacks being expected to occur during the presidential poll was orchestrated to instil fear in Igbo people to force their return to their various states. According to him, staying put in whichever state the Igbos are would ensure at least 25 percent votes for the Labour Party presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi in all 36 states. He said, “I’m making this post as a member of the presidential campaign council of the Labour Party targeted at Igbos across Nigeria. “We have to preach to Igbos who stay outside Southeastern Nigeria to stay put wherever they reside. All these rumours of wars and attacks are just to put fear in Igbos to leave where they are and that is not going to work. “They want Igbos to flee to the East and return after the elections. Do not make any attempt to leave where you are because that is a design to reduce our numbers, we don’t have to die many times before our deaths, only a fool does. “Death will come when it will but nobody is going to die. Staying put where we are is the only way 25 percent of votes across the country will be guaranteed for our brother Peter Obi”.
