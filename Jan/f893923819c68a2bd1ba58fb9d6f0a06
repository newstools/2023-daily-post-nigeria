The Labour Party has said former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s endorsement of Peter Obi is a move by Obasanjo to correct past mistakes as president. The South-South National Vice Chairman of the Labour Party, Felix Reuben made the observation in an interview on Wednesday. Reuben also faulted those criticizing Obi for associating with former leaders of the country who they have accused of running the country aground. He noted that Obi’s association with Obasanjo will enable him to learn some lessons to equip him for the job ahead. He said: “ Today I want to say that Obasanjo is correcting any mistake he had made. He has seen that when he was president there were certain things he couldn’t do. “He has seen that Peter Obi can do better than he did and the best thing for him to do as a statesman is to endorse and work for this man.” The Labour Party leader called on every other leader including governors to join in endorsing Obi for the future of the country.
