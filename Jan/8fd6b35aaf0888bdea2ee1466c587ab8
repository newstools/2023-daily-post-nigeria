The All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, on Monday vowed to ensure the actualisation of the much-awaited Ibom Deep Seaport to boost economic activities in the state. Tinubu said Akwa Ibom people wouldn’t suffer again, adding that the state was blessed with enormous water resources to support the establishment of a deep seaport in the state. The former Lagos State governor stated this when he addressed a mammoth crowd at the presidential campaign rally at Godswill Akpabio International Stadium Uyo. He said, “We’ll do mechanised farming. We’ll export food from Akwa Ibom. “We’ll build your Deep Seaport. I have completed the Lekki Deep Seaport in Lagos. “Akwa Ibom people will not suffer again. Nigerians will not suffer again.”
