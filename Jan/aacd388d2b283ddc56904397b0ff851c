A former Governor of Adamawa State, Murtala Nyako, says Nigeria is in such a precarious situation that change for the better has become a must. “The situation is so bad, nobody needs to stress that we need a change; we certainly need improvement of the situation of this country now,” Nyako said. Nyako, who was governor between 2007 and 2014 first under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and later All Progressives Congress (APC), made his remark on Saturday in the state capital, Yola. Addressing newsmen shortly after playing host to the APC governorship candidate in the state, Senator Aishatu Ahmed Binani, at his residence, Nyako said Adamawa and Nigeria as a whole must move away from the state of backwardness that currently characterises the people. “We need a greater Adamawa, we need a greater Nigeria; we need to relieve our people of the level of poverty they are in,” he said. The elder statesman refrained from blaming anybody but insisted that reviving Nigeria requires people of goodwill. “We need people who can mobilise us to move forward. We have to put our heads together, all of us,” he said. The visit to Nyako and the former governor’s apparent warm reception for her was read as a huge endorsement for Binani who faces incumbent Governor Ahmadu Fintiri in the March 11 governorship election. Nyako’s legacy is similarly expected to work well for his biological son, Senator Abdulaziz Nyako, who holds APC’s senatorial ticket for Adamawa Central Zone.
