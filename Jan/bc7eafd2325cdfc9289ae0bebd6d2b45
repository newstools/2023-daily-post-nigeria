On Monday, Public Relations Officer, SP Benjamin Hundeyin said all personnel have been relocated. The officers would be replaced with their colleagues from other divisions. “The Commissioner of Police, CP Abiodun Alabi has already effected the transfer all personnel of the division. “This would fully materialize in a couple of days”, Hundeyin disclosed. The spokesperson also confirmed the new Ajah Divisional Police Officer (DPO), CSP Adolf Ogwu has dismantled all the shanties around the station. The Lagos command, however, urged citizens to “say something whenever they see something”.
