ADC stated this in a statement by its National Vice Chairman South East, Chilos Godsent, in Owerri, the state capital which condemned the unprovoked and barbaric attack on the home of the spokesperson of Coalition of United Political Parties, CUPP, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere. The statement reads: “African Democratic Congress (ADC) South East Zone, therefore, challenges the ruling All Progressive Congress-led government of Imo State to rise up to its responsibility to properly address the increasing state of insecurity in Imo State and stop toying with the lives of people in the State. ” The Insecurity in Imo State has caused [a] heavy decline in business and economic activities in the state thereby making life very difficult for the residents of the State. “We can not continue to watch while people are being slaughtered like chickens on a daily basis in Imo and South East by extension. “ADC calls on the leadership of the Nigerian Police Force to immediately rebuild all the Divisional Police Stations that were destroyed by the criminal activities of gunmen as that may help to boost the security of life and properties in the South East Region. “
