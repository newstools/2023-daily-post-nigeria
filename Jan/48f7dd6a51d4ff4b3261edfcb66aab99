Ecology and Marine Rights Organisation coordinator, Musa Saidu has cautioned against interference in the probe of Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele. Saidu told the News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, that attacks on the DSS over alleged N70trillion looted funds and hidden in banks was unnecessary. The activist noted that the agency was doing its job and “as ordered by the President without partiality”. Emefiele remains a public officer entrusted with the public property and can be investigated, Saidu stressed. He said the CBN chief faces allegations including diversion of revenue funds, diversion of agricultural loans and fraudulent practices in Forex transactions. “The DSS investigation on the CBN governor is lawful and should be cherished by any patriotic Nigerian”, he said. Saidu condemned “the sponsored campaign”, noting that such “is a sabotage and subversive to state affairs”. He expressed belief in the rule of law and charged security agencies to “arrest whoever is found wanting in government”.
