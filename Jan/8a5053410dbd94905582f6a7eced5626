Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has cautioned those criticising Liverpool striker, Darwin Nunez. According to Ferdinand, it is too soon to judge the struggling striker, who joined the Reds in a record deal of around £85million from Benfica last summer. Ferdinand compared the Uruguayan to former Manchester United teammate, Diego Forlan. Nunez so far has struggled to live up to his price tag, scoring nine goals and producing three assists in 21 appearances. He has been criticised for missing big chances, particularly in the recent defeat to Manchester City in the Carabao Cup. But Ferdinand believes that the 23-year-old can develop into a great goalscorer and follow in the footsteps of fellow Uruguayan Forlan. “You’ve got to be careful when you talk about people like Nunez,” the United legend said on the FIVE podcast. “Remember Diego Forlan? Apart from a goal against the Scousers, he couldn’t hit a barn door at Old Trafford,” he added. Rio Ferdinand recalled that Forlan went on to win a European Golden Shoe twice and become a legend for his national team and the various clubs he played for after leaving Manchester United. Darwin Nunez fired blank on Monday night as Jurgen Klopp’s Reds fell 3-1 in the hands of Brentford.
