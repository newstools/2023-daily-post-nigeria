Arsenal legend Paul Merson has told Manchester United they cannot beat the Gunners without their midfielder Casemiro. According to him, the best result the Red Devils would get without the Brazilian at the Emirates on Sunday is a draw. League leaders Arsenal welcome Erik ten Hag’s men at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday with 6 points separating them. Before the Emirates showdown later in the evening, Manchester City would have closed the gap to Mikel Arteta’s side to just two points with a victory over Wolves in the early kickoff. Midfield linchpin Casemiro was suspended at Crystal Palace in midweek after a reckless tackle on Wilfried Zaha in their 1-1 draw. Merson told Sky Sports: “He[Casemiro]is massive for them. “He would’ve looked after Odegaard, Casemiro. I don’t see, I cannot see Man Utd beating Arsenal without Casemiro. “They might get a draw. I don’t see that without Casemiro, he’s that highly rated by me. I don’t give Man United much of a chance tomorrow.”
