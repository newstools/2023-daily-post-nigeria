British broadcaster, Piers Morgan, has blasted Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag for forcing Cristiano Ronaldo out of Old Trafford and replacing him with a 30-year-old attacker, Wout Weghorst. Ronaldo left Man United after his contract was mutually terminated following his interview with Morgan last year. In the interview, Ronaldo slammed Man United and claimed he had been disrespected. This left the Red Devils without a forward until the loan signing of Weghorst from Burnley. Following Arsenal’s Premier League 3-2 win over Man United on Sunday, Morgan took aim at ten Hag for “forcing” Ronaldo out of the club as he labelled the Dutchman as “arrogant.” Morgan tweeted: “Congrats Manchester United – that is what happens when you hire an arrogant coach who disrespects the GOAT Cristiano Ronaldo so badly he leaves. And then replace him with someone I’ve never heard of who sounds like an Austrian sausage.” After leaving Man United, Ronaldo joined Saudi Arabia club Al-Nassr on a £175 million-per-year deal.
