Former Manchester United striker, Michael Owen has slammed Liverpool’s summer signing, Darwin Nunez, saying the Uruguayan is making so many mistakes. According to Owen, the 24-year-old striker is behaving as if he is not being coached as his woes in front of goal continues. The South American has made an underwhelming start to his career at Anfield as he struggles for goals. Nunez joined Jurgen Klopp’s Reds from Benfica in a club-record £85 million deal, last summer. He scored 48 goals in 85 games at the Estadio da Luiz before switching to Anfield “IHe makes so many mistakes. I can’t believe he is so raw, at the moment,” Owen told Premier League Productions. “It looks like he has hardly been coached a lot of the time throughout his career. I think Liverpool can coach him in the right way and get some experience.”
