A former President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Olisa Agbakoba, says the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, lacks constitutional backing to query states’ accounts. Agbakoba made this disclosure on Thursday in Lagos State. He stated that the National Assembly had not amended section 214(1) of the constitution of Nigeria’s federal republic, a legal instrument establishing the Nigeria Police Force to incorporate EFCC’s function. “So the question is if the federal government creates the EFCC, can it then prosecute state offences? “The Supreme Court, in many of its decisions, has held that federalism means two autonomous and independent governments and, if that is correct, the EFCC lacks the right to go to the state and examine their accounts,” he said.
