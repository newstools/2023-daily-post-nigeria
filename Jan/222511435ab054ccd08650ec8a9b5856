Over 1, 000 residents of Taura Local Government Area in Jigawa State have benefited from free medical outreach and relief materials. The National President of the Young Medical Professionals of Nigeria, YOMPON, Dr Musa Abdurrahman Hassan stated this while speaking at the launch of the programme held in Taura PHC. He said the programme was organized in collaboration with Wali Foundation to give back to society. According to him, the medical outreach was aimed at reducing the suffering of people in the area who are finding it difficult to access healthcare services, especially those displaced by the flood. The medical outreach, as he outlined, includes free medical screening, free medical consultation, public health education, counselling and free supply of drugs. Some of the beneficiaries who commended the organizers for considering the community said the exercise had given the people of the area the opportunity to benefit from medical services, especially those who cannot afford medical bills.
