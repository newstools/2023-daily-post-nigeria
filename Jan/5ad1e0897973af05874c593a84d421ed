DAILY POST learnt that police on duty sighted some persons being dragged into the bush and responded promptly. The Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe, in a statement confirmed: “The operatives suspected that they may have been kidnapped, so they trailed them into the bush.
