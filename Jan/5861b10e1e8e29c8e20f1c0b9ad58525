Enugu Rangers are happy to play at the Awka City Stadium, according to the club’s secretary, Ferdinand Ugwuarua. The Flying Antelopes have been directed to play on the ground by the Interim Management Committee {IMC) after their original home ground, the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Stadium, Enugu was not deemed suitable to host matches by the IMC. The popular Nnamdi Azikwe Stadium is currently undergoing renovation works. Ugwuarua stated that the team will adapt to the environment and put up a solid showing in the 2022/23 Nigeria Premier Football League season. “No doubt, we would have loved to play before our numerous supporters and followers in Enugu at the Nnamdi Azikiwe stadium but with the renovation works yet to be completed, we have to move to Awka where we also enjoy large followership, “he told the club’s media. The Coal City club will entertain Abia Warriors in their opening game of the season on Sunday in Awka.
