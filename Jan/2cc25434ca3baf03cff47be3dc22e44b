Accord Party (AP) presidential candidate, Prof. Christopher Imumolen said he would adopt the principle of all-inclusiveness in selecting his cabinet if he becomes Nigeria’s president. Imumolen noted that to build an economically sound country where every Nigerian would be proud of, he would solicit the help of the best brains in different fields to conbtribute their quota. “The task of rebuilding our country is an onerous one. It is not going to be a one-man show. Every one who has the idea, capacity to add value to governance, no matter their background or party affiliations, shall be called upon to do so,” he said on Sunday. “For his adeptness and aptitude as a businessman of no mean standing, I will appoint Peter Obi as my minister of trade and commerce, while Asiwaju Bola Tinubu will serve as an adviser, most probably on the political front for obvious reasons. “You will agree with me that these men will most be suitable in the roles I have earlier mentioned because of their track records in both their private and public lives. “The move is meant to demonstrate that we are all partners in progress in our desire to see our country regain it’s lost glory, as well as deliver to it’s millions of citizens the true dividends of democracy. “The move is also meant to send the message that appointments will only be given to those who merit it in the kind of reformist government we are planning to run. “The concept of square pegs in square holes shall be the guiding principles of our government under the umbrella of Accord, the party that preaches oneness and togetherness,” Imumolen added.
