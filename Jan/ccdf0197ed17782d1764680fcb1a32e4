Football transfer expert Alex Crook has given an update on Manchester United’s move for Christian Eriksen’s replacement. Eriksen is expected to be sidelined for at least four months following a terrible injury he sustained during Manchester United’s 3-1 win in the FA Cup on Friday. The Red Devils have now made a surprise move for Bayern Munich midfielder Marcel Sabitzer as a replacement for the Denmark International. Speaking on the development, talkSPORT pundit and transfer expert said, “There’s always a curveball on deadline day. All the noise coming out of Man United was no more business. “But now with the Eriksen news, they need another body in midfield and Ten Hag is really driving this deal for Sabitzer. It hasn’t worked out at Bayern and they’re not blocking his exit. “It would be a loan, possibly with an option to buy. They have eight and a half hours to get it done, it’s not a formality.”
