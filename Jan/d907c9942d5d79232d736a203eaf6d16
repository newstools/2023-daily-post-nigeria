The chairman of All Progressives Congress, APC, Ebonyi State and special security consultant to the state government, Chief Stanley Okoro Emegha has said he did not provoke shootings in Ekoli Edda, Afikpo South Local Government Area of the state. DAILY POST recalls that the alleged shooting in the area resulted in the killing of his younger brother and his houses and vehicles set ablaze by unknown gunmen. A policeman and a youth leader were also killed when the thugs struck. Emegha described, as wicked, false and mischievous, the reports in some sections of the media that he was blowing sirens and shooting sporadically which provoked the killings. He wondered why he was linked to the shootings in the community which started in Ameke village in the area where he went to inspect a town hall he was building for the people after receiving traditional rulers and elders of the community. He opined that the traditional rulers have absolved him of the shootings before the governor, David Umahi. The APC chairman, however, expressed confidence in the security agencies in the state, who he said will unravel the truth and bring perpetrators of the mayhem to book. Emegha also applauded Governor David Umahi for his quick intervention and peaceful leadership which he said prevented the crisis from escalating. According to him: “I was there inspecting the building when I started hearing gunshots. As a peaceful person and a man under grace, I ordered security personnel that were with me not to respond to the shootings because it will lead to many things which I will not like; they obeyed me and we left the community immediately.” A reliable source who spoke anonymously said a bullet from the thugs would have killed him, if not that he dodged it. According to the source: “What happened in Ameke, Ekoli Edda on 26th December 2022 was a clear assassination attempt on myself and the state APC Chairman.”
