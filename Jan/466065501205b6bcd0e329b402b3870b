Former Governor of Ogun State Gbenga Daniel has decried the neglect of the state’s natural resources in Ogun Waterside Local Government which he claimed are yet to be utilised by both the state and federal governments. Daniel said there is an urgent need for government at all levels to harness the vast natural resources lying fallow in Ogun Waterside, saying the local government has enough economic potential when utilised. The former governor spoke on Friday at Abigi, the headquarters of Ogun Waterside Local Government, during his ward-to-ward campaign tour. Daniel is the senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Ogun East, comprising the nine local governments in Ijebu and Remo. Addressing his supporters, the APC candidate recalled “the various efforts” he made during his reign as Ogun governor to “initiate projects of immense economic value to the state in particular and the nation at large.” Daniel listed the Olokola Free Trade Zone project which includes OK LNG, the Deep Sea Port and the Gateway Industrial Petro-Gas Institute (GIPI). He said: “When we initiated these projects, it was because we knew that this local government has the deepest seaport in Nigeria that could accommodate very large ocean liners without needing dredging. “There is also a vast deposit of bitumen on our border with Ondo State. Without doubt, the economic future of Ogun State, and even Nigeria, lies in this great local government and our job in Abuja will be to drag the Federal Government to revisit and accelerate the projects.” Daniel began a tour of the local government on Monday, meeting residents, party faithful, community leaders and other critical stakeholders. The campaign train visited all the 10 wards of the local government to canvass votes for APC and all its candidates.
