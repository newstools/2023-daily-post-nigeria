With less than six months to the end of his tenure, President Muhammadu Buhari has promised to serve Nigerians to the best of his ability. Buhari made the promise while paying homage to the Emir of Bauchi, Rilwanu Adamu, on Monday. The president is in Bauchi State for the APC Presidential campaign rally. Buhari recalled visiting all the local governments of Nigeria, where he promised to serve the country. “In 2003 and 2012, I visited all the 774 local government areas in this country, and in 2019 when I was contesting for the second term, I visited all the states. “So, there, I made the promise and the pledge that I will serve Nigeria and Nigerians to the best of my ability,” he said. Speaking, Adamu commended Buhari for his visit while appealing to politicians to eschew bitterness in politics. Buhari was accompanied by the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, the Senate President Ahmed Lawan, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila.
