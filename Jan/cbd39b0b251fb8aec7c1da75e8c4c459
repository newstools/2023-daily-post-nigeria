Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers on Friday opened up on endorsing the Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate, Peter Obi. Wike said his comment that Obi was presidential material does not mean he endorsed the LP presidential candidate. Speaking with BBC Pidgin, the governor said: “If I tell Obi that he is a presidential material, does that mean an endorsement?” In 2022, Wike played host to the former Anambra State governor, a situation that led to speculations that he may endorse Obi. Despite being a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Wike is yet to endorse his presidential candidate. Wike and the G-5 governors are aggrieved with PDP leadership, hence their refusal to endorse the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar.
