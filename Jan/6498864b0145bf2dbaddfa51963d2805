A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Femi Fani-Kayode said there will never be peace between his party and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, henceforth. The former Minister of Aviation was reacting to a video circulating online depicting so-called APC decampees burning clothes with printed image of its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, under the supervision of Senator Dino Melaye, a spokesperson to the PDP Presidential Campaign Council. Fani-Kayode’s statement was contained in a statement via his verified Twitter handle on Sunday. He claimed Senator Melaye had burnt APC before the world. He wrote, “This show of shame took place in Atiku Abubakar’s Abuja home. You call us satan and you burn us before the world? How can there be peace between us after this?”
