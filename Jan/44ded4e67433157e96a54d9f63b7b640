The Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige has said federal civil servants will start getting their allowances paid in full by January as soon as President Muhammadu Buhari okays the payment. Ngige disclosed this during an interaction with journalists on Thursday. He reiterated that contrary to speculations, the federal government is not proposing salary increments for civil servants but rather a full allowance payment. He added that paying the allowances to the federal civil servants becomes essential as part of measures to reduce the harsh economic effect. “Contrary to speculations that the Federal Government was proposing a salary increase for civil servants, the actual position was that it would pay the federal civil servants’ allowances in full as soon as Buhari approved the payment,” he said.
