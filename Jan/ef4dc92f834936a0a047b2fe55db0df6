The Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, on Saturday appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to direct the payment of all withheld salaries of university workers in the country. The NLC President, Mr Ayuba Wabba, made the appeal in a resolution reached at the end of the National Administrative Council (NAC) of the congress in Abuja. Recall that because of the “No Work, No Pay’’ policy of the Federal Government, the salaries of members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, and others were withheld for the duration they were on strike. Wabba said, “We urged President Muhammadu Buhari, as a mark of goodwill, to direct the payment of all withheld salaries of university workers. “The affected university workers are finding it difficult to cope with the prevailing economic challenges in the country.‘’ Wabba insisted that the review was imperative given the considerably weakened value of the Naira against other currencies in the world.
