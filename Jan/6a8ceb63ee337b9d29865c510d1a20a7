Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State has cancelled the charging of levies by Parent Teachers’ Associations (PTAs) of public schools. The Governor said on Monday that such levies ran against his government’s free education policy. The Governor who spoke at the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Secretariat in Yola where he addressed CAN officials and church leaders from across the state, stressed that he could not condone PTA levies when his government is running a free education scheme. He said, “Education is free here. I can’t tolerate a situation now where PTAs fix charges. We came to relieve parents of the burden of paying fees and we don’t want anything that sounds like fees by some other name.” The Governor said he was taking steps to stop the indiscriminate charging of levies under whatever guise because it runs contrary to his free education programme. Governor Ahmadu Fintiri who was at the CAN Secretariat for interaction with the CAN officials and other Christian leaders, said his measures to assuring security for all have improved religious harmony, among other things. Speaking earlier during the event, the state chairman of CAN, Bishop Dami Mamza, said Christians in the state were committed to the unity and development of the state. Mamza, also the Catholic Bishop of Yola, said, “CAN has the vision of a just and prosperous state where everyone will enjoy equity. We seek the building of a better Adamawa State for the good of all.”
