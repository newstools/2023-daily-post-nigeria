Former West Ham United striker, Frank McAvennie has hit out at Manchester United forward, Anthony Martial, saying the France star should be “embarrassed” as the club is looking to sign new strikers in the January transfer window. According to McAvennie, Martial should have been well established at Man United by now, having been at Old Trafford since 2015. Martial has blown hot and cold during his time at Man United over the years since joining the Premier League giants over seven years ago. Man United manager, Erik ten Hag, is keen to sign a striker this January to bolster his attacking line in the second half of the season. And McAvennie believes Man United should not have been in such a situation and that Martial should have been consistent enough to earn Ten Hag’s trust. McAvennie told Football Insider: “You have got to put in the effort and commitment every week, you cannot do it just when you decide. He has been there long enough now, he should be well established. “The manager should not even be looking for forwards. I would be embarrassed if I were him.” He added, “Martial should be making the manager’s decision that he doesn’t need to go and get a top striker, but he hasn’t done it.”
