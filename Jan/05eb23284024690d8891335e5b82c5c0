The Youth wing of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has said elections will be held in the South-East zone. The group’s stand was made against an earlier statement by Finland-based Simon Ekpa. Leader of the IPOB youth wing, Comrade Ndubuisi Igwekani, aka Agu Biafra, told journalists in Enugu on Tuesday that the Biafra group would not interfere in the election process, stressing that the will of the Nigerian youths would be respected. “It is Nigerians that brought Peter Obi out, and their goal is genuine, to recover Nigeria. “If they have chosen Peter Obi, South-East cannot be the stumbling block. We cannot be seen as the problem,” he said. Igwekani urged Ekpa to withdraw any order against peaceful conduct of elections in the South-East if he is truly in the struggle. He disclosed that a committee had been set up to monitor security situations in the South-East States to identify those responsible for the killings. “We will also set up a security network to monitor their activities to ensure that all criminals hiding under the Biafra struggle to commit crimes are fished out and handed over to security agents. “If Simon Ekpa is on our own side, if he is really fighting for freedom and shows he is not part of the killings in the South-East, he must withdraw orders against election in the South. “Enough of bloodshed in the South-East. We want to know those behind the killings and expose them. “We can’t allow continued killings in the name of the Biafra struggle. The struggle is about emancipation of our people not to kill them. “We also warn the Government that Nnamdi Kanu must be released before the election. A man who came to salvage his people was put in detention. He must be released. “We are in talks with genuine men of God, genuine traditional rulers and genuine politicians to make sure that nothing happens to the IPOB leader. Because it will not augur well with this country if anything happens to him,” he warned.
