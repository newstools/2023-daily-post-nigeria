Popular Nigerian social activist and skit maker Debo Adebayo, better known as Mr Macaroni, has called on Nigerians to be wary of politicians offering money in exchange for votes. Mr Macaroni’s admonition was contained in a post via his verified Twitter handle on Tuesday. According to him, politicians offering money in exchange for votes are not going to serve Nigerians but are only investing. He also said the nation’s treasury rightfully belongs to the people. He wrote, “Any politician offering you money in exchange for your vote is not going to serve you. They are only investing. If they get into office, they will loot the Nation’s treasury which rightfully belongs to the people. “Do not vote in thieves and looters! “They are destroyers.”
