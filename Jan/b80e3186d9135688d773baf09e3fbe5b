Falana who was a guest on Politics Today, a Channels TV program claimed Emefiele has silently been declared wanted over terrorism financing allegations. He lamented that such action can only happen in a ‘banana republic’. Falana while responding to interview questions said, “I can say without any fear that Mr Godwin Emefiele is not in Nigeria but he has been quietly declared wanted by the State Security Services. “This can only happen in a Banana republic where the CBN Governor would be accused of a grave offence, which is terrorism financing,” he said. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor faces allegations of terrorism financing, diversion of revenue, agricultural loans and fraudulent practices in Forex transactions and had failed to show up at the National Assembly to explain the reason behind the naira redesign and cash withdrawal limits.
