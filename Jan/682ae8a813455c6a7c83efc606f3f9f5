Al-Nassr have failed to register Cristiano Ronaldo for his debut on Thursday. This is because the club have exceeded their limit for non-Saudi Arabian players in their squad. Ronaldo was officially unveiled earlier this week after signing a £ 175 million-a-year deal. Al-Nassr were scheduled to play Al-Ta’ee, before the game was moved following heavy rainfall in Riyadh. Ronaldo is also currently serving a two-game ban from the Football Association after he slapped a mobile phone out of the hands of a young Everton fan last April. He may now face a long wait to make his first appearance for his new club, as they would need to reorganise their squad to accommodate the 37-year-old. Al-Nassr currently have eight foreign players in their squad, which is the maximum allowed under the rules of the Saudi league.
