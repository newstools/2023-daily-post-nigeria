The So-Safe Corps in Ogun State have arrested 10 citizens of Niger Republic in Ihunbo, Ipokia Local Government Area of Ogun State. The Nigeriens, who are all male adults, were arrested on Sunday by operatives of the corps. The corps spokesperson, Moruf Yusuf, told DAILY POST in a statement on Wednesday that the foreigners had penetrated into Nigeria through illegal routes and were caught by the Idiroko divisional team of the corps, who were on routine patrol. Yusuf said that the Nigeriens confessed that they successfully made their way into the country through the water and thick forest in the Ipokia Local Government axis. Their mission, they claimed, was to engage in farming in Ita-Egbe village. The corps gave the name of the foreigners as Yusuf Mohammed, Nura Abdullahi, Afisu Dairu, Gafar Abdulmumeen, Abubakar Subair, Amisu Nasiru, Illiasu Yahyah, Ibrahim Audu, Suraju Ibrahim and Mohammed Garuba, who was identified as the team leader. He added that the arrested persons had been transferred to the Ogun State Command of the Nigeria Immigration Service for further investigation and likely repatriation. He advised the public to be concerned about anything that could negate the security of lives and properties in the environment and therefore report to the So-Safe Corps and other law enforcement agencies for necessary actions.
