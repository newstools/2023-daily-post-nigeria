Lionel Messi’s father, Jorge, is believed to be in Riyadh to hold talks with Al-Hilal over the possibility of the player joining the Saudi club. The deal would see Messi earn a staggering £245m-a-year. The 35-year-old’s current contract with PSG expires in June and Al-Hilal is keen to take him to the Middle East. They would be willing to pay him $300m-a-year (£245m) to get a deal over the line, according to Mundo Deportivo. If it becomes a reality, the move could see Messi renew his on-pitch rivalry with Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo joined Al-Hilal’s rivals Al-Nassr last month and will receive £175m-a-year. Should Messi accept Al-Hilal’s proposal, he would earn significantly more than Ronaldo and would get the chance to play against his great rival once more.
