Deeply concerned about the upcoming 2023 election, Nollywood actor, Willams Uchemba has called out officials of the Independent Electoral Commission, INEC, over their attitudes towards Nigerians seeking to collect their voters’ cards. He lamented that the electorates are being subjected to difficulties in their quest to collect their cards at INEC centres across the country. There have been videos of eligible voters crying out over how they are being treated by some staff of INEC who go as far as collecting money before releasing the cards. The Abia State-born actor via his Instagram account shared one of the videos of some Nigerians protesting not being able to pick up their Permanent Voters’ Cards, PVCs, from their respective zones. Uchemba lamented that most registered voters are told by INEC officials that the PVCs are either “not ready or cannot be found” stating that, INEC cannot disenfranchise people and expect a free and fair election. According to him, he “hopes INEC is ready for what is coming.” He urged the electoral umpire to do the needful in order to resolve the matter.
