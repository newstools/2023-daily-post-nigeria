The Jigawa State fire service has warned residents to be careful of the way they handle fire and other electronics, especially during the harmattan season. The state commandant of the fire service, Ibrahim Gumel gave the warning in an interview with newsmen in his office while reacting to the fire incident at the Dutse NNPC filling station. He advised on the need for families to extinguish all fires and switch off light points and electrical appliances before going to bed. He lamented that many lives and properties have been lost to uncontrolled fires across the state. Recall that DAILY POST reported that a couple recently died from smoke inhalation after they lit a fire in their room for warmth due to the harmattan. Gumel also warned fuel attendants at filling stations to make sure motorists put off their vehicles before dispensing any fuel. He called on the people of the state to observe preventive measures to avert fire incidents in the state.
