Erik ten Hag has lamented Christian Eriksen’s injury, saying it would be difficult to replace the midfielder. The Manchester United boss, who addressed the press on Tuesday, said the club are disappointed by Eriksen’s situation. Eriksen was injured during Manchester United’s 3-1 victory over Reading in the FA Cup fourth round on Friday. The Denmark International will remain sidelined for at least four months thereby leaving Erik ten Hag with Fred, Casemiro and Scott McTominay as his only midfield options. There are reports that United will bring in a midfielder before the transfer market closes by 11 pm today. “I think you can never fill that gap because every player has his own characteristics, identity, another player will always fill in a different way, but it doesn’t mean you have to be less successful,” the Dutchman said. “It’s quite clear Christian Eriksen brings top quality to our squad and he has some specifics that are hard to replace, such as his impacts in the final third with his final ball.”
