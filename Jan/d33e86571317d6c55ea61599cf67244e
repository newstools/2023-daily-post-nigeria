Names of about three clubs France legend, Zinedine Zidane, would prefer to join in the near future have been revealed. According to The Athletic, Zidane is reportedly eyeing a return to Real Madrid. However, the former midfielder is also open to managing Juventus or Marseille when he gets back into management. The report added that Zidane is open to a return to Los Blancos for a third stint once the La Liga champions are done with Carlo Ancelotti.
