Nigeria’s non-oil exports increased to $4.820 billion, representing 39.91 per cent growth in 2022, the Nigerian Export Promotion Council, NEPC, disclosed on Friday. In perspective, NEPC explained that Semi-processed(manufactured products) made up 36.61 per cent of the exports outperforming Agriculture’s 30.12 per cent volume of non-oil exports; in comparison, Precious stones made up 17.06 per cent and others 13.21 per cent. The Executive Director/CEO of the Nigerian Export Promotion Council, Ezra Yukusak, made this known during the presentation of the 2022 non-oil export performance for the year in Abuja. Yukusak stated that about 221 products were traded as exports in the period under review. He said, “Of these products exported, Urea/Fertiliser topped the list with 32.87 per cent. “The emergence of Fertiliser (Urea) as the highest exported product in 2022 can be attributed to the Russia-Ukraine war, which created an avenue for Nigeria’s Fertilizer(Urea) to thrive. “It is worth noting that our products were shipped(exported) to 122 nations, with Brazil recording the highest import value of 12.27 per cent.”
