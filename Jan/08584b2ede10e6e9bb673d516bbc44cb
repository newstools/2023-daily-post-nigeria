With less than a few weeks to the 2023 presidential election, former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, has revealed that Peter Obi’s Labour Party (LP) is his party’s only challenge in the South-East. Saraki also insisted that the PDP will win four political zones – North-West, North-East, South-South and North-Central during the election. He disclosed this while appearing on Arise TV Morning Show on Monday. Recall that Saraki, Nyesom Wike, Udom Emmanuel, Ayo Fayose, Bala Mohammed, among others, lost the PDP 2023 presidential ticket to Atiku Abubakar. “South-South is a strong PDP area. We will do very well in South-South, South-East, the challenge we have there, of course, is Labour,” Saraki said. “But we will still do well in the South-East and take our 25 per cent. We will do well in North Central, we will do well in North-West and North-East. “We need four zones. By the time you have four zones, you will win the election. “The four zones that we will win are North-west, North-east, South-south and North-central, and we will take our 25 per cent more than 24 states. There is no doubt about that,” he added.
