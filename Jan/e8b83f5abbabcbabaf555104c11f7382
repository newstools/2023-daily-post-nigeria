Direct Israel-Nigeria flights will commence from March, the Israeli government disclosed on Wednesday. Sharon Bar-Li, Head of Africa Division, Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, gave the hint in Jerusalem. The official said the flights would further cement the relations between Africa and the Middle-East. “We are going to see a boost because right now, there is no gateway for Israel into Africa”, NAN quoted. Bar-Li recalled her stint as Ambassador to Ghana, noting that non-direct flight makes commuting difficult. The diplomat foresees “a huge change” once the Israel-Nigeria route becomes operational. The DG added that business will flourish as people “will be able to come and go easily” Bar-Li said being a religious country, both Nigerian Christians and Muslims visit Israel on pilgrimage. “Jerusalem is a sacred place for free religions, not just to Christianity, Judaism, but also to Islam where people come to mount to do little hajj.” Bar-Li said she looks forward to welcoming Aviation Minister (Hadi Sirika) for the inaugural flight of the Israel-Nigeria route.
