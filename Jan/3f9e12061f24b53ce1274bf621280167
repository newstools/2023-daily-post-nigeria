Whatever way Nigeria wants to go, Kano has a role to play, ” he said. Adebayo further said: “If the traditional politics of Kano determines where Nigeria is going, then I’m glad to say the country is going a progressive way.” Prince Adebayo pointed out that Kano people know what they want and they always decide Nigeria’s politics. He maintained that it was in Kano, MKO Abiola defeated a Kano indigene in a presidential race under the platform of SDP. “Even in recent primaries conducted by different political parties in Nigeria, Kano delegates showed (the way) the elections want to go,” he said. In a meeting with stakeholders in the state, the SDP presidential candidate said: “We need to bring new two terminals for passengers and have a new runway at Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport, (MAKIA), the present one is long overdue, considering the fact that Kano is a mega city and hub for commercial activities.”
