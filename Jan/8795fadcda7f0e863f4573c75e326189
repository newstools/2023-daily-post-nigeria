Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp, has explained why his team lost 3-0 against Brighton in Saturday’s Premier League tie at the Falmer Stadium. Klopp said Liverpool lost against Brighton because his team lost the ball much too easily, adding that they never got something going against the host. According to him, Brighton were the better team during the duration of the encounter. Two goals from Solly March and a strike from Danny Welbeck ensured Brighton defeated Liverpool at home. Speaking at his post-match press conference after the game, Klopp said, “At the moment, it’s not great. Yes, we have injury problems, but the team we lined up was absolutely not bad.” He added, “We had moments where it worked well, and we put them under pressure, but we lost the ball much too easily, so we never got something going. “Brighton was better throughout the whole 96, 97 minutes. It was clear that one team was ready to play a really good game, and one team had to fight with themselves. “The problems are the same – we don’t win the key moments, we don’t win the challenges and we lose the ball too easily.”
