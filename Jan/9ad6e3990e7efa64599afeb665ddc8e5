Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola has pinpointed the two things Arsenal is so good at amid this season’s Premier League title race. Guardiola insisted that the ‘quality and the level’ Arsenal are playing is so good. The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach spoke to the BBC after Manchester City defeated Chelsea 1-0 in a Premier League tie at Stamford Bridge, thanks to Riyad Mahrez’s goal. Man City are now five points behind Arsenal on the log. “Well, it could be seven points, or ten or eight, but now the gap is five points. “It’s not just about the points, the way they [Arsenal] are playing. Even when they lost against [Manchester] United and drew with Newcastle, the quality and the level they are playing at is so good,” Guardiola said. Man City will now face Manchester United in an away Premier League derby on January 14 at Old Trafford, while Arsenal will take on London rivals Tottenham Hotspur the following day.
