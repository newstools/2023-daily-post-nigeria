Chelsea legend, Tony Cascarino, has urged Arsenal to sign West Ham United captain Declan Rice amid the ongoing 2023 transfer window. Cascarino believes Rice will replace Xhaka in the Arsenal squad, adding that the England international will cover the weaknesses of other Gunners players. Rice, 24, has been linked with a move away from West Ham at the end of the season, with Arsenal and Chelsea keen to sign him. “Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal are a great project to join and not only because they’re top of the league,” Cascarino told The Times. “Arteta has developed young players exceptionally well. There is Gabriel Martinelli, Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard in the attacking midfield area alone. “Rice will cover for the weaknesses of others and provide a platform for teammates to play their best game. “I imagine Rice would come in to replace Granit Xhaka, which would give Arsenal depth and increase that solidity and protection in midfield. “Alongside Partey, that could be the next Patrick Vieira-Gilberto Silva partnership.”
