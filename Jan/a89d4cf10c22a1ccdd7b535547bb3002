The Federal Government has sealed pact with International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) and West African Police Information Programme (WAPIS) to end Nigeria’s insecurity. Minister of Police Affairs, Muhammad Dingyadi spoke on Tuesday during a meeting with the global security organisation. INTERPOL Executive Director of Police Services, Kavanagh Stephen visited the Ministry Headquarters in Abuja. Dingyadi announced that WAPIS and INTERPOL are willing to support Nigeria to make the country safe. The minister said crimes are complex and vary from different locations, urging stakeholders to join forces to end the challenge. Dingyadi confirmed there used to be lack of synergy among security agencies as they refused to share information at their disposals. “We have a lot of criminal issues. We require cooperation from anywhere that will assist us to curb these criminalities”, he told Stephen. Speaking, the director said exchange of information among security, border and intelligence agencies would lead to credible and up-to-date data. “We are not here to have a nice time. We are here to make sure we understand how WAPIS can support West Africa to share data among security agencies effectively”, Stephen added.
