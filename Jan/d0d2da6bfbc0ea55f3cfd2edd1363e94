FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, has revealed the world football governing body will ask every country to name a stadium after Pele. Pele passed away last week at the age of 82 after a battle with colon cancer.
Infantino said countries will be asked to honour one of the all-time greats with the gesture. Speaking as Pele’s funeral began in Santos on Monday, he said: “We are going to ask that all countries in the world have at least one stadium with the name of Pele.” Infantino explained that the reason behind this idea would be “so that children know Pele’s importance. ” The whole of Brazil began paying its respects to Pele today, as his coffin arrived at the stadium where he made his mark.
