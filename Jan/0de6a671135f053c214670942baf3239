Hoodlums together with some underage Almajiris’ in Katsina State metropolis on Thursday took to the street throwing stones immediately after President Muhammadu Buhari commissioned the newly constructed underpass bridge along Kofar Kaura Road. The hoodlums while chanting ‘we are not interested’ in Hausa were also seen throwing stones at the site of the project, an eyewitness told DAILY POST. The uproar which lasted for over 30 minutes was eventually brought under control by security personnel in conjunction with vigilantes members.  However, in the process of bringing the situation under control using teargas, some journalists running round to cover the president’s activities reportedly inhaled the smoke from the teargas. Reacting to the development, SP Gambo Isah, spokesperson, Katsina Police Command said there was no protest at all neither was Mr President booed as reported by some media houses. However, he said police operatives arrested some hoodlums creating unrest around Sabuwar Unguwa, a notorious area, for Indian hemp and drug dealers in the state. President Buhari is on a two-day visit to his home state to commission some projects executed by the state government.
