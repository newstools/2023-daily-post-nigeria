Brighton have banished Moises Caicedo from training until the end of the transfer window. This follows offers from both Arsenal and Chelsea to sign the South American. The Gunners had offered £60 million for the player which was rejected out of hand on Friday. Chelsea have not made a second offer after previously submitting £55 million which was also rebuffed. Caicedo wants to force a move away from Brighton and released a statement on Friday in which he told the club he wanted to leave. But it appears Brighton have no intention of letting him go and, according to The Athletic, Caicedo has been told to stay away from the training ground by Brighton bosses. The South American will not participate in Brighton’s FA Cup fourth round tie against Liverpool on Sunday.
