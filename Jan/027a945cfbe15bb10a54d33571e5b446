Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State has charged the leadership and entire membership of the Imo Elders Council to speak to political detractors and the opposition and interrogate their consciences over what they are doing and how it will help Imo State to either grow or develop. He appealed to members of the council to wade into the matters affecting the progress and development of the State, particularly, insecurity. Uzodinma stated this on Friday when he met with the leadership of the Imo Elders Council at the new Executive Council Chambers, Owerri. Welcoming the elders led by their chairman, HRH Eze Cletus Ilomuanya, the governor told them that the executive bill on the establishment of the body had long being signed into law, informing them that his administration is appreciative of their activities. Governor Uzodimma further said that his government is open to dialogue and discussions with whoever claims to be aggrieved “as long as the person or group comes up with what will move the state forward to the benefit of Imo people.” The governor, therefore, reminded them that it is their responsibility to intervene, “because time is running out and this administration is exhausting her patience.” He assured of the readiness of his government to restore order, repair dilapidated infrastructure and ensure peace and security of lives and property. Governor Uzodimma noted: “In spite of the lean finances, government has been able to meet her daily demands and even contended with the excruciating challenges of the moment.” Earlier in his address, Eze Ilomuanya said they came to convey their immense gratitude and thanks to the governor for standing by the council since its inauguration on December 21, 2021, and for fulfilling every promise made to them since their inauguration.
