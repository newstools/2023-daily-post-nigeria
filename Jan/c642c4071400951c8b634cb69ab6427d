A week after an Itakpe-Warri train derailed in Kogi, another train on Friday derailed in the Federal Capital Territory, leaving many passengers stranded. DAILY POST reports that the Abuja-Kaduna Train Service derailed at Kubwa on Friday afternoon. The Nigerian Railway Corporation, NRC, is yet to speak on the cause of the incident, but many passengers were seen wandering around the derailed train. Managing Director of NRC, Engr. Fidet Okhiria confirmed the incident, while stating that he was waiting to receive complete information on the incident. Last Sunday, the Itakpe-Warri train derailed in a Kogi forest though the 143 passengers were safely evacuated. The situation led to the suspension of the train service in the Itakpe-Warri axis until repairs were concluded. NRC attributed the cause to possible vandalism while it called for a full-blown investigation.
