Gabriel Martinelli has reacted to Arsenal’s decision to sign Leandro Trossard from Brighton. Trossard, a versatile attacker, can fit perfectly in the role being played by Martinelli at the club But the Brazil international appears not bothered and believes the Belgian would help the club in their pursuit of the Premier League title this season. Martinelli believes Trossard would become a ‘very important player’ for Mikel Arteta’s side. Arsenal signed the Belgium international for a £27 million deal last week, with his contract due to expire in the summer. He made his debut in the closing stages of Arsenal’s 3-2 win over Manchester United on Sunday, replacing Martinelli in the 82nd minute. Trossard’s arrival signals more competition for places in Arteta’s attack which could directly affect Martinelli. Asked about the Gunners’ decision to sign Trossard, the Brazil international told ESPN Brasil: “He’ll be a very important player for us. We know his quality. “He will certainly help a lot. On Arsenal winning the league, Martinelli said, “We have a winning mentality. “We always go on the pitch to win and we have to keep doing that if we want to be champions. “It does not depend on age, but on the mentality and the desire to win every game.”
