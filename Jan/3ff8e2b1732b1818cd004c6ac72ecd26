Southern Kaduna Christian Leaders Association and Southern Kaduna Council of Imams and Ulamaa have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to ensure peaceful coexistence in the area before, during and after the forthcoming elections. The MoU signed by Emmanuel Nuhu Kure and Chief Imam Muhammad D. Kassim, on behalf of the two religions said both groups are committed to promoting peaceful co-existence. “Having identified stakeholders (Christians and Muslims) committed to the promotion of peaceful co-existence among communities in Southern Kaduna, Kaduna State, Nigeria, the above leaders do undertake to sign this MOU as a mark of their commitment towards sustaining peaceful coexistence for progress before, during and after the February/March 2023 General Elections.” The two groups agreed that in the event a crisis erupts in other places, they would jointly ensure that it does not consume Southern Kaduna and that their members are not involved. It added that in a situation where anyone attempts to aid outsiders to create or start a crisis, they would jointly release their members to protect the land from both external and internal trouble before, during and after the 2023 General Elections. “This MOU is meant to serve as a reminder of the commitment of the undersigned in support of a crisis-free 2023 general elections in Southern Kaduna. It also establishes a basis for ongoing dialogue and cooperation between the participants, so that future interventions and areas of mutual interest may be brought under this framework,” the statement explained. The groups urged community members to be vigilant and ensured a peaceful atmosphere during the forthcoming general elections.
