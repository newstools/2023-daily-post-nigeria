The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, has said the excuse of security threats pushed by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has no bearing on the ongoing currency swap across the country. Ganduje had, in an interactive session with critical stakeholders, including scholars, legislators, political leaders and the business community in the state, revealed that his administration had requested President Muhammadu Buhari to postpone his official visit to Kano. He said Kano was deeply concerned about the hardship principally induced by the ongoing cash swap from old to redesigned Naira notes. According to him, the decision was taken to avoid any unforeseen circumstances. However, the CBN governor debunked Ganduje’s assertion, saying, as quoted by NAN: “I don’t understand the relationship between the CBN policy and security challenges in Kano State.” Meanwhile, Buhari had earlier on Sunday morning approved an extension of the ongoing currency swap by ten days, moving the deadline from January 31 to February 10.
