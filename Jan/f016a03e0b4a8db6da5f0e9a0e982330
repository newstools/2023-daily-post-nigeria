Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has jumped to the defence of defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka amid criticism from the club’s legend, Roy Keane. Wan-Bissaka came under fire for failing to deal with a threat that allowed Arsenal to score their opening goal during Man United’s Premier League 3-2 loss to Mikel Arteta’s side at the weekend. Eddie Nketiah brushed past Wan-Bissaka to open the scoring for the Gunners Arsenal against Erik ten Hag’s side with a brilliant header at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. Reacting to the setback, Keane criticised Wan-Bissaka for his lack of ‘awareness’ leading to the goal, insisting that the former Crystal Palace star ‘dozes off.’ Speaking on the development, Ferdinand, on his Vibe with Five Podcast, defended Wan-Bissaka. Ferdinand said, “This [Arsenal’s first goal] is all about awareness and seeing that bigger picture and that comes from reps in training. “For Aaron Wan-Bissaka, and all full-backs, it is a really hard skill to master, by the way. The way the guys were talking about it yesterday was like it was easy. It is not easy. That is one way that 33-year-olds get unpicked at the end of their career when they are meant to know it back to front.”
