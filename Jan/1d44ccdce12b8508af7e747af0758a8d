The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan on Monday took a swipe again at the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, alleging that the party while in power abandoned North East to Boko Haram. Lawan said it was not until President Muhammadu Buhari came into power that the region was eventually liberated from the clutches of the Boko Haram insurgents. Lawan subsequently thanked President Buhari for the many benefits the North East enjoyed from his administration. Speaking at the APC presidential campaign rally which was attended by President Buhari in Bauchi, the Senate President said: “Mr President, the PDP abandoned the North East to Boko Haram, to insurgency. “PDP abandoned us until you came into office. In 2015, when you were sworn in, your first task was to liberate us. Thank you very much that you did. He said further: “We in the North East are probably the most beneficiaries of your administration. In fact, we were the first to start enjoying your administration more than any other part of Nigeria, because Boko Haram was technically defeated immediately after you came into office and you appointed our son, Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Yusuf Buratai and, of course, Air Marshal Sadique Baba Abubakar as Chief of Air Staff. “They did so well that your government gave the security that we are enjoying today. The North East, from 2015 particularly, enjoyed the most important appointments in your administration. That is to say that you are a northeasterner. This crowd is a testimony. Everywhere you go is Buhari, in the northeast.” Lawan made similar declarations two weeks ago at a campaign rally in Yobe when he blamed PDP for allowing the Boko Haram insurgency to fester while the party was in power.
