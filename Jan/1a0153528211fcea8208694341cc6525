Chelsea hierarchy warned Mykhailo Mudryk that he could face a huge time getting minutes if he signed for Arsenal, The Athletic reports. Arsenal were hot favourite to land Mudryk this January. But after several weeks of negotiations, the Gunners were unable to agree a fee with Shakhtar Donetsk. That allowed Chelsea to hijack the transfer last weekend and complete a deal. Blues co-owner Behdad Eghbali and director of global transfers Paul Winstanley flew to Turkey for face-to-face negotiations with Shakhtar on Saturday, before flying back to London with Mudryk once an £88.6 million deal had been agreed. It is understood that Arsenal was Mudryk’s preferred destination and during lengthy talks on Saturday, Chelsea made a case as to why the 22-year-old should make the move to Stamford Bridge instead. Chelsea told Mudryk that he would play a key role in Graham Potter’s side and that the club would provide a “platform” for him to thrive. The report also claims that Chelsea chiefs argued that Mudryk would face more difficulty at Arsenal where he would be fighting for a spot alongside Gabriel Martinelli.
