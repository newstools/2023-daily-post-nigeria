The long-drawn legal battle on the governorship ticket of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Jigawa State was on Friday laid to rest by the Supreme Court with the affirmation of the incumbent Deputy Governor, Umar Namadi as the lawful candidate. The apex court in a unanimous judgment prepared by Justice Kudirat Kekere-Ekun upheld the primary election conducted on May 26 which produced Namadi as the winner. In the judgment delivered by Justice Ibrahim Saulawa on behalf of the court, the appeal filed by Farouk Adamu Aliyu, a former Minority Leader of the House of Representatives was dismissed in its entirety. The five justices of the court who heard the case unanimously agreed that it lacked merit and substance. Namadi, through his counsel, Prince Lateef Olasunkanmi Fagbemi, SAN, had won the legal battle at the Federal High Court in Dutse as well as at the Court of Appeal in Kano.
