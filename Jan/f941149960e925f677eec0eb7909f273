Prof. Pat Utomi has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to probe alleged hoarding of Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) in Lagos State. The Convener of Big Tent Coalition for Peter Obi-Yusuf Datti campaign made the call on Monday in Lagos. The political economist urged the commission not to allow any plot to disenfranchise the electorate. “NEC must consider this alleged abuse as a violation of the electoral Act and tackle it headlong”, he said. The former presidential candidate complained about the destruction of Labour Party (LP) campaign materials. He condemned the tearing of the posters and beating of citizens wearing vests of other parties in Lagos. Utomi called such acts “uncivilised” and “unbecoming of people who claimed to be progressives and enlightened”. “The use of area boys to intimidate voters is said to reach proportions of taking some people to the International Criminal Court (ICC).” The professor added that a new modern Lagos “ought to be an arena of democratic freedom”.
