Chelsea boss, Graham Potter, has singled out three Crystal Palace stars, Wilfried Zaha, Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise, ahead of both teams’ Premier League tie on Sunday. Potter believes Eze, Olise and Zaha pose a threat to Chelsea when they host Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge. According to him, Patrick Vieira’s side have ‘dangerous players’ who can move with the ball well and attack the opponent. “We have to recover from the disappointment of Thursday’s game, and then we’ve to assess all the players in terms of recovery and injuries,” Potter said at his pre-match press conference on Friday. “Then we’ve to try to be positive and move forward and take a home game on. It is another London derby against a team with dangerous players, so we’ve to be good ourselves and prepare the team. “I think Patrick’s done a fantastic job since he has been there. They have always got dangerous players. Young players, so they are not maybe as consistent as they would like, but the quality they have with Eze, Olise, Zaha, there are players there who can travel with the ball well, who can attack, who can eliminate you in one-on-one situations.”
