Legendary Arsenal boss, Arsene Wenger, has said the team “can go all the way” in the title race and singled out “amazing” team captain, Martin Odegaard. The Gunners are seven points clear of Premier League champions Manchester City after beating Brighton 4-2 on New Year’s Eve. Wenger, who won three league titles during his time in charge, thinks that the current team has the right mentality to lift the trophy again. Odegaard scored his seventh goal of the campaign in the game, and Wenger has been hugely impressed by his development. The Frenchman told TV2 : “He makes decisions quickly and always optimally. It is remarkable! I like him and the way he makes football look so easy. “He has developed very well. It’s really amazing. “His decisions, he is also a leader in the team. You see that Norway is now getting more top-class players, and I hope they can do well internationally in the years to come.”
