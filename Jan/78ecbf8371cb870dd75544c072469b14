The Nigeria Customs Service, NCS, Tincan Island Port Command, generated revenue of N574.3 billion in 2022. Comptroller Olakunle Oloyede, the Customs Area Controller, CAC, Tincan Island Port Command, disclosed this at a news conference on Friday in Lagos. Oloyede said the figure represented an appreciation of N80.90 billion or 16.39 per cent compared with N493.4 billion recorded in 2021. “This feat can be credited to the constant rejigging of the existing measures geared toward sustaining the command’s revenue profile. “These led to timely utilisation, intelligence and voluntary compliance to the government’s extant laws by the trading public,” he said. Oloyede further said: “A total of 60 suspects were arrested in 2022 and were granted administrative bail while the command has eight cases pending in court. “However, the export report shows a decrease in tonnage of export from 1,723,986.8 in 2021 to 336,179.5 in 2022.” He listed the commodities exported through the command as cocoa beans, insecticides, dried ginger, empty bottles, soya beans, cashew nuts, cigarettes, rubbers, cocoa butter, frozen shrimps, copper ingots, aluminium ingots, sesame seeds and other manufactured items. “Cocoa beans were the highest exported commodity while the legendary stout was the least exported commodity,” he added.
