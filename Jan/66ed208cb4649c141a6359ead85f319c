The presidential flag bearer of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, has congratulated the people of Kwara State for their political liberation secured in the 2019 general elections which swept the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, out of power. Speaking at the presidential campaign rally of the party held at the Metropolitan Square, Ilorin on Tuesday, Tinubu said the people of the state deserve a big congratulations for that feat. The presidential candidate who asked whether they wished to go back to the dark era again, urged them to cement their freedom by securing their Permanent Voter Cards, PVCs, and vote massively APC to sustain their political freedom. Tinubu thanked the people for believing in Governor Abdulrahaman Abdulrazaq and charged them to use their brooms to sweep the party to victory in the impending general elections at all levels.
