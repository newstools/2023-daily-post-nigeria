A football fan who got Lionel Messi’s name tattooed on his face is now regretting his decision. The fan had his face tattooed following Argentina’s triumph at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar in December. Messi netted seven times at the World Cup and also gave three assists to help his side to the trophy. The 35-year-old won the Golden Ball and his winning run and performances have seen many fans, players, and legends claim that Messi is the greatest footballer of all time. Mike Jambs, a Colombian fan of the Argentine football king, went out of the way to get Messi’s name tattooed on his forehead. However, the fans is now claiming that his action has brought ‘negative things’ to his life Jambs wrote on Instagram, “I regret having done the tattoo because instead of bringing me positive things, it’s led to lots of negative things, both personally and for my family. “I didn’t think I’d be saying this so soon and I felt very proud of what I’d done in the first few days, but I now wish I hadn’t done it.”
