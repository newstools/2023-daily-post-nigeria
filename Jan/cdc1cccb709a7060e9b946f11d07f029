The remains of a woman has been declared missing at the mortuary of the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, OOUTH, Sagamu, Ogun State. Relatives of the deceased, who were ready for a burial ceremony, had visited the mortuary from Ijebu-Ode on Friday to pick up her body, with an ambulance and a team of undertakers. But they were shocked when they discovered that their dead relative was no more in the morgue. The Chief Medical Director of OOUTH, Dr. Oluwabunmi Fatungase, confirmed the development in a statement on Sunday, expressing concern over what it described as a mix-up. While saying that the management is working towards unraveling the situation, Fatungase said the issue of missing corpses is unprecedented in the hospital mortuary. According to her, the management is working with necessary agents and individuals to unravel the circumstances behind the mix-up. She disclosed that footage from the Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras at the mortuary camera was being evaluated, even as she pleaded for the cooperation of the affected family. She threatened that, “the public service rules will be applied on whoever is found culpable. “The present administration in Ogun State has upgraded the mortuary with modern freezers and scaled up its amenities.” The CMD apologised to the affected family over the embarrassing situation, assuring them that the corpse would be identified and released to them for a befitting burial soon.
