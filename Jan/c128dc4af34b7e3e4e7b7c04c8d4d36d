Super Eagles striker Terem Moffi has rejected a move to West Ham United. The player is set to remain at his French side Lorient despite West Ham having an offer accepted. The Premier League side had an offer accepted for the 23-year-old Nigeria international, however, the player only wanted to move to fellow Ligue 1 side OGC Nice. French journalist Mohamed Toubache reports that Nice’s most recent bid for the player was €10 million less than what West Ham offered. But Lorient are looking for more, therefore, the striker is likely to remain at the club. Meanwhile, Arsenal and their defender Kieran Tierney are set to go their separate ways but it would happen in the summer. The player wants to leave the Emirates amid the Gunners’ interest in highly-rated youngster Ivan Fresneda. Arsenal have been linked with Real Valladolid’s 18-year-old sensation, and the north London outfit are said to be leading the race.
