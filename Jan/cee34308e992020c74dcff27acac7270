Troops of Operation Hadin Kai alongside members of the civilian joint task force have reportedly annihilated a top Boko Haram commander, Abu Illiya alongside his 32 fighters. The feat was said to have been achieved during an intelligence-led aggressive fighting patrol in some identified Boko Haram enclaves in Kayamari, Habasha and Yuwe villages in Konduga Local Government Area of Borno State. According to Zagazola Makama, a counter-insurgency expert and security analyst in Lake Chad, multiple intelligence sources indicated that the troops’ superior firepower forced the surviving terrorists to flee in disarray thereby abandoning their property and weapons. The troops also recovered and destroyed 50 bicycles from the terrorists’ hideouts. The newly appointed Theatre Commander, Joint Task Force, North East Operation Hadin Kai, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Ali shortly after taking over the command pledged to sustain efforts towards ending the fight against the Boko Haram insurgency in the North East. To achieve this, according to the new commander, all hands must be on deck.
