Arsenal have triggered clauses to extend the contracts of Bukayo Saka and William Saliba by an extra year, ESPN reports. However, the Premier League side are in talks over long-term agreements with the players. Both Saka and Saliba are entering the final six months of their current deals. But the Gunners have activated extensions to keep the pair at the club until 2024. The league leaders are confident of securing their future beyond next year. It is believed Saka is in line for a big payrise to around £200,000-a-week. Saliba was signed from Saint Etienne for £27million in 2019 but returned to the Ligue 1 club on a season-long loan before temporary stints at Nice and Marseille. The 21-year-old’s dramatic rise has created expectations of a significant salary increase.
