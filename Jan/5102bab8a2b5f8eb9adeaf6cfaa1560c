The English Football Association has handed a warning letter to Arsenal star Oleksandr Zinchenko. The Ukrainian received a warning letter for his exuberant celebrations after Arsenal’s victory over Fulham in the Premier League earlier in the season. Arsenal had beaten Fulham 2-1 to maintain their perfect start to the season back in August. Gabriel endured a moment to forget as he lost the ball on the edge of his own box, allowing Aleksandar Mitrovic to put Fulham ahead shortly after half-time. Gabriel’s late winner during the game sparked wild celebrations at the Emirates Stadium. Zinchenko was not named in Mikel Arteta’s XI for the game due to injury but ran from the bench to celebrate with his team-mates. The Ukraine international jumped onto the backs of his team-mates and pumped his fists towards the crowd, before talking briefly with Gabriel. And the FA sent out a letter to the player containing warning about his celebrations and telling him to refrain from entering the field of play when he was not involved, effectively making him a ‘pitch invader’. The Daily Telegraph reports that Zinchenko quickly assured the FA that it would not happen again.
