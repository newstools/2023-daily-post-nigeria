The Zamfara State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has alleged that the State Anti-Thuggery Committee was established to intimidate its members and supporters during the 2023 general elections. The Acting State Chairman of the Party, Hon. Muktar Lugga disclosed this on Saturday during an interview with newsmen in Gusau, the State capital. According to Lugga, the committee had no constitutional role to play in the election as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had outlined conventional security agencies to take part in providing adequate security during election processes across the country. “Therefore, any attempt to give chance to the State anti-thuggery committee is contradictory to the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and will not be accepted by the PDP in the State. “The PDP will continue to follow the rule of law in the fight for our rights and we will never succumb to any pressure until we salvage Zamfara State. “I have said it times without number that no amount of intimidation or harassment can pull us back, we must address the perplexing and embarrassing situation of the State. “We are, therefore, alerting all security agencies in the State to note and remain focused in their responsibilities to ensure peaceful political processes across the State,” he said. The chairman also expressed worry over the recent indiscriminate arrest of the party’s supporters, including PDP heavyweights, citing example of the recent arrest and detention of a former minister of Information, Hon. Ikira Bilbis and a former Ambassador, Captain Mairiga Mafara.
