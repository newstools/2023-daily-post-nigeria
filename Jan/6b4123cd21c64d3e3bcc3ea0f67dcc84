The Central Bank of Nigeriaâ€™s cash withdrawal limit policy for individuals and corporate entities will take effect today. Recall that the apex bank made a U-turn on its cash withdrawal policy. Under the reviewed Policy, individuals can only withdraw a maximum of N500, 000, while corporate organisations can withdraw N5 million cash weekly. Also, third-party cheques above N100, 000 are no longer eligible for payment over the counter. They would subsequently be paid into bank accounts. However, if there is a compelling reason to withdraw cash over the stipulated limits, such a request shall be subjected to three and five per cent for individuals and companies, respectively.
