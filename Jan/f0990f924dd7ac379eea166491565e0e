The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akwa Ibom State has expelled Ita Enang, an ex-Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari, over what it termed “anti-party activities”. The expulsion came after recommendations from Enang’s ward in Ibiono Ibom LGA of the state. In a letter dated January 24, 2023, the state working committee of the APC led by the chairman of the party, Stephen Ntukekpo, ratified the ward’s recommendations expelling him. The letter indicated the anti-party activities include his indulgence with the PDP in Akwa Ibom State and his willful but unlawful disobedience of the directives of the APC. It added that “Consequently, I write on behalf of the state working committee (SWC) to ratify the decision of the disciplinary committee of the All Progressives Congress; that, Senator Ita Solomon Enang, be and is hereby expelled from the All Progressives Congress.” This comes a week after an Appeal Court upheld Akanimo Udofia as the authentic APC candidate in Akwa Ibom.
