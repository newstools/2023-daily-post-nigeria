As the electioneering period ahead of the 2023 general elections heats up, the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, Ondo Council on Friday, warned fake journalists to stay away from the state. While stressing that the union is determined to checkmate the influx of quacks into the pen profession, the NUJ Chairman, Leke Adegbite, disclosed that the move will curtail the activities of unauthorised persons into the state in the guise of being journalists. In a statement by the Secretary of the union in the state, Olaoluwa Meshack, he emphasised that during the political period, fake journalists claiming to the correspondents or reporters of some media stations based outside the state always troop in to extort unsuspecting victims. “These groups of people are not journalists or media practitioners as they are not employed in any media organisation but continue to constitute themselves into a cartel, going around strategic locations in the state extorting money from unsuspected members of the public.” According to the union, professional journalists coming into the state should register their presence with the Council before going to the field in order to avoid embarrassment. The union maintained that journalists not duly recognised will be tagged as impersonators and that security operatives in the state have been put on the alert. “We are also asking government officials, especially politicians during this campaign season to be wary of the antics of these unscrupulous elements, by asking questions about their identities and their media stations so as not to fall prey to these quacks who had infiltrated the ranks and files of the profession.” The council further maintained that the action will enhance zero-tolerance stance of the union against quack and fake journalists. “We encouraged all members of the union to support the members of the Task Force to succeed in their assignment while members of the public are advised to call the following numbers of the NUJ Taskforce: 08060532805, 08066596452, 08032649623 – to report activities of any fake journalists caught in the act.”
