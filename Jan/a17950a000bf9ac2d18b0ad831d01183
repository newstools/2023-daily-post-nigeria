Eighteen persons were on Wednesday burnt to death in an auto crash in Bauchi State. Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Bauchi Commander, Yusuf Abdullahi, confirmed the incident in a statement on Thursday. The FRSC boss said the accident, which involved one Toyota Hiace bus and an articulated vehicle, occurred at about 4:40 p.m. at Narbodo village of Toro Local Government Area of the State. Abdullahi explained that three people on board the trailer were unscathed, adding that the crash was caused by speed violation, leading to a head-on collision between the two vehicles. “Twenty one people were involved in the road crash and there were 18 male adults and three children. “Eighteen people who were all inside the Toyota Hiace bus were burnt beyond recognition as the vehicle went up in flames after having a head-on-collision with the trailer,” he said. Abdullahi also stated that mass burial was immediately carried out for the victims by the Nigeria Police Force. He, however, urged vehicle owners and drivers to ensure that they have good tyres and drive on average speed. He also advised Nigerians to always be conscious of traffic rules and regulations while plying the roads.
