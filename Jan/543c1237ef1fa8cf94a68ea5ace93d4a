Nigeria Customs Service Area 2 Command, Onne Seaport in Rivers, has generated a total sum of N242,090,629,309.29 in the 2022 fiscal year. According to the News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, the Comptroller, Mr Auwal Muhammad, disclosed this on Thursday in Onne during his official handing over to the newly deployed Comptroller, Mr Baba Imam. Muhammad said that the figure represented an increase of 28.3 per cent. Highlighting some of the command’s achievements, Muhammad attributed his administration’s success to the robust synergy among officers and relevant stakeholders. According to him, the Nigerian Customs Service, Onne port, is a revenue-generating command with a statutory function covering vast anti-smuggling activities and serving as an export point for goods. “Comparatively, when I took over in Sept. 2020, the command generated total revenue of N118 billion in 2021, an improved income to the tune of N188.6 billion representing more than N54 billion increase. “This constant increase became possible following the introduction of improved revenue generation structures which has enabled the command to achieve as much as the total sum of N242,090,629,309.29 in 2022,” he said. The Comptroller also attributed the successes recorded to aggressive operational activities where all cargoes are subject to 100 per cent examination except where interventions became necessary. “Our ability to thoroughly examine containers has also helped us prevent the passage of contraband and unwholesome goods, as well as high-profile record seizures by the command. “The command recorded 51 seizures with a duty paid value amounting to N1,764,303,008.9 in 2022,” he added. Responding, the new Comptroller, Imam promised to leverage existing cooperation to promote the agency’s mandate.
