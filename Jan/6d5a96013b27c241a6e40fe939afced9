The Flying Eagles will intensify preparations for the 2023 Africa U-20 Cup of Nations when they resume training on the grass pitch of the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja, practice section on Monday. Ladan Bosso’s side have been training on the astro turf pitch of the FIFA Gold Project facilities since they set up camp in the Federal Capital Territory last year. Matches at the 2023 U-20 AFCON will be played on natural grass pitch hence the need to change the team’s training venue. It will also allow the Golden Eaglets to have full access to the Goal Project pitch as they resume training tomorrow morning. The seven-time African champions will face Zambia in a double header friendly on January 27 and 30. The two matches will be played at the Moshood Abiola Stadium. The Flying Eagles will face hosts Egypt, Mozambique and Senegal in Group A at the competition.
