Reading boss and former Manchester United star Paul Ince has described Marcus Rashford as unplayable. Paul Ince is hoping that Erik ten Hag does not feature in the England international for this weekend’s FA Cup clash against Reading at Old Trafford. Championship side Reading travel to Old Trafford on Saturday for the FA Cup fourth round. Even though Ince would not want his team to focus on one particular United player, he admits he would rather Rashford was given the weekend off. Rashford has been outstanding for Erik ten Hag’s side this season, scoring 21 goals in 34 games. “Hopefully he’s not going to play. I was a bit disappointed they won 3-0 the other night because he might play against us now because it looks like that tie is more or less over,” Ince said at his pre-match press conference. “He is unplayable at the moment, unstoppable. “The goal he scored against Forest showed what type of form he is in.”
