Ten persons died in the early hours of Saturday when a commercial bus rammed into a truck in Ogun State. DAILY POST reports that the fatal crash occurred at about 04:30am on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, around Oniworo area. The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) said a total of 19 persons were involved in the crash, comprising 13 male adults and six female adults. “Two male adults sustained injuries, 10 persons died, being seven male adults, two female adults and one female child; while the remaining persons were unhurt,” the FRSC spokesperson in Ogun State, Florence Okpe, said on Saturday. The accident, according to Okpe, involved a Toyota Hiace bus with registration number, KLD539XA, and a Mack container truck with no registration number attached to it. Okpe blamed the crash on road obstruction on the part of the truck. According to her, the bus driver, while on excessive speeding, lost control and ran into the truck from the rear. The injured victims were taken to Victory Hospital Ogere for medical attention, while the corpses were deposited at the Ipara morgue. The Ogun FRSC Sector Commander, Ahmed Umar expressed displeasure that motorists refused to obey simple rules. He told road users to be cautious of poor visibility due to harmattan haze, charging motorists to put on the head lamp when the weather is poor. He cautioned motorists, especially truck drivers, against non-display of caution signs whenever there is any breakdown on the road. Umar commiserated with the family of the crash victims, asking them to contact FRSC Ogunmakin for more information about the crash.
