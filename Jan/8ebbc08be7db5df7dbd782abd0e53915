Manchester United legend, Roy Keane has urged Marcus Rashford to emulate one of Cristiano Ronaldo’s qualities at Old Trafford by becoming the club’s ‘main man.’ Keane believes Rashford has the quality to lead Man United and has backed him to succeed Ronaldo, who left the club last November after his contract was terminated by mutual consent. The Irishman said this during Sky Sports’ post-match coverage after Man United defeated Nottingham Forest 3-0 in the Carabao Cup semi-final first-leg tie at the City Ground. “This is the question mark I have had over Marcus the last few years – has he got that personality to step up to the plate? United have had some great strikers over the years – Ronaldo, Van Nistelrooy, Andy Cole, Mark Hughes, the list goes on and on,” Keane said. “I think United need someone like that, and I hope Marcus is saying, ‘listen, I want that responsibility to be the main man.'”
