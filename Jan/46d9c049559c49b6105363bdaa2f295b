Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has switched his attention to Chelsea’s Jorginho in his search for a new central midfielder. According to SportsMail, a deal is a long way off, but work towards the transfer has started. It could be completed ahead of Tuesday’s transfer deadline. This comes as Arsenal spent the whole of Monday deliberating whether to send in a third offer for Brighton midfielder, Moises Caicedo, amid fears they could damage their relationship with Brighton if they submit an improved bid. Gunners chiefs were deliberating if to improve upon their latest bid of up to £ 70 million. But Arsenal have started analysing alternatives; with Chelsea midfielder Jorginho emerging as their preferred option.
