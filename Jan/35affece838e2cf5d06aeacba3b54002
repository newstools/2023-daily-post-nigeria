The Labour Party (LP) governorship candidate in Kaduna State in this year’s election, Jonathan Asake, says his administration will operate on the principles of fairness, equity and justice as enshrined in the 1999 constitution if elected. According to him, it is only when the government is properly guided on the principles as enshrined in the constitution that equity would be observed in dealing with every section of the state. Speaking to Muslim Ummah in Zaria, the governorship candidate lamented that majority of them have been affected by the wrong policies of the APC government, stressing that it was imperative to seek their prayers, support and interact on the way forward for the development of the state. The governorship flag bearer said, “I will defend the rights of every citizen to exercise their sociocultural and religious freedom at all times, inclusiveness will be my watch word to ensure fairness, justice to every citizen and resident in the state.” In a press release made available by James Swam, the Media aide to the governorship candidate, quoted Asake as urging the clerics to deeply reflect on the prevailing economic and security situations of the state and preach the truth so that the electorate would understand what choice to make on March 11 for the peaceful coexistence and development of Kaduna state. He said he came to unveil himself to them, to seek their prayers and support to succeed in becoming the governor of Kaduna state come March 11 so that together they could secure the state and restore hope to the
people. He lamented that poverty, unemployment, banditry, kidnapping, ethnic and religious conflicts were the result of bad leadership in the state and pledged to reverse the trends within a record time in office for people in the state to fully showcase their potentials in order to earn a living. He said when leaders do not operate on the basis of inclusiveness and empathy the society was bound to experience decline in all ramifications as it is the case in the state now A cleric, Imam Shugaba Abdulhamid Muhammad, urged the governorship candidate to keep to his promise, adding that it is important “to operate an open door policy” in order to be accessible to the common man.
