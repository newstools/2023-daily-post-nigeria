The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, has given the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele and Minister of Finance, Budget and Planning, Zainab Ahmed, a three-day ultimatum to provide details on the N23.7 trillion Ways and Means debt restructuring request made by President Muhammadu Buhari last year. The Senate alleged that the President and the CBN governor had breached the Constitution. On Tuesday, however, Lawan asked the executive arm of government to provide the details of the N22.7tn Ways and Means restructuring request. The senate president ordered Ahmed and Emefiele to supply the required information within three days. He said, “We must have the required information to pass the N22.7tn loan request, and time is not on our side in the Senate now, given the coming general elections.”
