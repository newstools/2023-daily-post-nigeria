Former Manchester United captain, Gary Neville, has insisted Arsenal will not win the Premier League title. The Gunners are now eight points clear at the top of the table following a 2-0 victory in Sunday’s North London Derby. But when asked if Mikel Arteta’s men will win the league, Neville said on his podcast on Sunday: “No. But I said Leicester wouldn’t win the league. “They won’t win the league. Manchester City will win the league, and I think Manchester United will finish second, and I know that will annoy Arsenal fans! “I’d rather Arsenal win the league than Man City. I think it would be absolutely sensational for the Premier League.” Arsenal host Manchester United next, while City take on Spurs at the Etihad.
