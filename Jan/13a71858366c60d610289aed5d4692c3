Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has discharged any insinuation of friction in his relationship with President Muhammadu Buhari, insisting his support for the president is unalloyed and enduring. Tinubu stated this while addressing the APC rally in Gusau, the Zamfara State capital, on Saturday. The former Lagos State governor also promised to tackle problems bedevilling the state and enhancing agricultural productivity. Tinubu thanked the people of Zamfara State and key party leaders for the warm welcome and their continued support for the APC. He said, “I have supported President Buhari even before his first day in office. I will continue to be his supporter and friend after his last day in office. “He tackled the problems other leaders ran from. He has earned a place in history that cannot be denied. “I have said this before and will say it again now: when the true history of this moment is written, President Buhari shall be treated very kindly because of his contributions to the nation.” Tinubu also said Buhari and Governor Bello Matawalle had been doing their best to end the banditry problem, pledging to consolidate the gains recorded. He added, “My security plan will empower all branches of security forces. We’ll use modern air and ground technology to trace and capture these criminals.”
