Residents of Ajowa-Akoko in Akoko North West Local Government Area of Ondo State have pleaded with the Federal and the State governments to urgently stem the rising cases of insecurity in the community. Ajowa-Akoko, a border town in Ondo State, has recently experienced some security issues. Recently, the monarch of the community was kidnapped by gunmen who abducted him from his palace within the community. Few days after the monarch was released by his abductors, four students of Kogi State Polytechnic were also abducted while on their way to the community for the Yuletide celebration. At a town hall meeting to discuss the matter, the communityâ€™s spokesman, Mr. Jacob Adegoke, bemoaned the horrible experience that residents had endured over the previous two years in the hands of criminals who they claimed had killed, maimed, raped, and kidnapped their people. Adegoke called on all tiers of government to increase security in the community which he said is the last community in the State that borders the northern part of the country. Rt. Revd Ezekiel Dahunsi, the Chairman of the Ajowa community and a retired Anglican bishop, lauded Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu for strengthening security with the Amotekun Corps, but called for further help in Ajowa-Akoko to safeguard inhabitants from intimidation of any kind. Military personnel should also be deployed to support the security system in the area, according to the Oloso of Oso-Ajowa, Oba Jimoh Omoola. He called for the establishment of a divisional police headquarters at Ajowa.
