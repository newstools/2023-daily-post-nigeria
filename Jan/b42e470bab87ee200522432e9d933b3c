The leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has predicted the death of notorious bandit, Bello Turji and some ISWAP and Boko Haram commanders. Ayodele disclosed that security operatives would kill Turji and some ISWAP and Boko Haram commanders. In a statement by his spokesman, Oluwatosin Osho, the clergyman said there would be issues between the Nigerian Army and police officers that would lead to a face-off between them. He further advised the government to completely overhaul the security network to have desired results in the year. According to Ayodele: “I foresee Nigerian security operatives killing the notorious bandits leader Bello Turji. I foresee the killing of ISWAP and Boko Haram commanders. The police and army will go on strike. “A lot of things will be exposed about soldiers fighting at the war fronts. I foresee flooding killing people and destroying properties in Nigeria. “Security problems will spread to markets, schools and other public places. There should be cleansing in the Army, Air Force, Police and DSS because bad eggs are many among them. There should be a general overhauling of the security system, and competent hands must be brought in. “Government will spend a lot on security and be careful because all efforts will not come as expected.”
