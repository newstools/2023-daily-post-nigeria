The former executive secretary of the National Health Insurance Scheme, NHIS, Prof Usman Yusuf, has said the Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, Godwin Emefiele’s purported ordeal with the Department of State Service could crash the nation’s economy and currency in a sane clime. Yusuf made this disclosure on Tuesday in an Arise TV show monitored by DAILY POST. According to him, the country’s economy is in an ‘Intensive Care Unit and on the verge of collapse. He stated that Nigeria’s current debt profile and overbearing repayment burden show that the country is essentially broke. “Nigeria is in ICU; the country is essentially broke. Our children and grandchildren are indebted to the tune of N77 trillion. “Here we are with the comedy and confusion with the Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, Godwin Emefiele. In a sane clime, what is happening with the CBN Governor and CBN would crash the economy and the Naira”, he stated.
