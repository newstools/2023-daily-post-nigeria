Reacting after joining Gremio, Suarez, in a tweet via his Twitter handle, said he is preparing for the new challenge ahead. The former Atletico Madrid star tweeted: “Preparing for this beautiful challenge at Gremio, I’m excited to be there and enjoy it.” Suarez is expected to play his first game for Gremio against Sao Luiz on 17 January.
