Niger State Governor, Alhaji Sani Bello Abubakar has directed security agencies to go after the killers of a Catholic priest of SS Peter and Paul, Rev. Fr. Isaac Achi, at his residence in Kaffin Koro, Paikoro Local Government Area. Bello, in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, CPS, Mrs. Mary Noël-Berje, described the setting ablaze of the Parish Priest as ungodly and inhumane. He said attacking a religious facility to murder anyone is the worst dimension of terrorist attacks. The governor explained, “this is a sad moment, for a priest to be killed in such a manner means that we are not all safe, these terrorists have lost it, and drastic action is needed to end this ongoing carnage”. He urged the security agencies to continue to evolve new strategies that would end the atrocious and barbaric acts, adding that his government will not rest on its oars to ensure that the perpetrators were brought to book. While commiserating with the Christian community, especially the Catholic Church, over the ugly incident, the governor prayed for the quick recovery of the injured Rev. Father, who was also shot at by the bandits while trying to escape. He then enjoined the people to remain calm as the government would continue to do its best to secure the lives and livelihoods of the people.
