The spokesperson for the Bola Tinubu, Shettima Campaign Council, Festus Keyamo, has reacted to a comment by the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar, telling party members who wish to get contracts and appointments in his administration to ensure the party wins in their polling units. Keyamo expressed his feelings via his verified Twitter handle on Thursday. DAILY POST reported that Atiku made the comment on Wednesday during a town hall meeting with members and stakeholders of the party in Abeokuta, Ogun State capital. “The only way, as far as I am concerned; if I am president, if you come and say you want a job or you want a contract, I will ask you to let me have the result of your polling booth and that is what I am going to direct to everybody because unless we do that, we will not win the elections,” he said. However, Keyamo said Atiku could never change from his true nature. He noted that the PDP candidate forgot there’s a Public Procurement Act regulating the award of government contracts. He wrote, “A leopard cannot change its skin. He is already promising contracts to political allies, forgetting that there is a law called the Public Procurement Act. Mr. SPV!”
