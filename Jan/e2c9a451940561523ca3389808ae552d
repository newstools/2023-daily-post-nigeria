The Ataoja of Osogboland, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun, has warned against any unauthorised acquisition and encroachment of land without due process. The breaching of this, Oba Olanipekun disclosed has led to many crises, including a breach of public peace and the destruction of lives and properties. The monarch who was represented by the Olupona of Osogboland, Amodu Akanbi, gave the warning on the sidelines of a programme organised by Kelebe community landlords on Monday in Osogbo. He also noted that the recent judgement of an Osun High Court in Ile-Ife over a matter of land acquisition between the Nigerian Army and citizens of the state (Kelebe community ) was commendable. An Osun High Court sitting in Ile -Ife had on January 10, 2023, in suit number: HOS/40/2020, ruled that the Nigerian Army should vacate about 1000 hectares of lands unlawfully occupied since 1973. The Kelebe community landlords approached the court on July 7, 2011, in suit number (FHC/OS/CS/48/2011) to seek the nullification of the acquisition being unlawfully occupied. The Nigerian Army acquired the hectares of land through an official Gazette in 1973 without the support of the community. Akanbi sought the support of security agencies, traditional rulers and other stakeholders in ensuring that issues relating to the unlawful acquisition of lands are addressed. “I want to advise those people who acquire land from unauthorised bodies to know that the rightful owners of the land will take such back one day. “The judgement at the Osun High Court favoured us and we will be returned to our land in accordance with the law and develop our community. “The court also fined them N200 million as fine for damages to families affected while delivering the judgement on January 10 l, 2023 in Ile-Ife,” he said.
