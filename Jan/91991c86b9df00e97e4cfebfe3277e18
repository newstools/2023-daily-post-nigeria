The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd, in collaboration with a private security contractor and government security agencies, have destroyed a barge loaded with crude oil in Delta State. The team also demolished a filling station in Warri for storing stolen crude oil. DAILY POST learnt this in a statement from NNPC during the weekend. The barge was destroyed on Saturday but it was arrested on 22nd December 2022 along with some suspects. “The barge named MT Brighton 1, loaded with stolen crude, was apprehended in one of the creeks running into the Ramos River in Agge Community, a border area between Delta and Bayelsa States,” it noted. It was gathered that before the exercise, crude oil production dropped to about 1.1 million barrels per day due to oil thieves and the shutting of some vulnerable pipelines. However, it improved in December and reached 1.5m BPD, according to NNPC Ltd.
