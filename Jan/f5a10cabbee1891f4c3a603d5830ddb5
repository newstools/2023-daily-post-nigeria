Delta State Governor Special Assistant on Media, Ossai Success has cautioned Nigerians against voting for the Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate, Peter Obi. Success warned that Obi cannot fix Nigeria; hence Nigerians should not vote for him. He said the LP presidential candidate lacked the competence and experience to fix Nigeria. According to Success, the former Anambra State governor is good at identifying Nigeria’s problems but lacked the solution to the problems. “The level of competence and experience needed to fix this country is not found in Peter Obi as Nigeria at this time can’t afford to elect someone that knows our pains but can’t fix it. “We need to elect someone that knows the solution to our problems, that understands how to build an economy. “The capacity, energy, and strength to fix the issues facing us in this country can be seen in Atiku Abubakar, and his running mate Governor Ifeanyi Okowa,” he said.
