The Chairman of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, (NUJ), Yobe State Council, Rajab Mohammed has turned down his appointment as member of the APC presidential campaign council. A copy of letter obtained by DAILY POST dated 13th December 2022 and signed by the Director of Media of the APC campaign, Bayo Onanuga, indicated that Rajab Mohammed was listed as one of the members of the Media and Publicity Directorate of the Yobe APC presidential campaign council. However, in a statement issued to newsmen in Damaturu on Tuesday, Rajab explained that the ethics of the journalism profession does not allow him to accept such an appointment nor serve in such a committee. “As a journalist, I remain neutral and, therefore, cannot be seen as taking side with a political party as accepting to serve on the council will compromise my integrity,” he said. The NUJ Yobe state Chairman assured to offer professional advice(s) to the council when the need arises.
