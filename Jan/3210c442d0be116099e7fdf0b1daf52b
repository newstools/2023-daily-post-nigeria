Argentina coach, Lionel Scaloni, has named Barcelona star Pedri as the Spanish player he would like to have in his team. Scaloni recently guided Argentina to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar last December. La Albiceleste became world champions for the first time since 1986 after beating France on penalties in the final. Despite having an abundance of talent in his Argentina squad, including Paris Saint-Germain superstar Lionel Messi, Scaloni admitted that he would love to have Pedri, a Barcelona player, in his Argentina team. “If I could have a pass and take any Spanish player for my national team, it would be Pedri,” Scaloni said as per Sport.
