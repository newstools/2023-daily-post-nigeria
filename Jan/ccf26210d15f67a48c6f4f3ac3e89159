Some Muslim youths, scholars and organisations in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, have staged a protest over alleged rape of a Muslim lady in one of the mosques in Ibadan. The woman was in ‘Niqob’ Purdah when the incident occurred, a source told DAILY POST. The protest was staged by the concerned Muslim leaders on Monday. The protesters demanded prosecution of the suspect. DAILY POST gathered on Monday that a Muslim lady, who was in purdah, was allegedly raped inside a mosque at Iwo Road area of Ibadan on Sunday. A source said, “An unfortunate incident happened on Sunday in Ibadan, when the son of a road transport union sneaked into a mosque and raped a niqobite. “This then prompted the concerned Muslim leaders to stage the protest on Monday.” The concerned Muslims were led in the protest by an Ibadan-based Islamic cleric, Sheikh Amubieya. Another source told DAILY POST that the suspect had been arrested. He said, “The thug who raped a niqobite (Muslim lady in veil) has been identified as Idris, also known as Kesari. “He is the son of a union leader known as Al-Majiri. He was arrested by the police and the case has now been transferred to the State CID”.
