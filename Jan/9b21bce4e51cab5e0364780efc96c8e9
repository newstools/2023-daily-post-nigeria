A House of Representatives candidate in Ibadan North East/Ibadan South East Federal Constituency on the platform of Social Democratic Party (SDP), Hon. Deji Aboderin, has declared that politics of vote, collect money and prepare soup (Dibo Kosebe) also known as stomach infrastructure, cannot take Nigeria out of its current problems. Aboderin made this disclosure while speaking during a live radio programme on Sunday monitored by DAILY POST. The SDP candidate explained that the belief that electorate must be given money before they cast their votes cannot take Nigeria anywhere. He said that the electorate should look for candidates who will implement people-oriented projects for the good of all instead of nursing the idea of ‘Dibo Kosebe’. He added that the electorate should jettison the idea of stomach infrastructure during elections. He urged them to focus more on antecedents of candidates and what they have to offer instead of collecting money before they vote. Aboderin said, “Politics of Dibo Kosebe (Stomach infrastructure) cannot take us anywhere. “When people brought money during the elections and our people are saying that they cannot vote without collecting money, that is ‘Dibo Kosebe’, that cannot take us anywhere. “Any national assembly member that is not fighting for the interest of the people, especially the women, aged and the youth does not know what he or she is doing. “You talked about water, one of the major needs of the people in Ibadan North East) Ibadan South East is water. Many people in these areas are suffering because of water.”
