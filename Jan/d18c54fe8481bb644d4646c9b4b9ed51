Labour Party, LP, in Jigawa State has berated its former governorship candidate, Com. Abdullahi Tsoho Garba for claiming that he decamped to the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, along with all the party’s candidates and executives. Jigawa State Party chairman, Alhaji Isyaku Aliyu stated this while briefing newsmen at the party’s headquarters in Dutse. According to him “the claim by our former gubernatorial candidate, Comrade Abdullahi Tsoho Garba that he and our other candidates have joined APC is not true”. Isyaku said the former guber candidate defected alone without any candidate or party executive “over fake APC promises.” “Our party is intact from polling units, political wards, local government areas and State level,” he said. The chairman said the party had already selected Alhaji Suleman Abdul’aziz as a replacement in line with the party’s constitution and the electoral law.
