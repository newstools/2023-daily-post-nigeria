A spokesperson for Tinubu-Shettima Presidential Campaign Council, Festus Keyamo has reacted to the endorsement of the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi by former president Olusegun Obasanjo. Obasanjo had in his new year message on Sunday, declared support for the Labour Party candidate, saying he has an edge over his counterparts in other parties. Reacting, Keyamo in a tweet on his official Twitter handle, said the ex-president has the right to endorse any candidate of his choice. The Minister of State for Labour and Employment, however, tackled the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, saying Obasanjo has no confidence in his former vice. The tweet reads: “Quite within OBJ’s right to endorse anyone, but bad for PDP in 2 ways: 1, Atiku’s former boss does not think he deserves to be President this time around “2. The little support OBJ gave PDP in 2019 & they failed, he has taken that away to LP. No effect at all on @officialABAT”. Recall that the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu had earlier last year met with Obasanjo, seeking the support of the former president for his political ambition.
