Manchester City attacker, Erling Haaland, has said that teammate Riyad Mahrez helped convince him to join Pep Guardiola’s side when they met in Mykonos, Greece, in 2021. Haaland joined Man City from Borussia Dortmund for an initial fee of £51 million in the summer of 2022. The Norway international has been prolific for his Premier League giants, scoring an incredible 27 goals and registering three assists in 24 games across competitions. Speaking to CityTV about bumping into Mahrez during a vacation in Mykonos during the summer of 2021, Haaland said: “We didn’t speak a lot, but he said that I should come to City and it was a good atmosphere. “And this, for me, is really important in the team is the atmosphere that you enjoy every day. You just said a little bit and for me, that was enough.” Haaland is already just two goals behind last season’s Premier League Golden Boot winners, Mohamed Salah and Son Heung-Min. Salah and Heung-Min scored 23 goals last season, while Haaland has scored 21 goals in just 17 league games this season.
