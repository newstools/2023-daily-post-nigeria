President Muhammadu Buhari has technically endorsed the candidacy of Sen. Aisha Dairu Ahmed Binani, as the next Governor of Adamawa. The endorsement came from the President on Monday in Yola, Adamawa State, where he visited to inaugurate a number of projects executed by the State Government. Buhari said electing Binani will broaden opportunities for women in the country as well as send a positive signal to the world about Nigeria’s democratic and leadership maturity. The President who first made a stopover at the palace of the Lamido of Adamawa noted that he was not averse to providing moral support for Binani’s success in the forthcoming polls. He said, “I came to ensure that from the end of Nigeria to other places, I am identifying with the candidate, Binani, and other candidates. “We are here to ensure that Sen. Binani becomes the first female elected governor God willing. Her election would speak volumes to Nigeria and the world through Adamawa State”. Recall that Binani recently secured victory at the apex court which made her candidacy bonafide in the state. Her aspiration to become the governor of Adamawa under the platform of the ruling All Progressive Congress is viewed in some quarters as first of its kind in a Nigeria northern state.
