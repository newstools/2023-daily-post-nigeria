The All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council, APC-PCC, has said Arise TV cameraman was caught secretly streaming live its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, at an event in Lagos. The APC-PCC Director of Media and Publicity, Bayo Onanuga disclosed this in a post via his Twitter handle. Onanuga said the journalist was not authorized by anyone and was consequently busted and sent out. Recall that Tinubu had a meeting with business leaders in Lagos on Friday. He also alleged that the journalist was on espionage. He said, “Arise TV cameraman clandestinely streamed live Asíwájú Bola Tinubu’s event in Lagos today. He was not authorized by anyone. He was clearly on espionage, but was busted and sent out. Is journalism by stealth part of the practice by Arise News?”
