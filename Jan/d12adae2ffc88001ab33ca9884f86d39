Former Manchester United attacker, Odion Ighalo, has expressed his desire to play alongside Paris Saint-Germain’s Lionel Messi at Saudi Pro League club, Al-Hilal. Ighalo, who currently plays for Al-Hilal, said it would be a dream come true for him to play alongside the Argentina captain. According to the Nigerian star, the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner will make him better. Messi, 35, has been linked with a move away from PSG when his contract expires at the end of the 2022/23 season. The former Barcelona captain has been linked with both Al-Hilal and Al-Ittihad, respectively. “Of course, Messi is welcome here. It is the beautiful dream of every player in the world to play with Messi. He is one of the best on the planet,” Ighalo said [via Sky Sports]. “His presence will make me a better player and score many more goals for Al Hilal. He’ll help us win more trophies and develop the game in this country.”
