The latest update on Chelsea midfielder N’Golo Kante’s return from injury has been revealed. Kante has been plagued by injuries so far this season. The France international made just two appearances at the very start of the season against Everton and Tottenham Hotspur. The former Leicester City star injured his hamstring late on against Tottenham, and after initially trying to avoid surgery, he was forced to go under the knife, missing the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar as a result. The 31-year-old has missed 27 matches for Chelsea in all competitions so far this campaign but is now finally closing in on a return to the pitch barring any more setbacks. According to French newspaper L’Equipe, Kante is now aiming to return to action by the end of February and is upping his training. He has been training individually at Cobham since last week but could soon resume ball work before being reintegrated back into Chelsea’s first-team squad.
