Liverpool legend Michael Owen says he ‘feels sorry’ for the club’s new signing Cody Gakpo. Owen says even Lionel Messi would struggle to make an impact in the current Liverpool team. Liverpool played out a goalless draw with Chelsea at Anfield on Saturday meaning that they have won just eight of their 19 games this season. Owen noted that the Reds’ recent struggles have made it difficult for their new import, who moved to Anfield from PSV this January to hit the ground running. “I feel sorry for him actually because he’s coming into a team that are really inconsistent and drained of all the confidence,” Owen, who played for Liverpool, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Newcastle United said on Premier League Productions. “I would defy even Lionel Messi to come in and look good in this team because it’s really struggling.” Jurgen Klopp said he was okay with the result against Chelsea, promising his team would build on that. Both Chelsea and Liverpool are not in best form and are 9th and 10th in the Premier League table.
