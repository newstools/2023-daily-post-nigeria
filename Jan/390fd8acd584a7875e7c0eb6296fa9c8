Liverpool legend, Steven Gerrard has lavished praises on Chelsea’s new signing, Mykhaylo Mudryk. Gerrard said Mudryk reminds him of former Chelsea winger, Arjen Robben. The former Aston Villa coach said this after Mudryk’s cameo against Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday. Mudryk came on in the 55th minute of Chelsea’s 0-0 draw with Liverpool and showed some glimpse of his potential. There has been a lot of hype surrounding Mudryk since his big-money arrival from Shakhtar Donetsk to Stamford Bridge. Chelsea spent close to €100 million to acquire the Ukrainian’s signature, but Gerrard believes it was the real deal. “Mykhaylo Mudryk looks the real deal, some of his clips today were outstanding,” Gerrard told BT Sport. “He reminded me a little bit of Arjen Robben, his footwork, how quick he is, how he manipulates the ball, I would be very excited if I was Chelsea.”
