Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, on Sunday, warned frontline presidential candidates Bola Tinubu (APC), Atiku Abubakar (PDP) and Peter Obi (LP) against relying on northern governors to win the 2023 election. Okechukwu Isiguzoro, the Secretary-General of Ohanaeze, said with the introduction of BVAS by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Tinubu, Atiku, and Obi are doomed if they depend on governors in the North. According to Isiguzoro: “Those presidential candidates counting on the old arrangements of Northern Governors’ scheming moves to manipulate and rig the elections for them on February 25th Presidential elections 2023 will be disappointed with the realities on the grounds. The Arewa and Northern Youths led by Yerima Shettima are the street generals that will decide which of the presidential candidate will win the 2023 presidential elections based on the voting strengths of the North. “Ndigbo has observed that INEC was right in [its] assumptions that 2023 is for the Nigerian youths, as they will play a critical role in whoever will win the 2023 elections. “Northern governors are helpless to help Tinubu, Atiku, or Obi, to win the 2023 elections, and the Southern governors are in disarray and confusion about the choice of the presidential candidate to work for. “If Atiku, Obi, and Tinubu are counting on the governors they are doomed, the governors are encountering complications on how most of them will win the senatorial seats of their various constituencies with the introduction of INEC BVAS; only the youths and women will decide what will happen at polling units across the country in the Presidential elections.”
