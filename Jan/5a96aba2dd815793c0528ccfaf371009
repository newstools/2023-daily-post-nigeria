Former England boss, Sven-Goran Eriksson has said that Manchester United and Arsenal will compete to sign ‘fantastic’ Portugal star Goncalo Ramos, who replaced Cristiano Ronaldo easily at the World Cup. Eriksson believes the Benfica star is ‘destined’ to play for big clubs in the best league in the world, the Premier League. The 21-year-old Ramos came through Benfica’s academy and scored eight goals in 46 appearances for the Portuguese giants Ramos netted 15 times in 24 appearances for Benfica this season and stepped up to replace Cristiano Ronaldo, after the 37-year-old was dropped in their round of 6-0 winner over Switzerland. “Arsenal and Manchester United will look at Goncalo Ramos as an option,” Eriksson told OLBG. “Goncalo Ramos is a fantastic player, it’s not easy to replace Cristiano Ronaldo like he did. “He will end up in the Premier League like a lot of Portuguese players, he can adapt there. I’m sure that clubs like Arsenal or Manchester United will look out for him.”
