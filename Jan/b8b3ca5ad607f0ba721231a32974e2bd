Liverpool legend, Graeme Souness, still believes Manchester City will win the Premier League title this season. The champions are currently in second place, seven points behind Arsenal. But Souness has pointed to their “inner belief” as a key factor in the title race. He told Sky Sports: “They haven’t been terribly convincing, but they have the inner belief that they can win the league. “That will stand them in good stead.’ City have dropped points in two of their last five matches and have looked uncharacteristically leaky this season despite their fine displays in attack.
