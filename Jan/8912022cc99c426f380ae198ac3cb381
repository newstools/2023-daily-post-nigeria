Elder Wole Oyelese, a former Minister of Power and Steel, has revealed that the overbearing attitude of Governor Seyi Makinde has driven many prominent members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) away. Oyelese, who spoke on Tuesday, noted that Makinde’s action in the last three and half years of his administration has forced many members out of the party. DAILY POST also learned that Oyelese is a native of Egbeda local government area of the state. The former minister, who is one of the chieftains of the PDP in the state, made these disclosures while speaking with journalists in Ibadan, the state capital. DAILY POST recalls that Makinde had while featuring on a Channels Television programme, made some unprintable words about Oyelese and other leaders of the party. Oyelese has, however, revealed that Makinde’s overbearing attitude has driven many members of the party away. The former minister, while speaking, noted that Makinde’s attitude as demonstrated in the interview had forced many prominent members of the party to go to other political parties. He added that Makinde should recall how in 2015 he (Oyelese) led a group of leaders to introduce him to prominent traditional rulers in the state. He added that he was the one that introduced him (Makinde) to the mainstream of Oyo state politics. Oyelese said, “Many of those people are still very much alive and politically active and relevant in all the senatorial districts of Oyo state. “He should at least have recalled how I led the group to all the prominent Traditional Rulers in Oyo state and introduced him to the mainstream and thus give us some credit and respect”.
