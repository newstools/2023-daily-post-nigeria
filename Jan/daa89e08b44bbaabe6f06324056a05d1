A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has adjourned hearing on the substantive suit seeking disqualification of a House of Representatives candidate for Igbo-Etiti/Uzo-Uwani Federal Constituency, Hon. Martins Oke. Oke is the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, candidate in the forthcoming election. DAILY POST reports that the plaintiffs, Chief Samuel Ekwueme and the All Progressives Congress, APC, are challenging his candidature on the claim that he did not emerge in line with the relevant laws. Joined as defendants are the PDP and the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC. The plaintiffs alleged that the PDP primary election which produced the serving lawmaker was in contravention of section 77(3) of the Electoral Act. The Electoral Act made it mandatory for the PDP to submit its membership register to the INEC not later than 30 days to its primary election. At the resumed hearing on Thursday, the presiding Judge, Hon Justice J. B. Omotosho asked the defendants’ counsels to file all their defences on time to allow the plaintiff’s counsel, Chief Chukwudi Igwe to reply before the adjourned date. The Judge warned that he wouldn’t want any delay on the matter, adding that after the hearing on 10th February, 2023, the matter would be adjourned for judgement.
