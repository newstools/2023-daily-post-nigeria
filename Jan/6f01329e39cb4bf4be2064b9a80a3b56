Flying Eagles head coach, Ladan Bosso has revealed his team’s ambition ahead of the 2023 Africa U-20 Cup of Nations. The seven-time champions will face hosts Egypt, Mozambique and Senegal in the group stage of the competition. The Flying Eagles are among the favourites to win the competition after claiming the WAFU B title in Niger Republic last May. The U-20 AFCON will also serve as the qualifiers for the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup hosted by Indonesia later in the year. Bosso stated that winning the competition in Egypt remains his priority. “We won the WAFU qualifiers in Niger Republic and it’s my wish that we go to the World Cup in Indonesia as the champions of Africa,” Bosso told reporters in Abuja. “That aside, I want to make amends for the 2007 not-pleasant performance of the Flying Eagles. I want to improve on it by going all the way “
