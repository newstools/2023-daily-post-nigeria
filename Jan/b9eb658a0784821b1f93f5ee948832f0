The Anambra State chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC), says it is ready to receive the presidential candidate of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu in the state. The party said it has made adequate security arrangement to ensure a hitch free rally on Tuesday in Awka, Anambra State capital. The chairman of the party in the state, Mr Basil Ejidike stated this in a joint press briefing with members of the Presidential Campaign Council in Anambra, led by widow of former Senate President, late Senator Chuba Okadigbo, Senator Margery. Ejidike said: “All arrangements have been made, and of course you can see now that the VIP stand is being decorated, and also the stage is being set up. “Adequate security arrangements have also been made, and we are looking forward to witnessing the mother of all rallies in the state. “We have held a meeting with all the ward chairmen of our party in the state, 356 of them, and they have been mobilized to ensure that members from all wards in the state are brought down here on Tuesday. “We are working hand in hand with the presidential campaign council in Anambra, let by our mummy, Senator Margery Okadigbo, and we hope for up to 100 members of our party from each ward in the state. “You can see that all of us are around to ensure that everything is going well. We have not had any hitches at all. Anambra is the melting pot of Igbo politics, and we are ready to deliver.” The chairman also addressed rumours of alleged protest by some youths of the party, over unwillingness to disburse funds for the running of expenses for the forthcoming rally, saying that it was untrue. “Those people you mentioned are not our members. Funds have been released to all concerned, including to ward chairmen for the mobilisation of our members. So, the rumours of protest as a result of non-disbursement of funds is not true.”
