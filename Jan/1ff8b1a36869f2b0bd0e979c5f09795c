A support group for the Presidential Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Arewa for Asiwaju has lauded the candidate for speaking out against the January 31st deadline set to end the swap of the old Naira notes. The group claimed Tinubu’s Abeokuta outburst made the Federal Government extend the deadline to 10th February, saying he saved the nation from going up in flames, as a consequence of the raging public anger that pervaded the atmosphere before the sudden 10 days extension. The group’s North-Central Coordinator, Aliyu Musa Pass, in a statement, said it is the courageous attitude shown by Tinubu that saved the Nigerian commoner from suffering the pains of the initial timeline set by the Federal Government for the unpopular new currency swap. The statement explained that Tinubu has proved himself a great statesman by taking the bold and necessary step of alerting on the dangers inherent in the new naira policy, its timing and deadline.
