The Bauchi Emirate Council has appointed Alhaji Muhammad Kari as the new Wazirin Bauchi and a member of the council. The Information Officer, Babangida Jahun made the announcement on Thursday. Jahun said the new title holder would be turbannd on Friday at the Emir’s palace. Kari was appointed following the sack of Alhaji Muhammadu Bello-Kirfi on January 3. He was ousted for “disrespect and disloyalty” to Governor Bala Mohammed and the state government. The next day, Kirfi’s daughter, Sa’adatu resigned as Commissioner for Cooperatives and SMEs Development. Kirfi was Minister of State, Foreign Affairs, and Minister of Special Duties during the Shehu Shagari and Olusegun Obasanjo administrations. The All Progressives Congress (APC) has condemned his removal, noting that the Jakadan Bauchi and the Wakilin Birni suffered similar treatment. APC spokesperson, Sabo Mohammed accused the State government of undermining the traditional institution.
