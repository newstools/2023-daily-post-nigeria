Tottenham Hotspur manager, Antonio Conte has named Arsenal as the favourite team to win the Premier League title this season. Conte believes Arsenal have a great opportunity to win the English top-flight league title this season. Arsenal are currently on top of the Premier League table with five points ahead of second-placed Manchester City. Speaking during his pre-match press conference ahead of Tottenham’s Premier League derby with Arsenal on Sunday evening, Conte said: “When you are top of the league, the perception of your opponents changes totally. “You are the best team, and everybody wants to try to beat you. For sure, Arsenal has to face the situation of being favourites because they are top of the table. They have to show they are good enough to face this situation. “They have a great opportunity, working for many years on a project. They sent a lot of players out, they brought a lot of players in and they spent money to do it, and they are doing well. The former Chelsea and Inter Milan coach added, “Now, they have to show they can stay there until the end because I’m sure Manchester City doesn’t agree and will feel the real possibility to win again. I think it is a battle between Arsenal and Manchester City.”
