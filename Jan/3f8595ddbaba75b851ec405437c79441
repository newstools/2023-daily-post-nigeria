Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, commended a former President, Olusegun Obasanjo, over his endorsement of the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi as the right person to win this year’s presidential election and provide the leadership that Nigerians desire. The Governor, in a statement issued by his Special Adviser, Media & Publicity, Terver Akase, on Tuesday, insisted that if he were not a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, he would have personally led Obi’s campaign across the country. Governor Ortom strongly recommended Peter Obi to Nigerians as the man who can effectively tackle the economic, security and other challenges facing the country. According to the statement, Ortom is convinced that Obi possesses the qualities of a leader who will be a true President of this country by guaranteeing justice, equity and fairness for all Nigerians. The Governor stressed that for some years, the country has been on the verge of collapse, owing to leadership failure and its attendant consequences of poverty, heightened insecurity with banditry, kidnappings and other acts of terrorism threatening the very foundations of the nation. He said the President that Nigeria needs at this challenging time in the country’s history is one who understands the urgent need to unite the people and speedily initiate policies and actions to redirect the ship of the nation on the path of growth and development, emphasising that Peter Obi has all such qualities. Governor Ortom lauded Obasanjo for demonstrating objectivity, truth and patriotism as a statesman whose views on national issues must be taken seriously.
