Abike Dabiri-Erewa, Chairman of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, NiDCOM, on Sunday said Nigerians are not as bad as they are portrayed to be in various parts of the world. This comes in the wake of Nigerians being given a terrible reputation, suffering a series of degradations, and experiencing various assaults outside the shores of the country. Speaking during the inaugural Akure Primerose Club launch in Alagbaka axis of the state capital, the former member of the House of Representatives said all hands must be on deck to change the negative notion about Nigerians, particularly, those residing abroad. According to Dabiri, one of the biggest problems affecting the country is the wrong labelling of some of the citizens as drug dealers and fraudsters. While urging Nigerians to always speak positively to the world about Nigeria, and the great exploits of Nigerians, she emphasised that “What are we communicating? What are we saying about ourselves to the world? This is very important.” Dabiri-Erewa further stated that Nigerians are good people who are determined to succeed through hard work anywhere they find themselves. According to the NiDCOM Chairman, “the idea is that we can not do it alone. If Nigerians at home are working with those in the diaspora, we will build a better society.” She urged Akure indigenes who are making a living in the diaspora to continue to make Ondo State and the country proud with the clean records they have been portraying.
