Federal Polytechnic Nekede in Imo State has commenced investigation into the identity of a female student who gloated on TikTok. The young woman boasted on the social media platform that she graduated with the help of God and her private organ. A statement on Monday by the Registrar, Eucharia Anuna, described the comment as blasphemous and antithetical. Anuna said the student peddled the name of the Almighty in her “deleterious act” in an “unacceptable and preposterous” manner. She said the polytechnic prides itself as one with high academic and moral standards, where staff and students are aware of the consequences of any misconduct. The institution stressed that the despicable post of the student does not represent the standard of the institution. Anuna added that findings and the decision of the management would be made public after conclusion of investigations. “It is in our purview to ensure that only students found worthy in learning and character are certified,” the Registrar noted.
