The chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Ondo State chapter, Revd Fr. Anselm Ologunwa, has appealed to Nigerians to break free from the bondage of misrule. Ologunwa emphasised the importance of taking into account traits like competence, capacity, and honesty when casting votes for the advancement of Nigeria in 2023. Ologunwa made the appeal, in his New Year’s message in Akure, the Ondo State capital. According to him, Nigerians have complained loudly enough about the economic, social, and political circumstances of the country. The CAN chairman added that it is time to band together to work for the common good by fostering Christian values of love, peace, self-sacrifice and justice in society. He also admonished Nigerians to remember to cleanse their souls, which he said is where Jesus Christ, their saviour, resides, as they clean their homes and usher in the new year. The CAN chairman’s message, contained in a statement by the body’s Director of Information and Communications, Daisi Ajayi, advised Christians to celebrate moderately, act responsibly and also refrain from acts that can bring shame to their personality, government and the nation as a whole. He also urged Christians and Nigerians “to make the best use of the festive period to pray for the total eradication of insecurity [and] for unity and development of Nigeria.”
