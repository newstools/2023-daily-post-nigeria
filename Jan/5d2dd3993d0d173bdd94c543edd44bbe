Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara has slammed Chelsea defender Kalidou Koulibaly for his performances so far this season. The Senegal international who joined the Blues from SSC Napoli signed a deal in the region of £33 million last summer. Chelsea had to bring in Koulibaly, a top performer at the Africa Cup of Nations, after the likes of Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rudiger departed on free transfers. He was signed to partner Thiago Silva in the Blues central defence but while Silva has continued to show his outstanding quality well at the age of 37, Koulibaly has struggled to hit the kind of form that he often displayed for Napoli. “They look weak in midfield, weak upfront. If it wasn’t for Thiago Silva I would say they were poor at the back,” O’Hara told talkSPORT. “Kalidou Koulibaly – I don’t know what they have seen in him. because I think he’s miles off it. The rest of them, I’m not convinced at all. Bang average.”
