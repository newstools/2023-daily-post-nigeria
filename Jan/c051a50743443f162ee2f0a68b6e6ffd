The Adamawa State Police Command says it has foiled a plan by some suspected kidnappers to abduct a businessman. The command said in a statement obtained Saturday afternoon: “On the 26/1/2023, the command operatives attached to State Intelligence Bureau (SIB), in a sustained effort, foiled an organized crime to kidnap one Emmanuel Ebel, a resident of Jambutu, Yola North Local Government Area.” The statement, signed by the state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Suleiman Nguroje, said the outcome followed a reliable bit of information received about the organized crime from a good Samaritan. “The command, upon receiving the information, designed a security ring around the target and luckily engaged the suspected kidnappers,” the police stated. The command named the five-man gang as Chubrandom Nana Safinga, 30 years old; and a resident of Yaounde, Cameroon Republic, Ibrahim Tala, 32 years old; and a resident of Douala, Republic of Cameroon; Ngosso Ndjombe, 28 years old; also a resident of Douala. The other two, also from Cameroon, are Mmai Bmie Rostand, 32 years old; and Nossu Ngambewo Ricky, 27 years old. The Adamawa Police Command reiterated that the five are all illegal immigrants from the neighboring Cameroon Republic who were arrested some minutes before they could implement their organized crime.
