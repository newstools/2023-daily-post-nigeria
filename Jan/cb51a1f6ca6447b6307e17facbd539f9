The Delta State gubernatorial candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Deacon Ken Pela today expressed confidence that the 2023 elections will hold peacefully despite the security challenges in the Country. Deacon Pela made the assertion during a conversation with newsmen shortly after an interactive session with gubernatorial candidates in Warri. The interactive session was organized by the Delta State Chapter of the Association of Professional Bodies of Nigeria, APBN. “I am confident that the election will be peaceful and there’s no beating an idea whose time has come. “In this case, I believe it is ordained for change to happen in this country and I believe it will happen peacefully. “We had a peaceful transition in 2015, we will have an even more peaceful transition in 2023,” he said. Deacon Pela also urged Nigerians, especially Deltans, to obtain their Permanent Voter Cards, PVCs, in order for them to support and vote for candidates of their choice. He said Nigerians are clamouring for the Labour Party to take over the reins of leadership in the Country. According to him: “Everywhere you go in the Country, [you hear] Obidient! Labour Party! The excitement for change is high all over the country. I am sure that even the majority of those who already have their PVCs are just gearing up for change.”
