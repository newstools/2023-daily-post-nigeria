Everton legend, Alan Stubbs has expressed his disappointment after Alex Iwobi picked up an injury in Friday night’s Emirates FA Cup clash against Manchester United. The Nigeria international was badly tackled by Holland defender, Tyrell Malacia in the second half of the encounter at Old Trafford. Iwobi was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by Frenchman Abdoulaye Dacoure. The 26-year-old has featured regularly for the Toffees this season and there are fears he could be set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines. The midfielder is expected to undergo a scan, Saturday to determine the extent of the injury. Stubbs stated that Everton, who are fighting relegation can’t afford to lose Iwobi to injury for a long spell. “Alex Iwobi has just gone over on his ankle and the ankle has gone inside. I’m hoping he hasn’t done his ankle ligaments because it looks like that,” Stubbs told the BBC. “I’m hoping what we’re seeing now is just precautionary but Iwobi looks upset. Players know when something is bad.”
