Thousands of people in Adamawa State have defected from the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Some of the former NNPP members who matched through some streets of the state capital, Yola, on Friday were seen wearing Kwakwassiya caps, made popular by the NNPP national leader, Rabiu Kwankwaso. They were, however, chanting PDP slogans and voicing their support for the PDP Presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar and the Adamawa State governorship candidate, Ahmadu Fintiri. The leader of the crowd, a former Northeast zonal secretary of NNPP, Dr Babayo Liman said they were defecting from the NNPP because the party was in crisis in many states and the national leader who also seeks to be president had proved unable to resolve them. Babayo who is from Bauchi State, had announced his defection earlier in the week, saying he was invited by his supporters in Adamawa to lead them into the PDP. “I have been receiving invitations from various states and when I got here (Adamawa), they told me they wished to follow my footsteps,” he said, stating that no less than 400,000 people were leaving the NNPP to PDP in Adamawa State. He introduced those who followed him to the press briefing which took place at the NUJ Press Centre in Yola, as former officials of the NNPP across the 21 LGAs of Adamawa State. In the course of the press briefing, the former NNPP members removed their Kwankwsssiya caps to symbolise their exit from the NNPP.
