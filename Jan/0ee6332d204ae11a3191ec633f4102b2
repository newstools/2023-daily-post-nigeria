Kenneth Okonkwo, the spokesperson of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has insisted that President Muhammadu Buhari lacks capacity. Okonkwo gave the assertion on Tuesday morning while fielding questions on Arise TV’s morning show. The veteran Nollywood actor was reacting to Buhari’s comments that nobody can blackmail him because he has no house outside Nigeria. “When he [Buhari] tells you he doesn’t have a house anywhere [outside Nigeria], he is being sincere about it,” Okonkwo said. “I can tell you the closest I reached to President Buhari. I can tell you that there has not been any proof of any personal corruption in his name. “No doubt about that, but that is talking about character, and that is why we are saying the three Cs are the irreducible minimum for the next president. “Because character is not enough, you must have capacity. You must have competence. President Buhari is lacking in capacity maybe because of his age, I don’t know. “Because a man who has sat in the hospital for eight months outside Nigeria when he is the president certainly will lose track of certain events. Maybe his competence may be questionable. As you know, his certificate is still being doubted whether he did his primary school or secondary school. So we need these three Cs.”
