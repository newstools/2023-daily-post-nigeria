Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has told his players that their body language has to be better, following their FA Cup exit in the hands of Brighton. The Reds threw away a one-goal lead to lose 2-1 at the Amex. Harvey Elliott opened the scoring in the 30th minute, but the hosts hit back through a deflected Tariq Lamptey strike and a stoppage-time winner from Kaoru Mitoma. The defeat meant Liverpool’s FA Cup title defence came to an abrupt end. Klopp’s men have also won just three in nine games since the World Cup break, which included a 3-0 defeat to Brighton two weeks ago. However, Klopp said his team’s display was better than their recent visit. “We came here after a couple of weeks with one of the worst performances in my time here, so today it was much better, but still we conceded two goals from set pieces. “So now we closed the gaps where they passed through last time, but they scored from set pieces. “We still have space for improvement. We make steps but we have to improve, we have to go further on and we will do that,” Klopp told reporters after the match.
