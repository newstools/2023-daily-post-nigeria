Former Liverpool star, Danny Murphy, has hit out at Chelsea over their transfer activity under the club’s co-owner Todd Boehly this season after the Blues completed the signing of Mykhaylo Mudryk in a deal worth €100 million from Shakhtar Donetsk over the weekend. Murphy branded Boehly’s spending spree at Chelsea as absolutely preposterous, illogical and ludicrous. Speaking on talkSPORT, Murphy said, “It is absolutely preposterous, it is ludicrous, it is illogical, and it is not helpful in the short-term or the long-term, as Graham Potter just said. “I think he is sitting at home in the evening thinking, ‘What the hell is going on?’ There is no way he is sanctioned for all these. He brought in some of his own recruitment people.” He added, “Todd Boehly takes himself out of the firing line and brings in two guys, one was the technical director, one was a sporting director. There are a lot of chefs in the kitchen, a lot of people who are supposed to be doing one job, too many for my liking.”
