The actress threw social media users into a moment of frenzy after sharing photos and information about her godfathers alongside a note of appreciation for their continuous support. The two godfathers are a Zambian business mogul and owner of African Union Holdings, James Ndambo, and the CEO of Crystal TV in Ghana, Chief Paul Crystal. Taking to her Instagram page, the 37-year-old struck some poses with the elderly men in what appeared like a private jet while describing them as great support systems, adding that they always keep her grounded. Sharing the pictures, she wrote: “I’m so blessed to have a great support system. My Godfather and family keep me grounded always. “ Never forget who you are, and always remember where you’re coming from. Always stay grounded and humble. “As he always says. Chief Paul Crystal (Crystal Tv Group) and Mr. James Ndambo (Africa Union Aviation).” Reacting to the post, Nigerians took to the comment section to question the type of relationship she’s keeping with two foreign men. @freemanvicky: “Godfather and Goddaughter.” @deladem_soars: “Godfather in Ghana?, You mean Sugar Daddy’s.
