Chelsea boss, Graham Potter, has revealed that winger Christian Pulisic is disappointed because he will be out of action for a couple of months due to an injury. Potter disclosed this on Friday during his pre-match press conference ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League tie with Crystal Palace on Sunday. Pulisic sustained an injury during Chelsea’s Premier League tie with Man City last week. “He is a couple of months out,” said Potter. “He is disappointed, but he is optimistic that he can come back quicker than the two months. “So he is in that phase where he is just trying to keep his fingers crossed and hope that his rehab goes well.” Chelsea are currently in the tenth position on the Premier League table with 25 points from 18 games.
