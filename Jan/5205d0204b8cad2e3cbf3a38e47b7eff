Award-winning Nollywood actor, Lateef Adedimeji, has disclosed how he used to borrow money and clothes before going to movie auditions and almost gave up his acting career when the challenge became too much. The popular actor, who took his followers down memory lane in a story titled “Na who give up fuck up,” said he was shamed and bullied during the early years of his acting career. Adedimeji, Best Actor 2022 Best of Nollywood Awards, began acting 15 years ago. The Kudi Klepto actor, narrating his odyssey via his Instagram page, said he was never paid for movies he featured in during his early years: “Memories of the days I borrowed money to go on movie sets, borrow clothes to wear on set even though I wasn’t getting paid, I remember begging for money and food to survive.” The actor who walked down the aisle with his woman last year disclosed how grateful he was when he was paid one thousand naira for a lead role. “Then the times I finally started getting paid 1k, 2k, 5k for a lead role, I remember receiving the payments with so much joy, happiness and gratitude,” he posted.
