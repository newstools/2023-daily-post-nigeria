Popular veteran actress, Eucharia Anunobi has described people who complain about the state of the country but are yet to get their Permanent Voter’s Card, PVC, as antichrist. Eucharia said this in a video on her Instagram page. She said any politician who has no intention to redeem promises is an antichrist. She further stated that a husband snatcher and people sleeping with an underage person are antichrist. “If you are sleeping with persons of the same gender or in the same sex marriage, you are an antichrist. If you are a politician and you have no intentions to redeem your promises, you are an antichrist. ”If you are a Nigerian and you have been complaining that Nigeria is a mess and you have not gotten your PVC to vote in the coming election, you are an antichrist,” she added.
