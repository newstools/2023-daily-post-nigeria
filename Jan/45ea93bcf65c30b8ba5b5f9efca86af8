Evicted Big Brother Titans, BBTitans, housemate, Sandra Essien, has explained that her eviction from the reality show was a result of being paired with Theo Traw. Speaking with Ebuka Obi Uchendu after her eviction, Sandra noted that she had doubts about progressing in the show when she was paired with Traw, who she described as a “nonchalant person.” She said, “The moment I was paired with Traw, I was like, you have to take me out now. You know iron sharpeneth iron. I know I am the fire. But it was quite unfortunate that I was paired with the most nonchalant person ever. He’s alright, but probably not for me. “I knew people were going to put me up for eviction. I saw the removal coming. I was hoping we would stay longer, but it happened. “I get iffy because I am a fire bulb. Trying to run at my own pace, I think I had to slow down for Traw to catch up. I would have loved someone who would wake me up. I tried, but I was so iffy. I didn’t have it. “I’m not putting all the blame on him. I should have done better.” When asked if she would iron things out with Traw, Sandra said, “Traw and his negative energy should keep off.” Recall that instructive voice, Biggie, who had earlier paired all the housemates with their opposite gender, said whatever happens to a housemate would also affect the partner.
