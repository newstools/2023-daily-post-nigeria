Manchester City defender, Joao Cancelo, is set to leave the club on a loan deal to Bayern Munich, according to The Athletic. Cancelo has fallen out of favour with manager Pep Guardiola this season. The 28-year-old and Guardiola have had their ups and downs from the time he moved to the Etihad in 2019 from Juventus. However, in recent seasons Cancelo has become one of Manchester City’s standout performers contributing both defensively and in the attack. His form means that Cancelo was only a substitute in Portugal’s last two matches at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Upon his return to England, Cancelo has started only three of City’s matches and has seen Rico Lewis become the first-choice right-back even ahead of Kyle Walker.
