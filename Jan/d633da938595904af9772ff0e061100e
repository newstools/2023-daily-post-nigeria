Former champions, Enyimba and Akwa United will lit up Aba when they clash in a Nigeria Premier Football League matchday two encounter on Wednesday (today). Both teams enjoyed contrasting fortunes on matchday one and will be desperate to lay down a marker ahead of a tough and rigorous campaign. Enyimba started the campaign on a resounding note edging out Nasarawa United 2-1 away on Sunday. Akwa United on the other hand were stunned 2-0 at home by NPFL newcomers, Bendel Insurance in their opening fixture. Defeat in this game will no doubt put pressure on their rookie head coach, Deji Ayeni. For eight-time champions, Enyimba, consolidating on the win against Nasarawa United will be their target in this tie. In another Group A contest, El-Kanemi Warriors will entertain Nasarawa United. Both teams lost on matchday one and will be looking for their first win of the season. OTHER FIXTURES
