Zamfara State Governor, Hon. Bello Mohammed Matawalle has vowed that the alleged Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, thugs caught with AK-47 rifles and other dangerous weapons during the party’s recent rally must be brought to justice. Addressing newsmen at his country home in Maradun town, Maradun Local Government Area of the State on Friday, Matawalle said that only security operatives were empowered by law to carry AK-47 rifles or any other sophisticated weapon. “I wonder what civilians could be doing with AK-47 rifles or other dangerous weapons if they are not terrorists”, he added. According to him, the suspects would be arraigned before a court of competent jurisdiction as soon as thorough investigations are concluded. The Governor explained that he had directed all security chiefs in the State to properly abide by the presidential order to shoot anybody caught with AK-47 rifle or any dangerous weapon during campaigns and election periods. Commenting on the State’s Anti-Thuggery Committee, Governor Matawalle debunked the claim by the PDP that the committee was established to intimidate opposition parties in the State. “After all, there are some APC supporters who were equally arrested for criminal offences and will also be prosecuted according to the law of the land irrespective of the fact that they are supporting the ruling party,” he said. He cautioned all the political parties in the State to play politics according to the rules, pointing out that power only comes from God.
