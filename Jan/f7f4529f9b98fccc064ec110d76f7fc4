The presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, Rabiu Kwankwaso, has said the only fear he has about the forthcoming presidential election is more of the Independent and National Electoral Commission, INEC, and other stakeholders in the presidential Villa. Kwankwaso also said he believed this year’s election would be different from the past elections. He disclosed this on Wednesday while fielding questions during an appearance at the Chatham House in London. The former Kano State governor lamented that corrupt politicians with deep pockets had weaponized poverty to perpetuate themselves in office. He said: “This year’s election will be different in the sense that everybody is suffering; everybody has seen the consequences of collecting money to vote for a particular candidate on the one hand. On the other hand, these people with deep pockets have made people so poor to the extent that even good food is enough to make the poor crazy. “So I believe that people, the masses from Nigeria, are very committed. Our fear now is more of the Independent and National Electoral Commission, INEC, and other stakeholders because we have seen what happened in the past. Most of these issues are centred around the Villa and the President, and not necessarily this president, the ones before inclusive. And as long as the leadership in Abuja will convince themselves to allow the people to go and vote, I have no doubt in my mind we are going to have a free, fair and credible election. “And for me, I have not seen any reason why President Buhari will not allow that to happen; probably, it is the only one or a few legacies that he will leave behind. He was the biggest beneficiary when we were in opposition promoting him, many things happened, and he became president despite the fact he had serious issues with the stakeholders in conducting elections. So we believe this election is going to be different.”
