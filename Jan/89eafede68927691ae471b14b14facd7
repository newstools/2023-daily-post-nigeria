The President of Igueben Area Customary Court, Mrs Precious Aigbonoga, has been abducted. Aigbonoga was ambushed on Monday around the Ugoneki axis as she headed to court in Igueben Local Government Area. Festus Usiobaifo, Publicity Secretary of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Benin branch, confirmed the incident. The body expressed worry over recent attacks and the kidnapping of Aigbonoga, describing her as an easygoing and hardworking judicial officer. The court president is the wife of Afebu Aigbonoga, a PDP House of Assembly Candidate for Etsako West Constituency 1.

A former Speaker of the Edo House of Assembly, Festus Ebea, commented on the incident. “He had intended to take the train for Ubiaja, but he could not since the train services had been suspended. “The family is aware of his kidnap, the police division in that area has been informed”, Ebea told NAN. The occurrences followed Saturday’s abduction of 32 passengers waiting to board a train from the Igueben Station in Edo to Warri in Delta.
