A Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday dismissed a suit by a former presidential candidate of Hope Democratic Party, HDP, Chief Ambrose Albert Owuru, against the election of President Muhammadu Buhari, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the 2019 presidential election. The suit seeking the outright sack of President Buhari was thrown out by Justice Inyang Edem Ekwo on three major grounds. Parts of the grounds are that the suit constituted a gross abuse of court process, statute barred and was an affront to the supremacy of the Supreme Court of Nigeria. Besides, Justice Ekwo held that the suit was baseless, frivolous, irritating and vexatious in its entirety. Owuru had, in the suit, applied for an order of court to declare the presidential seat vacant and swear him in as the authentic winner of that election. Details later.
