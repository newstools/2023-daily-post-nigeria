A former National Vice President of National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) and chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, Comrade Anya S. Anya, has taken a swipe at the Governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodinma, over the deteriorating insecurity challenges ravaging many parts of the state. Anya, who currently doubles as the Southeast Coordinator of Coalition of Saraki Advocates for Atiku (COSAA), was baring his minds in a statement on Thursday, against the backdrops of a recent repeated onslaught on Aku Ihube and Umulolo local communities in Okigwe Local Government Area of the state by suspected operatives of Ebubeagu regional security outfit. He said, “In line with this Aku, Ihube and Umulolo wards all in Okigwe LGA remains case studies of these repeated onslaughts on its citizens at the behest of the Governor’s directives.” Continuing, Anya also regretted the actions by the APC-controlled administration in Imo and further accused the state government of policitiziation of the persisting security problems besetting the eastern state.
