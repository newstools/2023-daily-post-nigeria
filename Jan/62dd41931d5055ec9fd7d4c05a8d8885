Chelsea manager, Graham Potter, has said Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang missed the 4-0 defeat at Manchester City in the FA Cup due to a back injury. Aubameyang looked unhappy during the 1-0 defeat to City in the Premier League on Thursday, after he was substituted as a substitute in the second half. The 33-year-old signed for Chelsea just days before Thomas Tuchel was sacked as manager. He has scored only one league goal since his move to Stamford Bridge. Aubameyang was expected to start the FA Cup third-round tie at the Etihad, but was not even included in the match day squad. “Auba felt pain in his back ahead of this one,” Potter said.
