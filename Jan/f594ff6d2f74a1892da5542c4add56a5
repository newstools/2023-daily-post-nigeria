The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Culture, Art and Tourism, Mrs Abosede Adaran, has charged the indigenous socio-group known as Egbe Akomolede Yoruba to involve all the stakeholders in reviving the Yoruba language. This advice was made when Adaran played host to the leadership of Egbe Akomolede Yoruba in her office in Ado Ekiti. The Yoruba indigenous group was charged to involve in the sensitization of all the stakeholders which include the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, All Nigeria Confederation of Principals of Secondary Schools (ANCOPSS), Parents/Teachers Association, Christian Association of Nigeria and others. The permanent secretary implored the group to embark on a mobile education on the importance of the Yoruba language and cultural value in order to showcase the heritage of the tribe and to bail out the language from going into extinction. Adaran also reiterated the commitment of the Biodun Oyebanji Administration towards the promotion of art, culture and tourism across the world. Speaking on behalf of the group, the chairman of Egbe Akomolede Yoruba (Ekiti State chapter), Akogun Olumuyiwa Akinrelere solicited the support of the ministry in totality and promised to always carry the ministry along in all its programmes. He also reminded the permanent secretary of the International Language Day coming soon, stressing that the group would be expecting the performance of the ministryâ€™s standing troupe at the programme to mark the day.
