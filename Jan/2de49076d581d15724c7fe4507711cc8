Portugal’s new manager Roberto Martinez has made an honest claim about Al Nassr’s player Cristiano Ronaldo. Martinez was confirmed as the new Portugal boss replacing Fernando Santos on Monday. He was sacked from his position as Belgium manager immediately after the World Cup. Martinez has now opened up on Ronaldo, claiming he has yet to meet the players. “Decisions have to be made on the pitch. I want to meet everyone, and starting today. “Cristiano is part of that list, he spent 19 years with the national team and deserves respect, let’s talk,” he added. “Tomorrow we’ll start working, getting to know all the players, and Cristiano is one of them.”
