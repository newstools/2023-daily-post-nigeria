Chelsea manager, Graham Potter, has fired back at his critics, insisting that the club is no longer under Roman Abramovich. The Blues are in the middle of a patchy run of form that has seen them win once in eight games. The Boehly-Clearlake consortium bought the Blues from Abramovich for £2.5 billion. Under Abramovich, Chelsea employed a ruthless strategy when it came to hiring and firing coaches. However, Potter said that approach from the top has changed significantly since the Americans took over. “There’s completely different ownership than there was. This is hard for people to get their heads around because Chelsea for 20 years has been one thing, and now all of a sudden it’s different,” Potter said. “It’s not like I jumped at the first opportunity to move from Brighton. This move felt like the right one because of the owners, because of the support that I thought they would give and that’s proven to be the case, they’ve been fantastic.”
