Former Atletico Madrid centre-back, Diego Godin, has chosen Paris Saint-Germain’s Lionel Messi over Al-Nassr’s Cristiano Ronaldo as the tougher player to defend against. Godin played against both Messi and Ronaldo during his time at Atletico Madrid between 2010 and 2019. Messi and Ronaldo won several La Liga titles and the Champions League during their time at Barcelona and Real Madrid, respectively. “For me, it’s more difficult to mark Messi. We are contemporaries. All my time in Europe I had the bad luck of coinciding with both of them,” Godin said on ESPN Uruguay. He added, “They took several titles from us at Atletico Madrid. Without Messi at Barcelona or Cristiano at Real Madrid, we would’ve some league safer and maybe some Champions League. “We managed to compete with the generation of these monsters.”
