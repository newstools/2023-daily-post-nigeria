One of the spokespersons for the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Ndi Kato, has called out the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, for engaging in what she described as “shady dealings.” The statement was contained in a post via her Twitter handle on Thursday. Kato alleged that the Electoral Commission had secretly changed its deadline for the submission of party agents from 20 January to 18 January 2023. She said the development was noticed after INEC had shut down its website Wednesday night. Kato also warned the commission not to engage in shady dealings capable of costing Nigerians this year’s election. She wrote, “@inecnigeria your shady dealings may cost Nigerians this important election. You gave 20th January as the initial deadline for parties to upload their agents, and then you quietly shut down the portal last night being 18th and then went to your website to change the date to 18th. @inecnigeria WHY DID YOU END REGISTRATION OF POLLING UNIT AGENTS ON THE 18TH AFTER TELLING NIGERIANS IT IS THE 20TH.”
