With less than a few weeks to the 2023 general election, the Emir of Dutse in Jigawa State, HRH Alhaji Nuhu Mohammed Sanusi, has said the Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has the capacity to rule the country. Sanusi insisted that Tinubu has demonstrated this in his past record of service as Lagos State governor and other political activities. He stated this at the weekend when Tinubu visited him in Dutse on the sidelines of the APC’s campaign rally in Jigawa State. According to him, Tinubu helped to bring the North and South regions together to form a strong political party. Sanusi said: “I am a keen follower of you and your political activities. You are one person I believe have the capacity and competence to rule the country. “Nigeria had been polarised before. You were able to bring the North and South together under this administration. The Emir added, “You also went to America to study just like me. And like you, I also did several menial jobs to survive. “I am also an Accountant like you. I’ve also read some of your books, particularly the one titled ‘Financialism’. The only thing I lack, unlike you, is the will to play politics,” he said.
