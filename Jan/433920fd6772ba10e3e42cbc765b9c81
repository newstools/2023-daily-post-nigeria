Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has said Mikel Arteta could have replaced him at the Etihad, but he “didn’t wait” for the top job. Guardiola gave Arteta his first coaching role when he was appointed as his assistant in 2016. He spent three-and-a-half years working with Guardiola, before taking the Arsenal manager’s job in December 2019. Guardiola has now said he could have succeeded him as City boss had he stuck around longer. “I am pretty sure if I would have left before, he would be here and he would be the best, absolutely. “But I extended the contract, I am sorry, and he didn’t wait, so it could not happen, but definitely [he could have been City manager],” Guardiola said.
