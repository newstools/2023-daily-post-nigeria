Arsenal legend, Ian Wright, has snubbed the likes of Arsenal’s Mikel Arteta, Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola and Newcastle United’s Eddie Howe and named Brighton’s Roberto de Zerbi as his Premier League Manager of the Season. Wright said he was happy for De Zerbi, whose team currently sits in the sixth position with 31 points. Speaking on The Wrighty’s House podcast on Spotify, Wright didn’t name Arteta or Howe as his Premier League manager of the season. He said, “I am delighted for De Zerbi. Delighted for him. It was Graeme Souness that was talking about who he is What is his experience in this league? My gosh. “I don’t think anyone’s come in and has been so impressive in the way he is gone. I’m probably going to go with him as my tip.”
