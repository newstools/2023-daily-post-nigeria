Former Kogi West Senator, Dino Melaye has said the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar is not afraid of investigation. Speaking against the background of alleged money laundering, Melaye said Atiku is the most investigated Nigerian. The spokesman of the PDP Presidential Campaign Council disclosed this while featuring on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Monday. Melaye said Atiku has always submitted himself for investigation. “Atiku Abubakar is a democrat; he’s a Nigerian. He has always been available for investigation. He has been investigated time and time again and come out very clean with clean status. “So, you do not need the permission of Atiku to investigate him. We are not afraid of an investigation, because he’s the most investigated Nigerian and if you investigate him again he will come out clean,” he said. Melaye stressed that Atiku’s counterpart in the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu should be investigated and prosecuted. “He is the one that has been indicted already in a certified court indictment. He is the man that has faced the Code of Conduct before,” he said.
