Big Brother Titans stars, Lukay and Ipeleng have become the first housemates to entangle in sexual intercourse in the Titans’ House. It would rather come as a shock to many viewers and even some of the housemates because they are among the most reserved housemates in the show. The two housemates, both South Africans, were caught having sex in the garden after the Pool party on Thursday night. A few other housemates, Marvin, Jaypee and Yvonne witnessed the show as their moaning caught everyone’s attention The 37-year-old Lukay and Ipeleng, 25, started showing signs of intimacy earlier in the afternoon when they were seen kissing in public. Many followers of the show might be surprised by the fact that unlike other female housemates who walk around the house scantily dressed, Ipeleng is always fully clad. Ipeleng and Lukay are now officially the first housemates to have sex in the reality show after which the 5″9 feet tall female housemate could be seen disposing of the used condom and washing her hands. The BBTitans reality show is now approaching its second week as housemates from Nigeria and South Africa try to settle under one roof.
