The Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba and three of his officers are to face contempt charges before a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) over their continued disobedience and disregard to the lawful order of the Court. A High Court of the FCT judiciary had on December 14, 2022, restrained the IGP and his officers from taking any action against a litigant, Abubakar Umar Shagari pending the resolution of issues brought before the court. The order of the Court is in respect of a suit marked FCT/HC/CV/3407/2022 instituted by Abubakar Umar Shagari against the Inspector General of Police and three others. However, in flagrant disobedience and disregard to the order of the Court, the respondents, especially, the staff of the DCP Ayuba Usman of the IGP Special Tactical Squad invaded the residence of the said Abubakar Umar Shagari in Ssokoto on January 23, 2023. During the unlawful invasion, the respondents ransacked the entire building and arrested the aged mother, two wives and two children of the plaintiff and had since hauled them into unlawful custody. Counsel to the plaintiff, Blessing Anazodo who issued the threat to file contempt charges against the respondents asked them to conduct their statutory functions within the ambit of the law. The lawyer pleaded with the IGP and his officers to obey the court order and release the aged mother, two wives and two children of the plaintiff forthwith or be ready to face contempt proceedings. She also indicated enforcement of monetary damages against the respondents jointly and severally unless they respect the order of the Court in the matter.
