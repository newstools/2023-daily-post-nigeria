The African-American lady, Vonapolouis Moss, who was allegedly swindled by a suspected internet fraudster, Awoleye Joshua Oluwatofunmi, is back in the United States of America. Awoleye Joshua, who claimed to be an HND 1 student of the Kwara State Polytechnic, Ilorin, a claim dismissed by the institution’s management, allegedly defrauded the lady of thousands of dollars under a fake relationship which collapsed on her arrival to Nigeria. The Kwara State Police Commissioner, Paul Odama, disclosed this to newsmen while parading suspected criminals, including kidnap suspects, at the state police command headquarters in Ilorin on Monday. He said, as promised by the police command recently, concerned authorities were reached to ensure the safe return of the African-American lady to her country. “The lady has been flown back to the US, she is safe in the US now, while the suspect, Awoleye Joshua, has been charged to court and remanded, the case will continue,” the police commissioner stated. DAILY POST recalls that Vonapolouis Moss of Indiana, United States of America, was lured by Awoleye Joshua to Nigeria under a suspicious and questionable romantic relationship. Vonapolouis, in a chat with journalists in Ilorin before her return to the US, had said after her bitter experience that ” I just want to go back home” amid tears, “I think it is a lesson learnt.” She said, “I have been helping people and would not want anything bad to happen to him. “I don’t know what else to say, besides I see Nigeria as a beautiful place, I have never lived in a place with a lot of black people, I see so many beautiful black people living in one place.” “The hospitality of the people is so amazing, it is a beautiful place and I would love to come back with my family,” she added.
