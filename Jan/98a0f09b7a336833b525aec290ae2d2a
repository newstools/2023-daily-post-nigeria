The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB, has said prospective candidates can no longer register for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME, without providing their email addresses. JAMB said the policy would take effect from 31st January 2023. The board affirmed that the review of its advisory on the ongoing UTME registration was to ensure best practices are followed in the process of capturing all relevant data pertaining to candidates. The board added that the latest advisory, aside from aiding in eliciting relevant and up-to-date data of candidates, will also facilitate cheap and efficient transmission of urgent and vital communication to candidates. A statement by Fabian Benjamin, JAMB’s Head of Public Affairs and Protocol, said the email provides more flexibility in communication and is a more professional way of reaching out to candidates. “Candidates are, therefore, advised to get their genuine email addresses before proceeding with UTME registration. In addition, candidates are to ensure that their passwords are kept securely as the board does not retrieve lost email passwords or change email addresses once registered,” he said.
