The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has said political gladiators in Imo State are behind the murder attempt on the former Governor of the state, Ikedi Ohakim. This was as IPOB said Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State created political assassination thugs he can manipulate to blackmail its members. Recall that some gunmen had attacked Ohakim at Oriagu in the Ehime Mbano Local Government Area of the state. Reacting, IPOB’s spokesman, Emma Powerful asked Uzodinma to explain to Nigerians the assassination attempts in the state. A statement by Powerful: “The attack was masterminded by the political gladiators in Imo State who were desperate to murder political opponents in the state to further their own careers. “Everybody must ask Hope Uzodinma what is happening in Imo state because he created the political assassination thugs thinking he can manipulate and blackmail the public against IPOB.” Powerful condemned the assassination attempt on Ikedia claiming the former Governor was a peaceful politician. He insisted that those behind the attack wanted to score a political goal. “Ohakim is one of the peaceful people among the politicians in the Eastern region. “We understand that the attack was planned to achieve a political goal by the enemies of Imo indigenes,” he added.
