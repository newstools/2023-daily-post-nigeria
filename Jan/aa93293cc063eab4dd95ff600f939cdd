Former Tottenham Hotspur manager, Tim Sherwood, has urged Arsenal to think twice about launching an improved bid for Brighton’s Moises Caicedo. Sherwood also suggested an alternative signing Arsenal should go for, instead of Caicedo. Arsenal are desperate to strengthen their midfield options before the January transfer window closes on Tuesday night, with Mohamed Elneny set to miss the rest of the season and Albert Sambi Lokonga low on confidence and struggling for form. The Gunners have already seen a bid of £60 million rejected by Brighton for Caicedo and are contemplating submitting an improved offer for the Ecuador international midfielder. “I think the kid needs to look at it very carefully. He’s got to look at it his mate Bissouma who has gone to Tottenham,” Sherwood told Sky Sports. “Everyone was lauding this boy, asking where he was going to go. Take his pick, Liverpool? He’s ended up at Tottenham and has not played. “I’m not saying it is his fault entirely but sometimes you can look a world beater in a Brighton shirt but when they step and play for a huge club it does not happen for them. “If everyone is fit he doesn’t play. We have dug out some highlights, do you see a £70 million player for someone who can run around and tackle? “His passing range isn’t fantastic, he scores a goal once in a blue moon.” He continued: “For me I think it is an awful lot of money, I think there are better options out there for Arsenal and Tielemans would be another Leicester player I am selling for Brendan.”
