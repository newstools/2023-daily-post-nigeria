Anambra State Governor, Charles Soludo has said the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi may win the forthcoming presidential poll in his State. The former Central Bank Governor, who spoke, Thursday, on Channels Television’s Politics Today programme, also wished Obi well in his presidential ambition. Recall that Soludo had, a few months ago, faulted Obi’s presidential ambition, saying he (Obi) will not win the February election. In a piece which literally set the internet ablaze, Soludo rubbished Obi’s performance while serving as governor of Anambra State, stressing that the achievement of the LP candidate in the State was relatively nothing. Referring to the article, Soludo said, “In that piece, I even considered that Peter Obi might win in Anambra State. I did mention that,” he said but doubted the possibility of the LP presidential candidate to win the overall election. “I wish Peter Obi the best of luck. Let him go and compete as others.”
