Atalanta winger, Ademola Lookman is not in any way surprised with his impressive displays for the club this season. Lookman has been a revelation for La Dea following his arrival for €9m from Bundesliga club, RB Leipzig last summer. The 25-year-old scored his 12th league goal of the campaign in La Dea’s 2-0 win against Sampdoria on Saturday night. Only his compatriot Victor Osimhen, who plays for league leaders, Napoli have scored more goals (13) than him in the Italian top-flight this season. Lookman struggled during his stint at Everton and RB Leipzig but he always believes he has what it takes to excel at the highest level. “Yes! Of course, I expected it. Maybe it’s a surprise to you, but I know what I can bring, I know what I can do. The team is the most important thing,” the Nigeria international told Sky Sport Italia. “Different circumstances and different scenarios made me who I am today and that’s me as a whole person. I think I’m in the right moment, doing the right things, keep staying disciplined in what I do.”
