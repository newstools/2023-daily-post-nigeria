Veteran Nigerian rapper, Eedris Abdulkareem, has showered accolades on his wife for standing by him during his battle with kidney failure. The ‘Jaga Jaga’ crooner revealed he was surprised when his wife offered to be his kidney donor although he has always known she could do anything for him. “I had always known that she could do anything for me; just like she knows that I can do anything for her. It has always been that way with us.” DAILY POST recalls that Nigerian rapper, MI Abaga had a few months ago disclosed Eedris’s battle with Kidney failure. However, the entertainer disclosed that during one of his appointments, he was informed that only a family member can source for the kidney. Speaking on the TVC entertainment programme, ESplash, the rapper who has dedicated a song, ‘Thank you’ to his wife said; “There are a lot of ways I have been showing my jewel of inestimable value my unalloyed appreciation for what she has done for me and I will never get tired of doing that. She is the most awesome person alive. “She is actually my Siamese twin and our bond is unbreakable. Making a special song for her is one of those things I am doing to thank her, though this is not the first song I have dedicated to her ‘royal loveliness.” The outspoken artist further said he chose to pray for his soulmate rather than chase after more money or fame adding that he didn’t want to be a gold digger. “While coming up in the industry as a young guy, I had the option of marrying for more money and high society connections. But, I refused to be a gold digger and clout chaser, and instead diligently worked and prayed for my soul mate.” He urged young people to marry for love as it is the ultimate thing. “The day I saw her, I knew immediately that I had found my missing rib. My advice to young people out there is that they should marry for love; not any other thing,” he added.
