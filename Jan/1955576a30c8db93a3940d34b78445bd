A spokesman for the presidential campaign council of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Festus Keyamo has filed a suit at the Federal High court, Abuja against the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, and the Independent Corrupt Practices, Offences and Other Related Crimes Commission, ICPC, demanding the arrest and prosecution of Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. The Minister of State for Labour, Employment and Productivity in the suit is asking the EFCC, and the ICPC to arrest and prosecute Atiku Abubakar. The suit followed the expiration of the 72-hour ultimatum he earlier gave to the anti-graft agencies to swing into action in effecting the arrest of the former Vice President with regards to an alleged revelation by a self-acclaimed whistleblower, Michael Achimugu. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria’s earlier letter, dated January 16, was addressed to the Chairmen of EFCC, ICPC and CBC. He is now demanding an arrest as his request in the letter was not honoured until the ultimatum expired. Keyamo claims Atiku should be arrested and prosecuted for alleged offences against the Code of Conduct for Public Officers, Money Laundering, Criminal Breach of Trust and Criminal Misappropriation, and Conspiracy. Recall that Atiku’s ex-aide, Michael Achimugu released some controversial videos a fortnight ago, claiming that between 1999 and 2007 when Atiku was Vice President, he colluded with ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo to fleece the country using what he termed “Special Purpose Vehicles” (SPVs).
