The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) has said Atiku Abubakar will win Kogi State. Head of Media and Publicity, Austin Ochu predicted victory for the party on Monday, NAN reports. The All Progressives Congress (APC) Campaign Council in Kogi had accused the PDP of hiring supporters. Referring to last Saturday’s campaign rally, the party claimed the crowd was rented from neighbouring States. Reacting, Ochu said the allegation was “strange and laughable” as the PDP never engaged in such. The spokesperson noted that the APC is jittery about going into next month’s contest. The official said Nigerians “desperately want change…the time for that change is now”. He called Kogi a PDP State, adding that the party was ready to make amends and assume power. “We only faltered along the way but thank God we have gone back to the trenches,” he said. The APC has been “flapping around” because the message “is very clear that the game is over”, Ochu added.
