A member of the House of Representatives, Shamshudeen Danbazau, has said the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu will win in Kano State, despite Rabiu Kwankwaso being in the race. Danbazau, during a press briefing on Thursday, said that though Kwankwaso is a respectable name in Kano, but the dynamic nature of the 2023 race and the “spoiler effect” will give victory to Tinubu. He stated that Peter Obi and Kwankwaso will divide the opposition votes to ensure victory for Tinubu. “I am telling you without mincing words that Bola Ahmed Tinubu is the man with the gravitas, that has the capacity and the experience to take Nigeria in all the issues facing the country,” he said. Speaking on the security situation in the country under the APC-led government, the lawmaker said the government has succeeded in stopping bomb attacks on major cities across the north. “So, we have made progress now because I recall that between 2014 and the end of 2015. For that period, I refused to go for any Eid-el prayer. I used to go for Friday prayers, I stayed at home or went to the barracks to pray. But now, since around 2016, I have not missed any Eid-el prayer, and I have not missed a Juma’at prayer. So that speaks a lot.”
