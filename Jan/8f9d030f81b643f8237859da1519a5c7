Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand, has said he would be “pretty shocked” if manager ten Hag starts Fred and Scott McTominay in midfield against Arsenal. United will be without Casemiro for the trip to the Emirates after he picked up his fifth yellow card of the campaign against Crystal Palace. Sunday’s clash represents a good chance for ten Hag’s men to cut Arsenal’s lead at the top of the table. Ferdinand expects ten Hag to start Lisandro Martinez in midfield and stick with Luke Shaw at centre-back. “There’s no getting away from the fact that Casemiro will be a big miss against Arsenal this weekend. “With him (Casemiro) out, I’d imagine ten Hag will shuffle the pack with Luke Shaw back at centre back, [Tyrell] Malacia at left back and [Lisandro] Martinez into central midfield. “In all honesty, I’d be pretty shocked if ten Hag went with Fred and Scott McTominay in midfield as that doesn’t seem to work,” Ferdinand told William Hill.
