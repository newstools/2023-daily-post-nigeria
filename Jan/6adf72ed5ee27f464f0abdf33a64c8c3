Racing driver, Al-Attiyah, has claimed that Paris Saint-Germain forward, Lionel Messi, will follow Al-Nassr star Cristiano Ronaldo to Saudi Arabia after his contract with the Parisians expires. Al-Attiyah, who is the Dakar champion and leading the current edition, insisted that it would be difficult for Messi to return to Barcelona after playing for PSG. “It is difficult for Messi to go back to Barcelona after PSG. PSG are a rich club, and they have a clear plan,” Al-Attiyah told Mundo Deportivo. “What I think now is that an Arabian club will, in a few months, sign Messi. And I can tell you which one: I’m sure he will go to Al Hilal.” He added: “He won’t return to Barca. He will go to Saudi Arabia, like Ronaldo. There is a lot of money here, and players are looking for a big contract.”
