The leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Sunday berated top candidates in the forthcoming presidential election for not addressing issues being faced by the country in their campaign. In a statement by his Media Aide, Osho Oluwatosin, Primate Ayodele noted that presidential candidates say they want to do everything but were yet to speak about how they will do it. He mentioned that the country is facing economic issues, insecurity, and education problems, but the candidates are not seriously addressing any of these in their campaigns. Ayodele expressed fears that Nigerians may not be free from the problems they are facing at the moment because the candidates are not addressing them. “Presidential candidates are only looking for votes, they have not addressed issues, they are saying they can do all which isn’t possible. They are not really discussing issues; we are facing insecurity, economic, education problems, they have not explained how they will tackle this. “Are we sure we are heading towards an election because those that want to represent us have not come out to let us know how they will handle these problems we are facing. We may still end up facing the same problems in the next dispensation because they are not addressing these issues.”
