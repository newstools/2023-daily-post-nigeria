British ace broadcaster, Piers Morgan has insisted that Cristiano Ronaldo is better than Lionel Messi. Many thought the debate on who is the best player between the two football lords would come to an end when Messi won the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The Argentina international is still in the Champions League competing with Paris Saint-Germain, while Ronaldo, on the other hand, has left Europe entirely, But Piers Morgan, the Portuguese superstar’s friend, believes that the former Real Madrid man still has the “edge” over his Argentine counterpart. “Thanks to the fall-out from our interview, Ronaldo signed the biggest transfer deal in football history, and is now the world’s highest-paid athlete, at the age of 37,” he told Tatler. “He’s also doing what he’s done throughout his career, and which for me gives him the edge over Messi, and that’s challenging himself in a new country, and new league, at a time when football in the Middle East is really taking off, as we saw at the Qatar World Cup where Morocco reached the semi-finals and Saudi Arabia beat the eventual winners, Messi’s Argentina.”
