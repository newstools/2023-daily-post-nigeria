The Executive Secretary, National Board for Technical Education, Professor Idris Mohammed Bugaje, on Saturday, said mass communication has been split into three categories, as a course of study. He said unlike in the past, mass communication is now split into Journalism and Media Studies, Strategic Communication and Media Studies and then Film and Multimedia Production, adding that a student can specialize in one aspect. Speaking during the closing of a five-day critique of the new curriculum of the courses by major stakeholders in Kaduna, on Saturday, Bugaje, who was represented by his
