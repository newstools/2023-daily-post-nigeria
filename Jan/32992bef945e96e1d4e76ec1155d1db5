A member of the Psquare music group, Paul Okoye, popularly known as Rudeboy, has questioned why tertiary institutions are still in session amid the ongoing collection of Permanent Voters Card, PVC. In a tweet on his verified handle on Thursday, the music star opined that most of the students registered for the PVC in their various states during the prolonged strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU. He wondered why they are still kept back in school even as the deadline for PVC collection elapses in the next 10 days. “Out of the 74 million youths eligible voters, 26 million of them are students and they are all back in school, most of them registered during the ASUU strike. “It’s 10days remaining for collection, @inecnigeria why are students still in school by now?” He asked.
