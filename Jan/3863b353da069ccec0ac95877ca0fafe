Chelsea boss, Graham Potter has explained that Manchester City won the Blues 1-0 at Stamford Bridge because his team “committed too many men too high” to press the visitors. Potter also said he felt for his Chelsea players, urging them to stick together going forward after their latest defeat to Man City. The Englishman watched as Riyad Mahrez’s second-half goal gave Pep Guardiola’s side all three points against Chelsea. “It was a much better performance when you consider everything… losing Raheem and Pulisic early. I am proud of the players in terms of everything they gave,” Potter told Sky Sports. “It is tough at the moment, I must admit. I feel for the boys, of course. We have to stick together, it is one of those times. “For their goal, I thought we committed too many men too high to press them, and then you’ve to credit their quality. I think Kepa and Marc thought each other could have dealt with it. “At the same time, emotions are high, that is how it is. You have to ride out any storm and stay level. I think the crowd today appreciated the performance, our support has been fantastic.”
