Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes, has insisted Manchester City are still favourites to win the Premier League this season. City threw away a one-goal lead to lose 2-1 to United on Saturday. Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford struck late in the game to cancel Jack Grealish’s opener. Scholes feels United are now title contenders, but still expects City to chase down Arsenal, who can go eight points clear if they beat Tottenham on Sunday. “We’ve learned that Manchester United can beat a big team when the pressure is on and when they need to. “Are they in the title race? I think you have to say they are. If they keep people fit, they are one point behind Man City now. “City are still the favourites for me, they’re still the best team in this league,” Scholes told BT Sport.
