Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has singled out striker Eddie Nketiah for praise following his side’s Premier League 3-2 win over Manchester United on Sunday. Arteta said Nketiah has an Arsenal heart following his impressive display for the Gunners against Man United at Emirates. Two goals from Nketiah and a goal from Bukayo Saka gave Arteta’s side the win over the Red Devils. Speaking at his post-match press conference after the game, Arteta said, “He [Nketiah] has an Arsenal heart. “What Eddie is doing is incredible. We were hoping that he could do that because of the way he is and his qualities. Losing Gabi was a big blow. It is a big blow losing Gabi but Eddie is responding in an exceptional way.”
