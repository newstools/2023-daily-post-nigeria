The House of Representatives has approved the restructuring of N1 trillion to fund the 2022 supplementary budget. The Committee of Supply on Tuesday approved the request for President Muhammadu Buhari to get the loan from the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN. The approval takes the entire Ways and Means loan stock to N23.7 trillion. The National Assembly had last year approved the N815 billion supplementary budget which President Buhari said will be funded by new domestic borrowing. It would be recalled that President Buhari also requested the House to approve the securitization of N23.7 trillion ways and means. However, the lawmakers are yet to approve the request, noting that the executive must submit more details to back the request. The lawmakers subsequently adjourned to February 28.
