Social commentator, Reno Omokri has said Nigeria does not need an ethnic champion like the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari. Omokri, in a post on his social media handles on Friday, said Buhari depended on “another regional overlord” like the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, to shore up his support in Southern Nigeria. Speaking on the presidential campaigns of APC’s Tinubu, Atiku Abubakar of PDP and Peter Obi of the Labour Party, he said, “Anytime Bola Tinubu holds a campaign rally in the Southwest, the stadium is always full to overflowing. But once he steps out of the Southwest, he has challenges filling stadia. Omokri alleged that Obi could not even fill stadia in his home region, saying it has been “on and off in the South East, and off everywhere else.” Omokri stated that the only candidate who has been consistent in his ability to fill up his campaign venue in all six geopolitical zones is Atiku. He further said, “Nigeria does not also need a candidate like Peter Obi, whose party is not even fielding candidates for hundreds of legislative seats in Northern Nigeria.” He added that the nation needs a leader who is accepted nationally, so he can make Nigeria relevant across the globe.
