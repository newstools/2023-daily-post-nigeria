Former Manchester United attacker, Louis Saha, has told Marcus Rashford the two things he must do to reach the level of both Paris Saint-Germain’s Lionel Messi and Al-Nassr’s Cristiano Ronaldo. Saha said Rashford just needs to have aggression and belief in order to reach both Ballon d’Or winners’ levels. According to him, the England international can score up to 40 goals a season for Man United. Speaking to Compare.bet, Saha said, “He [Rasford] is a player who can score 30-40 goals a season. There is no doubt about it. He can do it all, and why can’t Marcus Rashford do as much or even more than [Erling] Haaland or [Kylian] Mbappe? Those two guys have great pace and awareness that very few players have. “If he remains fit, remains confident, he is unstoppable. He can achieve everything. I have not seen a talent at United this good since Cristiano Ronaldo. He just needs that aggression and that belief that sets aside players like [Lionel] Messi and Cristiano from the rest.”
