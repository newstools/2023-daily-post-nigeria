Manchester United boss, Erik ten Hag, will be without two key players, Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw, when his side clashes with Reading in Saturday’s FA Cup fourth-round tie on Saturday night. Ten Hag spoke at his pre-match press conference ahead of Man United’s tie with Reading. Man United head to the game following a 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest in their last game in the EFL Cup. “Dalot is definitely out, and I think also Shaw [is] a question mark,” said Ten Hag. “We have to see after this training session, after this day, if he [Shaw] is available or not.” He added, “I think Aaron and Ty are playing magnificent at the moment. On Wednesday, they were really brilliant. The whole back four was brilliant on Wednesday.”
