He made the assertion on Thursday while fielding questions on Arise Television’s News programme. He said Atiku is the most well-received candidate among all the candidates contesting for the presidency. “The latest understanding that anybody who understands political analysis will go away with shows clearly that the world is ready to receive Atiku Abubakar as the president of Nigeria, and I want to advise Nigerians – this one does not even require advice, I can tell you clearly that across the six geo-political zones, as we speak today, the most well-received candidate in the array is Atiku Abubakar. “People believe that he has the understanding, people believe he has the knowledge, people believe that he has the experience, people believe that he has the wisdom to govern the country – post Buhari administration.
