The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu has unveiled his plans for the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, if elected president. Tinubu vowed to prevent the incessant ASUU strikes by ensuring stability in the country’s university system. Speaking at the APC presidential campaign rally in Damaturu, Yobe State, Tinubu pledged to provide loans for university students. The APC flag bearer said he would provide agro-credit facilities and make the Northeast region an export zone. He said: “I will extend the credit facilities to university students as loans. I will make our education system, especially the university education, more stable by dealing with the problem of ASUU strikes. There will be no more strikes in our universities.”
