Super Eagles defender, Zaidu Sanusi has been ruled out of Porto’s away trip to Casa Pia on Saturday. Sanusi recently returned to training at the club after spending over one month on the sidelines. The left-back sustained the injury during Porto’s UEFA Champions League clash against LaLiga club, Atletico Madrid in November. Providing an update on his team ahead of the game, Porto manager, Sergio Conceição said Sanusi is not fit to take part in the game. “Pepe, Zaidu and Evanilson will not be there against Casa Pia on Saturday,” Conceição told reporters. The 25-year-old has made nine league appearances for the Dragons this season.
