The Speaker, Osun State House of Assembly, Timothy Owoeye has described the death of Osun politician, Korede Idowu as a big blow to the progressive family in the State. Idowu before his demise was a former Osun State Commissioner for Environment and Sanitation in the second term of former Governor of Osun, Rauf Aregbesola. He was also a former Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ilesa East Local Government Area of the State. Owoeye, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Alabi to commiserate with the people of Ilesa, stated that the death of the politician would definitely leave a temporary vacuum for the APC in Ijesa South Federal Constituency. The Speaker stated that Idowu’s wise counsels will be sorely missed by the people of Ijesa South Federal constituency of the State as he regularly and willingly listened to leaders and always had good advice to move the progressive family forward in the axis. He also described late Idowu as a strong campaigner of progressive ideologies aimed at promoting a society that will make life meaningful for the masses. The Speaker also admonished supporters and people of Ijesa South to take solace in the admonition of the scriptures that held that God is sovereign over life and death. “God holds the power of life and death in each one of us. It is appointed unto man once to die but after this judgement. “The death of Korede Idowu is a big loss to Ilesa, Osun, as well as the entire progressive family. Idowu’s contributions to the growth of Ilesa and Osun will be missed. “Idowu’s death is sudden and shocking but with submission to the will of God which can not be questioned by we mortals. “I commiserate with the Idowu family, Ilesa East Local Government and Ijesa South Federal constituency at large. I pray that God Almighty will receive the soul of the departed leader and comfort his family,” the Speaker stated.
