The Labour Party, LP, has described its presidential campaign rally in Kaduna State as a huge success. This followed a mammoth crowd that received the party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi and his running mate, Senator Ahmed Datti, at the campaign venue on Wednesday. While sharing motion picture from the rally, the party claimed in a tweet on its official handle that unlike other political parties, those who trooped out for the rally were not induced with money.
