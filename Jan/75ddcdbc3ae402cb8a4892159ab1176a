The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has debunked report that its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar is sick. Report earlier emerged online purporting that the former vice president halted his campaign due to health issues. But clearing the air, the Spokesperson and Director Public Affairs of the party’s Presidential Campaign Management Committee, Senator Dino Melaye said Atiku is well and 100% fit. According to a terse statement he issued on Sunday, Dino said the PDP candidate was invited by the British Government, urging Nigerians to disregard contrary reports making the rounds. The statement reads, “Disregard the lies of unrepentant liars. Atiku is 100% fit and in super form healthwise. “The British Government invited the leading presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, just like they had invited Bola Tinubu and Peter Obi earlier. “Nigerians should henceforth disregard drug induced statements propelled by Ikebe super like online medium”.
