Remo Stars head coach, Daniel Ogunmodede has admitted his side committed too many mistakes in the 3-0 defeat to Bendel Insurance on Saturday. The Sky Blue Stars suffered their first defeat of the season in the Nigeria Premier Football League matchday four encounters at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, Benin City. The defeat saw Remo Stars drop to second position on the table and also lost their hundred percent record in the NPFL this season. Insurance was clearly the better in the game, a fact Ogunmodede attested to but believed things would have been different. ‘It’s not an extremely bad performance for me, they played well and played to instructions but that is football you can’t do without mistakes, “Ogunmodede told reporters after the game. “We conceded the three goals out of careless mistakes and Insurance was able to take advantage of it. “We conceded three cheap goals, and the unbeaten run ends but the league is a marathon and we are still second on the log, maybe Insurance deserved to be at the top for now because they won four games.”
