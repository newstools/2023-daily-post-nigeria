Famous singer turned politician, Olubankole Wellington, a.k.a Banky W has explained why the National Youth Service Corps, NYSC, should be optional in Nigeria. Banky W, who made this assertion on Tuesday during an interview on Channels Television, stated that the NYSC program hasn’t achieved everything it was designed for since its existence. “I don’t know if there is anybody that will disagree that NYSC probably does not achieve everything it was originally designed for today, so how do we reform it? Don’t cancel it, let’s remove it from the constitution and make it optional, the people who do not need it will go. “Now you can pay those interested more so instead of paying them N30,000 monthly which does nothing for a young person in Nigeria today. We can pay them N60 – N80, 000,” he said.
