Napoli manager, Luciano Spalletti was left in awe of Victor Osimhen’s quality after the Nigerian put up a masterful display in the club’s 5-1 demolition of title rivals, Juventus on Friday night. Osimhen proved his class as one of the best strikers in the game at the moment by scoring a brace and providing an assist in the Partenopei’s emphatic win at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium. The 24-year-old was at times unplayable in the game as the Juventus defence struggled to cope with his strong physicality, trickery and pace. Spalletti, who has formed a near perfect working relationship with Osimhen stated that his striker has the potential to become better in future. “Osimhen is such a great striker. I am stunned by the unexpressed potential he has and excited to see what he’ll do in future,” Spalletti told DAZN. The forward, who is the leading scorer in Serie A this season, has now scored 12 goals in 14 league appearances.
