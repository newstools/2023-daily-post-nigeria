Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta has identified striker, Eddie Nketiah, as a ‘great finisher.’ Arteta said this following Arsenal’s FA Cup third-round 3-0 win over Oxford United on Monday night. Recall that Arsenal defeated Oxford United at the Kassam Stadium following a goal from Mohamed Elneny and a brace from Eddie Nketiah. Speaking during his post-match press conference after the game, Arteta said he was happy with Nketiah. “He showed great composure. He is a great finisher and the timing of his runs as well,” Arteta said. “The decision making to wait until the last moment shows his quality. It is not only that – his understanding, his work rate, I think, is getting better and better. “And I am really happy with him.” Arsenal will now face Manchester City in the FA Cup fourth-round tie on January 28.
