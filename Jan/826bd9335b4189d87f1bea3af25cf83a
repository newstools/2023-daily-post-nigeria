The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Abia State, on Friday, announced a fresh governorship primary election following Prof. Uche Ikonne’s demise. Ikonne died on Wednesday after battling a protracted illness. The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, directed the party to conduct an election to replace the deceased. The directive relied upon the provisions of the New Electoral Act on the replacement of candidates arising from death. A statement on Friday by Abia PDP Vice Chairman, Elder Abraham Amah said a fresh primary would be conducted on Saturday February 4, 2023. The election will commence at 10 a.m. at the Umuahia Township Stadium, Umuahia, the capital. “All interested aspirants are requested to collect Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms from the PDP Headquarters at Wadata Plaza, Wuse Abuja. “The sale of both forms begins Friday January 27 and ends on Wednesday February 1. Screening of aspirants will hold at the PDP National Headquarters, Wadata Plaza l, Abuja, on Thursday February 2 at 11:00 am prompt”, Amah noted. Aspirants are expected to present themselves to the State Working Committee, SWC, of the Abia PDP on Friday February 2, 2023 at the State Secretariat. The statement added that further directives would be communicated when necessary. In mid-January, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu confirmed the late governorship candidate Uche Ikonne is ill, but “recovering gradually and progressively”. “I want to report some progress and the progress is that Ikonne is recovering gradually. He will be strong enough in the future to join,” said Ikpeazu, a PDP G5 member. Ikonne, a professor of optometry, served as the 7th Vice-Chancellor of the Abia State University (ABSU), Uturu.
