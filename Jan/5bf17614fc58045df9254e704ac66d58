Former Manchester United attacker, Edinson Cavani, was among the four players that were hit with bans by FIFA on Friday. Cavani and his Uruguay teammate, Diego Godin, was suspended for a game each after the duo confronted the referee following their 2022 FIFA World Cup match against the Black Stars of Ghana in Qatar. Also, Uruguay’s Fernando Muslera and Jose Maria Gimenez were hit with four-match bans by FIFA. FIFA launched proceedings against the four players who angrily harangued the referee after crashing out of the tournament in Qatar, in spite of beating Ghana 2-0 in their final group fixture on December 2. In the Group H deciders, Uruguay had one foot in the round of 16 before South Korea scored in stoppage time to beat Portugal 2-1 and qualified by virtue of scoring one goal more than the South Americans over their three matches. Germany referee, Daniel Siebert, opted not to award penalties for tackles on Liverpool’s Darwin Nunez in the first half and Cavani in the closing stage of the match, with former Barcelona star, Luis Suarez saying after the clash that FIFA was “against Uruguay”. The four players will also have to carry out football-related community service and will pay fines of up to 20,000 Swiss francs ($21,701). FIFA also ordered Uruguay to partially close their stadium for their next FIFA “A” international match as hosts.
