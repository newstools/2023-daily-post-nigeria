The Chairman of the Southern Kaduna Christian Leaders Association, Apostle Emmanuel Nuhu Kure, has enjoined people of the area to vote only those who are conversant with the environment and know how to solve the problems confronting it. During his charge at the 21st Southern Kaduna Prayer Summit held at the Kafanchan Township Stadium, he advised the people to ensure they do not vote along religious or ethnic considerations. He explained, “The people will not vote based on religious or ethnic sentiments, they will be more strategic in their choices in the forthcoming elections.” He said the Southern Kaduna region would not vote for any presidential, or governorship candidate who does not know the name or a sense of what they have suffered for more than 30 to 40 years. Apostle Kure lamented that the region had no new developmental centres, and no new cities but explained that the voting strength of the region was bigger than some states. The essence of the prayer summit, according to him was to unite the people and kingdoms for the restoration of the land, having spent three years without a formal gathering to pray due to COVID-19. He called on the people to unite themselves in praying for the restoration of the lost glory of the area and also pray for the success of the coming elections in the country.
