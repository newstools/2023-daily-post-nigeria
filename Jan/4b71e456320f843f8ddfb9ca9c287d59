Manchester City on Friday reacted to Chester Crown Court’s final decision on rape cases against their player, Benjamin Mendy. The court had earlier on Friday found Mendy not guilty of six counts of rape after jurors could not reach a majority verdict on the matter. Mendy’s trial had lasted for six-month at the court. During the aforementioned period, the jurors were unable to reach verdicts on one count of rape and one of attempted rape. Mendy was facing eight counts of rape, one count of attempted rape and one more count of sexual assault. However, the Crown Prosecution Service has promised to seek a retrial of the 28-year-old French star over the two rape charges the jury couldn’t decide on. Reacting, Man City, in a statement via its website, noted that the Premier League champions are not in the position to comment on the issue further following the court’s final decision. “Manchester City FC notes the verdict from Chester Crown Court today, where a jury has found Benjamin Mendy not guilty of seven charges. The jury is hung on two charges, and the trial is now over,” Man City’s statement reads. “Given there are open matters related to this case, the Club is not in a position to comment further at this time.
