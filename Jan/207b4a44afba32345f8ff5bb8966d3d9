The Director of Youths Affairs, Labour Party Presidential Campaign Council, Isah Abubakar, has called on Nigerian youths to re-energize their commitment to a better Nigeria by channelling their frustrations to electing credible candidates to take over the affairs of the country in 2023. Commenting on the appointment of States and Zonal Coordinators, Abubakar explained that they were chosen to successfully execute the mission of ushering the party into power in the next dispensation. He added, “This appointment is to further consolidate the momentum and goodwill that the OBI-DATTI campaign has been massively enjoying from the Nigerian People so far.” Isah thanked the courage, tenacity, and commitment of Nigerian youths to the mission of salvaging what is left of the country and urged all members to remain focused and avoid any political rivalry with any party that would affect their good intention for 2023. “It is worthy of note that the youths have been the engine that has driven the OBI-DATTI train to this point. Therefore, it is expedient for us to do more because, in this mission of saving our Nation, we cannot afford to be weary or tired, especially at this critical time of our struggle,” he assured. The statement explained that all state coordinators should with immediate effect, constitute local government coordinators, down to ward representatives.
