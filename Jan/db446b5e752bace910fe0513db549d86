Former Chelsea player and manager Ruud Gullit has told Moroccan winger Hakim Ziyech to join Barcelona. Gullit believes the World Cup star would be the perfect signing for Barcelona. The 29-year-old Morocco international has found it difficult to cement his place in the Blues’ lineup since his £34 million move from Ajax in 2020. He has, however, won a total of three trophies with the Blues including the Champions League and Club World Cup. He has started just five matches across all competitions for the Blues under Graham Potter this season. By the time the Blues fully introduces their new signings such as Joao Felix and Mykhailo Mudryk, Morocco would fall further down the pecking order. Speaking to Ziggo Sport, Gullit feels the winger should leave for Barcelona. “The way Ziyech plays for Morocco, I’ve never seen him play for Chelsea. “I wonder… I think he comes into his own in Spain. I have the impression that he has never reached the level of Ajax in England. I would really like to see him in Spain in the future. He can reach his top level there. He would also fit well in that Barcelona team.”
