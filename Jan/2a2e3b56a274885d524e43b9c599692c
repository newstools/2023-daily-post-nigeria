A fire disaster on Tuesday destroyed four rooms and a mosque in the Igboro area of the Ilorin metropolis, Kwara State. The incident occurred at about 18:37hrs at Ile-Olowo Compound opposite the Childrenâ€™s Specialist Hospital in Ilorin South Local Government Area, said the spokesman of the state fire service, Hassan Adekunle, in a statement in Ilorin on Wednesday. Firemen were able to control the further spread of the ravaging fire from the surrounding buildings and subsequently extinguished it. The officers also added that thorough damping of the surrounding areas has been done to avoid a resurgence of the blazing inferno. A report said the fire was caused by an electric power surge. The Director, Kwara State Fire Service, Prince Falade John Olumuyiwa, urged the general public to be more vigilant and procure necessary safety gears at home. He advised residents to be extra careful as most materials have dried up as a result of the season and are ready to catch fire at any time.
