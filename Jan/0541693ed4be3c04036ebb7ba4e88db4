The chairman of All Progressives Congress, APC, in Lau Local Government Council of Taraba State, Mallam Musa Umar, has been suspended. His suspension is coming barely two days before the Supreme Court judgement on the party’s governorship tussle. The suspension letter, a copy of which was made available to journalists in Jalingo, the state capital, indicted the embattled chairman of anti-party activities. Addressing journalists, the party’s vice chairman in the council, Musa Eli Bamga, alleged that “the chairman has been working against the party since 2021.” He stressed that the executives of the party in the council did not hesitate to suspend Umar from office for anti-party and other related offences and therefore will mete out the same treatment to any member of the party caught in sharp practices. Bamga further claimed that the suspended chairman has been directed to hand over all the party’s properties in his possession to the vice chairman. Though the beleaguered chairman could not be reached for comment, a close associate of his claimed that his removal was done wrongly. The associate who spoke anonymously said the suspended chairman “will not take the suspension lightly and will explore legitimate means to exonerate himself from the allegations levelled against him.”
