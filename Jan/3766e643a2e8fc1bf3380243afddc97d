The humour side of President Muhammadu Buhari played out at the Presidential Villa, Abuja on Wednesday, as he threw funny banters at Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, which sent the latter reeling uncontrollably with laughter. Bishop Kukah is renowned for being a critic of the Buhari administration, despite initial support which ensured the success of the All Progressive Congress at clinching power in 2015. The clergy who presides over the affairs of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto had been critical of the leadership style of Buhari, especially on issues of security. Before both men had the opportunity to share a mirthful moment, President Buhari had said Nigeriaâ€™s ability to attract loans for development was only possible because creditors had confidence in its ability to pay back. Kukah was among the delegation that accompanied the Executive members of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria, CBCN, to pay a courtesy call on the President on Wednesday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.
