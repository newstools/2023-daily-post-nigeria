The Federal Government on Thursday confirmed its plan to make Ekiti a major Free Trade Zone, FTZ, in Nigeria.

Adesugba said the establishment would support the state in delivering economic and knowledge free zone for education-based industries and technological companies. He noted that the economic zone would boost the economy of Ekiti, increase its Internally Generated Revenue and reduce over-reliance on federal allocation. The MD said the FTZ would be ready within 18 months, expressing the commitment of the Federal Government toward the successful completion of the project. Adesugba said Ekiti is known for education, ideas innovation, and “we are going to show the world that Nigeria has arrived”. “Government is committed to making Ekiti home of block chain technology, where technological companies and other industries that have things to do with education will be ready to invest.” The NEPZA chief hinted that the first thing was to get a presidential declaration to make Ekiti a free zone.
