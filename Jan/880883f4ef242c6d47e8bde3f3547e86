Winner of the Primary Election of the Peoples Democratic Party for the Ado/Ogbadibo/Okpokwu Federal Constituency of Benue State, Barr. Aida Nath Ogwuche is set to proceed into the general election as candidate of the party despite the judgement of the court of Appeal sitting in Abuja invalidating her nomination on the 12th of January, 2023. Accompanying the notice of appeal, our correspondent sighted a motion seeking a stay of Execution of the earlier Judgment pending the hearing and determination of the appeal at the supreme court. In the said motion, the PDP and the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC were restrained from honouring the judgment in favour of Mr. Francis Ottah. Following the development, the supreme court is expected to assume full Jurisdiction and parties in the appeal may have to maintain status quo, pending the outcome of the appeal in Supreme Court. Considering the limited time before the March elections, Aida Nath Ogwuche has concluded plans to go into the election as Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party.
