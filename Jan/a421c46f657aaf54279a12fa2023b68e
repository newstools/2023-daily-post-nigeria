The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has said those involved in double and multiple registrations will not be given Permanent Voter Cards, PVCs, even as the commission extended the collection deadline to February 5, 2023. INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, in a statement issued Saturday, said the one-week extension would be the final extension for PVCs collection. The collection of PVCs was slated to end on Sunday, 29th January 2023, before the electoral umpire extended it by a week. DAILY POST reports that the commission had on Friday held a meeting with the Resident Electoral Commissioners, RECs, from the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja and deliberated on the ongoing collection of PVCs in its 774 local government offices nationwide. At the meeting, the Chairman of the Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, indicated that the Commission would not hesitate to consider additional measures to ensure that all citizens have ample opportunity to collect their PVCs ahead of the general election. It said: “Arising from reports from the various States and discussions with Resident Electoral Commissioners, the Commission has decided to further extend PVC collection in all its Local Government Offices nationwide by an additional one week. “The ongoing collection of PVCs nationwide will therefore continue and end on 5th February 2023. “Those that engaged in double and multiple registration should not bother visiting any of the Commission’s Offices as the Commission did not print their PVCs.” It added that the collection period has been extended by an additional two hours and would start at 9 am and end at 5 pm daily, including Saturdays and Sundays. It assured that all those that carried out valid registration will collect their PVCs.
