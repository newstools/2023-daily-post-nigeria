Oluremi, the wife of the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, has urged Nigerians to ‘drive out’ her husband if he fails to perform if elected president. She gave the charge at the South-East women’s rally for Tinubu/Shettima Presidential Campaign in Owerri, Imo State. The former Lagos State governor said February’s election should be centred around performance with the fear of God and not religion. He urged Nigerians to give the APC Muslim-Muslim a chance after voting for Christian-Christian. “Let’s leave religion aside; I am a Christian. Have you ever thought that one day a Christian-Christian candidate would emerge? What would be the reference point? “We have tried the Muslim-Christian ticket; let us try this one too, and after four years, if they don’t do well, you can drive them out,” she said.
