At least, 11 passengers were burnt to death beyond recognition in a fatal crash that happened on Sunday in Ondo State. The victims were said to be heading to Lagos in a luxury Marcopolo bus when they met their death on the busy Benin-Lagos highway. The fatal accident occurred at Soka Bridge in Ore, headquarters of Odigbo Local Government Area. According to sources, a truck which was on a one-way had a head-on collision with the Marcopolo bus. One of the sources who craved anonymity stated that the bus went up in flames immediately after the accident occurred. While confirming the accident, the Ondo Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps, FRSC, Mr Ezekiel Son’Allah, said the accident occurred as a result of overspeeding on the part of the drivers of the vehicles involved. Son’Allah added that the corps contacted the Step Down Company Fire Service and Nigeria Police for emergency services support. He further maintained that the accident caused traffic congestion on the Benin-Lagos route which was attended to by his men. “The fire has been extinguished, while the traffic is being controlled on the Benin-Lagos Lane. Efforts are in top gear with other security agencies to remove the crashed vehicles from the road,” he affirmed.
