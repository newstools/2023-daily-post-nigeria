The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) said it has sealed a total of 13 filling stations in Akwa Ibom State for selling fuel above the government-approved pump price of N300 per litre. Most filling stations in Akwa Ibom State sell fuel between N305-N320. The Team Lead, Distribution Systems Storage and Retailing Infrastructure of NMDPRA, Mr Joy Koro disclosed this on Friday during a monitoring and surveillance exercise in Uyo. Koro warned marketers to stop selling above the government-approved price or face the consequences of shutting down their stations. According to him, “we sealed off 13 filling stations for dispensing far above the government-approved pump price of N300 per litre. “Marketers know the government-approved pump price, if we carry out surveillance and we see them selling at a regulated price, we will not seal the filling station. “I, therefore, warn marketers to stop selling the products above government approved price and revert to the approved price in the state.” Koro said there are enough petroleum products in the state for marketers to lift to their stations and urged them not to create artificial scarcity.
