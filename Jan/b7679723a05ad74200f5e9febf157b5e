Former Leeds United boss, Marcelo Bielsa is set to replace Frank Lampard as Everton’s new coach. As reported by Sky Sports, Bielsa is under consideration as Lampard’s replacement with Everton 19th in the Premier League. The Everton hierarchy have made Bielsa their first choice to become the club’s next manager after sacking Lampard on Monday. Bielsa, who has been out of work since he left Leeds last February, has already held talks with Everton’s chiefs about taking over at Goodison Park. The report added that the 67-year-old has also indicated his willingness to take on the job. Recall that Everton sacked Lampard on Monday after Saturday’s 2-0 defeat against West Ham United, leaving them 19th in the Premier League and without a win in 10 matches in all competitions. Everton’s next game is not until February 4, when Arsenal visit Goodison Park.
