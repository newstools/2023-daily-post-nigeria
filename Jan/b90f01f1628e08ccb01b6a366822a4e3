Igbos living in Finland have disowned the self-acclaimed disciple of the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu. The development followed incessant killings in the region occasioned by compulsory sit-at-home enforced by Simon Ekpa as a protest against the Federal Government. Recently, Ekpa a Finland-based Nigerian was in the news for enforcing a five-day sit-at-home in the entire region leading to the killing of unsuspecting citizens and the destruction of government and privately owned properties. The Igbo community in Finland stated in a statement by Kingsley Orji that Ekpa was recently summoned and interrogated over the security reality in Southeast. They blamed him for the security crisis in the region which has persisted since the IPOB leader was rearrested in 2021 and detained by the Department of State Security Services. The statement reads in part, “While we respect and recognise the right of individuals to express their thoughts, the Igbo Community in Finland strongly denounces Mr. Simon Ekpa’s seditious statements and actions, which have taken on a dangerously violent dimension of killing and devastation whenever he issues such directives. “Due to his threats and the violent actions of his group in Southeast Nigeria, there is a high level of insecurity in Igboterritory, which makes it hard to travel and do business. “Simon Ekpa is warned strongly not to use social media to spread threats of violence, which is making the Igbo people of Nigeria angry”.
