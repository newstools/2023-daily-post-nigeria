The National Director of Publicity and Advocacy of the Northern Elders Forum, NEF, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed has said that Peter Obi’s presidency “could end the Biafran cause.” Baba-Ahmed said Obi’s “most formidable foe” is “the violence in the East.” In his weekly article, Baba-Ahmed noted that it would be difficult for Obi to emerge victorious in February due to the battling “titans,” Tinubu and Atiku. Baba-Ahmed said the Labour Party, LP, would have made more impact if it distanced itself from the titans. The NEF spokesman lamented that Obi’s supporters believe in miracles than negotiating for votes. According to Baba-Ahmed: “Peter Obi’s Labour Party would have made a greater impact if he had earlier charted a different course as a different politician and created greater distance from the titans that he is fighting today. “His primary constituency is wrought with multiple cross-cutting political interests, and he is unable to resolve a primary contradiction. “His presidency could end the Biafran cause, wiping out a lot of the beneficiaries of an idea whose essence can be found in every inch of Nigeria.” DAILY POST had reported that Obi’s supporters might de-market and frustrate his presidential ambition in the Southeast.
