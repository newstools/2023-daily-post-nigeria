The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has denied releasing a list of candidates for the 2023 general elections. Festus Okoye, the spokesman of INEC, said Nigerians should discountenance reports that the Commission released a final list of candidates cleared for the 2023 general election. Okoye said INEC could not publish the final list with just 46 days to the commencement of the 2023 general elections. A statement by Okoye reads partly: “The Commission wishes to state categorically that no new publication of the final list of candidates was released as reported. The public should therefore discountenance the story. “There can not be a final list of candidates with just 46 days to the general election except for names published as a substitution for candidates nominated earlier in compliance with court order. “Moreover, some of the candidates that made the “new” final list are still in court, and the matter is therefore subjudiced. “Political parties, litigants, and the public should be guided accordingly.”
