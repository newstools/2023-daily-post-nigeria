A lawmaker in the State of Texas House of Representatives, Jarvis Johnson has lamented that Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, might die in solitary confinement. To this end, Johnson urged the Nigerian Government to release Kanu due to his deteriorating health. Johnson said the Nigerian Government was committing genocide against the Igbo people by refusing to release Kanu. He made the call in a statement he signed and forwarded to DAILY POST by Kanu’s Special Counsel, Aloy Ejimakor. He recounted how the Nigerian Government allegedly abducted Kanu in Kenya and refused to release him despite court orders and calls by the United Nations Working Group. The statement reads partly: “Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, is the foremost Freedom Fighter for the rights of oppressed people in Nigeria. “The Nigerian Government has refused to obey the orders of its own courts, and Kanu remains in solitary confinement enforced by its Secret Police. “Kanu’s health conditions have been ignored by Nigeria’s Secret Police. He has been denied access to his doctors and to the regular supply of his medications. “His health has increasingly deteriorated, and it is now feared that he may die in solitary confinement.” Johnson pointed out that Kanu’s only offence was his agitation for Biafra. He urged the US government to prevail on its Nigerian counterpart to stop the genocide against Kanu. “I am demanding the immediate release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. The Government of Nigeria needs to comply with the UN Mandate and the Orders of its own Courts. The Nigerian Government is carrying out another form of genocide, one citizen at a time,” he added.
