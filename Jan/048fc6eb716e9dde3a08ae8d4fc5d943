Minister of Police Affairs, Mohammed Dingyadi said the appointment of Usman Baba as the Inspector-General of Police is for a single tenure of four years. Dingyadi made the confirmation on Thursday through his Press Secretary, Osaigbovo Ehisienmen. The minister explained that the clarification followed reports of tenure extension in a section of the media. Dingyadi said the IGP was appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari on April 6, 2021 and confirmed by the Nigeria Police Council on June, 2021 for a single tenure. Osaigbovo Ehisienmen said the appointment was done as provided for in Section 7 (3), and Section 7 (6) of the Police Act 2020. “These provisions of the 2020 amended Police Acts should not be misconstrued for tenure extension as erroneously reported in some sections of the media,” he said. The minister advised the public to ignore unfounded allegations.
