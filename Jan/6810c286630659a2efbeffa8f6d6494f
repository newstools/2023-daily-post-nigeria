Fifteen persons have been confirmed dead and five others seriously injured in an auto crash that occurred in Kogi State. The crash occurred at Koton-Karfe along Lokoja-Abuja highway around 7.30am on Tuesday. Stephen Dawulung, Kogi Federal Road Safety Corps, FRSC, Sector Commander, while confirming the incident to newsmen, said the collision was between a J-5 Boxer Bus and a Petroleum Tanker. He said that the 5 injured persons were rushed to Ideal Hospital at Koton-Karfe while corpses of the dead victims were deposited at the Morgue of the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Lokoja. Dawulung explained the bus driver violated traffic rules by driving against traffic while heading to Abuja from Lokoja. “The bus driver left his lane and was driving in the opposite direction on high speed only to have a head on collision with an on coming petroleum tanker. “The unfortunate thing is that the bus was conveying iron cramps with 17 passengers, 15 of which were terribly squeezed and chocked to death during the collision,” he said.
