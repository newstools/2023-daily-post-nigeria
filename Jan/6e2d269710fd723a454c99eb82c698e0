Deji Adeyanju, a socio-political activist has linked the attack on the Coalition of United Political Parties, CUPP, spokesperson, Ikenga Ugochinyere, to the Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma. Adeyanju explained that Uzodinma’s associates had severally threatened Ikenga’s life. In a statement he signed, Adeyanju said those that attacked Ikenga should not be alive. The Abuja-based lawyer charged security operatives to apprehend the perpetrators of the attack and ensure they are dealt with. According to Adeyanju: “I condemn the inhumane attack targeted at Mr Ikenga Ugochinyere in Akokwa, Imo State today, leading to loss of lives of his family members and the destruction of his properties. The perpetrators of this atrocious act are no doubt barbarians. “My suspicion is that Governor Hope Uzodinma is behind this attack as Ikenga had alerted the public to numerous threats to his life by associates of the Imo State governor.” Describing the attack as a “blatant mockery of law and order,” the Abuja-based activist noted that “it is also a convenient indication that our police are indeed letting evil, bloodthirsty politicians thrive.” Lamenting the inability of security agents to probe the attack, Adeyanju said: “The unreactive attitude of the Nigerian Police Force to protect and investigate the initial death threat on Mr Ikenga has to be the height of dereliction of duty in the history of policing. “The evil perpetrators should be fished out and punished with the full extent of the law.”
