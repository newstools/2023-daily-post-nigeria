Following the January 31 deadline issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, some Churches in Warri and its environs in Delta State during their Sunday services rejected offerings from their members, saying they will no longer accept the old naira notes still in circulation. Most churches were not filled to capacity due to the hike in petrol price. Members who do not have the new naira notes couldnâ€™t give offerings either. The rejection of the old naira notes may affect the account of the churches negatively. This is coming as most churches announced to their members not to bring the old naira notes to church last Sunday in Warri. Traders have already rejected the same old naira notes. This has reduced sales for them. At the time of filing this report, some crowds besieged some of the banks in Effurun, Uvwie Local Government Area as early as 6am. The crowds struggled to deposit their old naira notes into their accounts. Some of the banks that were overtaken by crowds includes, Union Bank, First Bank, United Bank for Africa, UBA, Zenith Bank, Sterling Bank and First City Monument Bank, FCMB. Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Nigeria has extended the deadline to February 10 to enable Nigerians swap their old naira notes.
