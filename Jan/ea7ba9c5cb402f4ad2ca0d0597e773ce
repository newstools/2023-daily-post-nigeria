Big Brother Titans housemate, Lukay has described his fellow South African housemate, Nelisa as a liar. During his diary session on Wednesday, the housemate who was asked to talk about some of his fellow housemates told Big Brother that “Nelisa tells a lot of lies. She’s always making things up. She literally has a story about everything. “I can tell you now that I was almost in a plane crash and she’ll come in and say ‘yes even me I was in a plane the other day and the flight attendant was doing this and that and it starting swinging to the left and to the right’ then you can see her trying to make up the story in her head and she’ll start adding it up and putting it together. “She does exactly the same thing with Thaban. They have opinions about every single thing. “And every single thing you talk about she must have something. She’s never out and can never say I don’t know about this or I’m not part of it. “She always has something that she has done that you have done too. There’s no person like that in this world, Big Brother. She has opinions about everything …and she’s still young but she feels that she’s done everything in the world. “She always has something to say about everything everybody says. No human being can relate to everything in life.”
