The lawmaker communicated his resolve to dump the ruling party in a letter he addressed to the APC Chairman of Batagarawa Ward ‘A’ on Friday. According to Dalhat in the letter, the decision to resign his membership of the APC was with immediate effect. However, he did not state any reason for his exit. The lawmaker, in the letter, thanked members of the party that made his stay in the APC remarkable. Dalhat also seized the opportunity to thank all his supporters and the entire people of Batagarawa/Rimi/Charanchi Federal Constituency for the opportunity they gave him to contribute his quota to the development of the country.
