Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand has stated that Victor Osimhen is too expensive for the club. The Red Devils, who are looking to bring in a new striker following Cristiano Ronaldo’s departure, have continued to be linked with Osimhen. United reportedly enquired about Osimhen last summer but were put off by Napoli’s exorbitant price tag. Ferdinand though recognized Osimhen’s talents, advised his former club to go for Porto’s Mehdi Taremi. “I would have gone and got Taremi in from Porto,” the United legend said when the club’s search for a striker was raised on his YouTube show Vibe with Five. “It’s massive money, 100 million, 120 million, [Victor] Osimhen, you’re getting charged. You’re paying big dough for these guys.”
