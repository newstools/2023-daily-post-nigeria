Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has reacted to the resignation of a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Board of Trustees, BoT, Prof. A.B.C. Nwosu from the party. Wike said PDP would face the repercussions of Nwosu’s resignation from the party. According to him, Nwosu’s resignation validates what he and other G-5 governors have been fighting for. Speaking in Port Harcourt, Rivers State on Saturday, Wike said G-5 governors want equality for everybody because nobody should be treated as a second-class citizen. He said: “Recently, Prof. A.B.C Nwosu resigned from the party saying that his conscience will not allow him, that the constitution of the party is clear. “What the people are saying is look, you have taken this, let these people take that and you are saying you will take all. If you take it all, you will also face the repercussions.” Nwosu had announced his resignation in a letter addressed to the party’s National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu.
