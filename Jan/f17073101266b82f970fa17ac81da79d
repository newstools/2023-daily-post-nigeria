Popular Nigerian actor and activist Yomi Fabiyi has flaunted his new lover months after a messy split from baby mama Grace Jimoh. Showing off his new lover on Tuesday in a viral video on social media, the actor took to his Instagram page to recount how his ex almost ruined his life with ‘lies’. He wrote, “If not for God, terrible lies and defamations would have ended my career. That is not what you use womanhood to do. “Age is not an excuse for being extremely devilish and wicked. This person has dated men far older than I am. “If I was not smart enough, at the height of my storm was back-to-back lies, evil and plots to bring me down from her. Only if I did her wrong, but there’s no way you can explain that some loose lives won’t want to pick holes. They just want you down. Agents of darkness. “I never raised my hands on any of my partners, not even on this girl, but it was all over the media that I beat her to a stupor and to the point of forced labour. How evil can that be, to beat a nine months pregnant lady,” he wrote. However, he didn’t give details of his newfound love interest. Recall that Yomi Fabiyi was first married to his estranged British wife, Fran, in 2012, but the marriage crashed ten years later without a child. In February 2022, he welcomed a baby boy with Grace but separated months later.
