Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale has been named the best goalkeeper in the world at the moment. According to him, Liverpool shot-stopper Alisson Becker is the most complete goalkeeper in the world. The Brazilian has been an ever-present for the Reds since joining the Premier League giants from AS Roma for €62.5 million in 2018. Ramsdale, who himself has been outstanding for Arsenal this season, was asked which goalkeeper he sees as the most complete in world football, and the England international said, “The most complete goalkeeper is Alisson, he’s the one you look to. “His major strength is how calm he is, his mentality. He’s definitely one that nothing fazes him. So composed.” Alisson has made 210 appearances at Anfield, keeping 94 clean sheets.
