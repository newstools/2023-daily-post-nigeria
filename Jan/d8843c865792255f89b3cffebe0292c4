A former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Timi Frank, has described the majority judgement of the Osun State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal that purportedly sacked Governor Ademola Adeleke as highly compromised. Frank in a statement issued Friday in reaction to the judgement said the verdict fell short of expectations and does not reflect the will of the majority of the people of Osun who freely elected Adeleke as Governor. Against this background, he called on the National Judicial Council to urgently probe the verdict and also penalize any of the tribunal members found to have compromised on integrity. Frank also called on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to urgently investigate the judges who wrote the majority judgement and prosecute those found to have based their decision on other considerations rather than the true facts canvassed during the hearing of the case. He vowed that Nigerians will not fold their arms and watch any attempt to use the judiciary to again steal Adelekeâ€™s mandate through the backdoor. Frank, however, urged the people of Osun to remain calm and law-abiding with the certainty that the mandate given to Adeleke would be retrieved at the appellate court.
