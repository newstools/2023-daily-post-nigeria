With less than 40 days to the presidential election, the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu has warned Nigerians against voting for his Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, counterpart, Atiku Abubakar, stressing that the latter wants Nigerians to “go hungry.” Tinubu warned that Atiku would sell Nigerians to his shady friends under the guise of privatization if elected president. Speaking at his presidential campaign in Ilorin, Kwara State yesterday, Tinubu said voting for Atiku would be an error that would be difficult to correct. Tinubu claimed that facts have shown that Atiku was only interested in becoming Nigeria’s president to enrich himself and his allies. “The PDP candidate in the race is well known for selling everything that has the Federal Republic of Nigeria’s name on it. If it is part of the public treasure or national patrimony, he is looking to pawn it to one of his shady partners. “He wants to sell off your chance at a decent job, good schools, a nice home and a happy life. His aim is to sell and turn our public assets into his private profit. He wants you to go hungry so that he can feast off the abundance of the land.”
