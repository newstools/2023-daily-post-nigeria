Chelsea have finally made a breakthrough in their pursuit of Benfica’s Enzo Fernandez, the Times reports. The Blues are now expected to smash the British transfer record on the Argentina World Cup winner. Chelsea were strongly linked with a move for Fernandez at the start of the transfer window, but talks broke down as Benfica insisted he was not for sale. Despite Benfica’s stance, Chelsea revived their interest in the 22-year-old over the weekend, with the west London club co-owner Todd Boehly personally involved in talks. Chelsea indicated they were ready to spend more than £100million to bring the midfielder to Stamford Bridge before the January transfer window shuts on Tuesday night. Graham Potter’s side are keen to increase their offer to around £115m – a British transfer record as the sum of money appears to have forced Benfica’s hand.
