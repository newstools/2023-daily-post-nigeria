A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu has said his party’s candidate, Bola Tinubu will win the next general election, while the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar will come a distant second. Kalu, who is also the Chief Whip of the Senate, stated this while fielding questions on the Channels Television’s Political Paradigm programme aired on Tuesday. “Let me give you what I think will come: Tinubu will come distant first and Atiku will come distant second and others will follow,” he said. Senator Kalu also said the South-East zone does not have the numerical strength to win a presidential election without forming a strong alliance with other regions, especially the North. “I can only run if all 18 political parties zone their presidential candidates to South-East because we don’t have the numbers to follow it up,” he said. While also dismissing the alleged endorsement of Obi as his preferred candidate for the forthcoming presidential election, he added that Obi hails from the zone that doesn’t have the required support from the other zones because of the issues of secessionist agitation.
