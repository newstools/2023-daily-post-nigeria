The federal government has said its proposed 1,374-kilometre road projects will generate close to N11.54 trillion for the Nation’s treasury. On Thursday, the Acting Head of Media and Publicity, Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission ICRC, Manji Yarling, disclosed this in Abuja. The commission explained that the projects would utilise the Public Private Partnership (PPP) Model in its 25 years concession period. He listed the routes to include 125 kilometres Benin-Asaba road, which has been granted a concession for 25 years and is expected to generate N1.58 trillion with the concessionaire, Africa Plus Consortium. Others are the 195km Abuja-Lokoja road which also has a 25-year concession period and is expected to generate N1.76 trillion with Avia Infrastructure Services Ltd (AISL) as a concessionaire. According to him, the 161.2km Onitsha-Owerri-Aba route would generate N706 billion with Enyimba Economic City Consortium as a concessionaire, among others. Yarling said that the projects aimed to ensure the management and development of the country’s Federal Road Network achieve adequate highway services. “It is also to maximise the revenue-generating opportunity of the routes and achieve equity in road charges,” he said.
