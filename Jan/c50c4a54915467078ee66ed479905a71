A Delta State Magistrate Court sitting in Ibusa, Oshimili North Local Government Area, has remanded a man at Ogwashi-Uku Correctional Centre for allegedly raping his girlfriend’s 17-year-old daughter. An activist handling the case, Marvin Mordi, alleged that the suspect had been molesting the victim since she was 11 years old and infected her with HIV virus. ”The teenager’s mother was aware of the situation but chose to cover it up because she didn’t want to lose her relationship. Confirming the incident, popular activist, Comrade Israel Joe, in a post accompanied by the man’s picture on his Instagram page, disclosed that the man infected the victim’s mother with HIV. “Today, a magistrate court in Ibusa remanded this man who infected a woman with HIV and also has been defiling her teen daughter. I saw this man at State CID Asaba on Thursday and thanked God he was not released; hence the jungle justice would have taken place,” he wrote.
