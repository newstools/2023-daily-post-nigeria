The Speaker of the House of Representatives has threatened to order the arrest of Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele to appear before the committee investigating the old naira notes withdrawal. Gbajabiamila said this on Thursday after the Majority Leader of the House, Ado Doguwa informed him that Emefiele and others shunned the invitation to a meeting on Wednesday. Responding to the statement, Gbajabiamila said he will not hesitate to order the Inspector General of Police, Akali Baba to issue an arrest warrant to compel Emefiele to appear before the committee. Mr Gbajabiamila added that the House ought to adjourn today to prepare for the elections, however, they will stay back to resolve the currency swap crisis. “I will, pursuant to the authority conferred by Section 89 (1)(d) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Order 19 (2)(1) of the Standing Orders of the House of Representatives, not hesitate to issue a warrant to the Inspector General of the Nigeria Police Force to compel the attendance of the CBN or Managing Directors who fail, refuse or neglect to respond to the summons by the House of Representatives,” he said. He also stated that Emefiele’s deadline is not consistent with sector 20 of the CBN Act, noting that the banks are compelled to accept the old notes even after the expiration of the deadline. It would be recalled that the Presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Tinubu, who is believed to be The Godfather of Gbajabiamila, also spoke against the policy on Thursday during a rally. Tinubu alleged that the policy is targeted at his presidential ambition.
