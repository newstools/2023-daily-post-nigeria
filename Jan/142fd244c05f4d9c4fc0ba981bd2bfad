Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State on Tuesday inaugurated six new judges. The governor, during the swearing-in of the judges at the Government House in Yola, charged them to protect the judiciary as the last hope of all and safeguard the country’s democracy. “All my life, I have never felt so fearful like the day I stood and held the Holy Quran alone and swore to work for Adamawa State. My wife, my children and my entire family were all there and none supported me in holding the Qur’an. “It simply reminds me at all times that the burden is mine alone and God will ask only me [of] this responsibility. This reminder has remained my guiding compass throughout all my public dealings. My humble counsel is, never forget the dictates of your oath in all your dealings,” the governor told the judges. Responding on behalf of himself and his fellow new judges, Justice Muhammed Ibrahim Tola said Governor Fintiri is a pillar to the judiciary to whom they are indebted to do what is right all the time. Those sworn in as high court judges with Muhammed Tola were Ahmad Isa, Christopher Dominic Mapeo and Benjamin Manji. Yusuf Khalid was sworn in as a Grand Khadi while Abdabala Nicholas was sworn in as a customary judge. The oath of office was administered to the new judges by the acting Chief Judge of Adamawa State, Justice Hapsat Abdulrahman.
