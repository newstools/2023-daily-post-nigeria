Famous Nigerian Afrobeats musician, David Adeleke, professionally known by his stage name Davido, has updated his marital status on Wikipedia. Davido reportedly finalised his traditional marriage rites to Chioma on Thursday. DAILY POST reports that the singer’s Wikipedia page now reflects his new marital status and his wife’s name. The singer finally paid Chioma’s bride price (Umunna) in full at Ezeala Odu, Imo State, on Thursday, January 5. Also confirming their marriage in a trending video on social media, Chioma’s father could be seen performing the Umunna and Umuada rites on Thursday. It was earlier reported in November last year that the singer secretly got married to Chioma a month after the death of their only son, Ifeanyi Adeleke. According to the report, the traditional wedding, which was done in her father’s house, had few family friends in attendance with no cameras allowed. And because of the tragedy surrounding their marriage last year, Davido could not perform his Umunna rites. As such, according to the Igbo culture, he and Chioma weren’t fully married. Recall that Davido had, last year before the tragic incident, vowed to marry Chioma in 2023, but after their son’s death, the singer speedily wedded her.
