Former Crystal Palace chairman Simon Jordan has questioned Arsenal’s capability to win the Premier League this season. Jordan does not think the Gunners have what it takes to go all the way to beat Manchester City to the title. Arsenal extended their lead in the lead table to eight points after beating Tottenham 2-0 on Sunday and Manchester City losing 2-1 to Manchester United. Mikel Arteta’s side are hoping to claim the title this season having waited since 2004 when they last won the Premier League. Jordan disagrees that the North London side are now favourites to win the Premier League because he reckons City will get back into form. “I think Arsenal are in a unique vein of form at this moment of time. I think it’s wrong to compare what happened in May with Tottenham where Arsenal were on a wobble while Tottenham came through that. “Arsenal are improving exponentially. I still think there’s a question as to whether Arsenal can win the league,” he stated.
