The Police in Kano State have arrested a popular comedy TikTok skit maker, Murja Ibrahim Kunya, for allegedly corrupting the morals of the society. The police, according to Daily Nigerian, arrested Miss Murja while trying to book hotel rooms for her guests who came from far and near for her much-publicized birthday jamboree. DAILY POST gathered that in September last year, a Sharia court had written to the Kano State Commissioner of Police to arrest and investigate Miss Murja Ibrahim Kunya, alongside other 9 Tik Tokers for corrupting the morals of the society. The letter read in part, “Sequel to the complaint lodged by Muhd Ali Hamza Esq, Abba Mahmud, Esq, Sunusi I. Umar Esq, Abba, A.T Bebeji Esq, B.I Usman Esq, Muhd Nasir Esq, L.T Dayi Esq, G.A Badawi & Badamasi Suleiman Gandu Esq, I am directed by the presiding Upper Sharia Court Judge, Bichi Division Kano to write and kindly request you to conduct investigation against the above mentioned suspects for proper action”. The 9 other Tik Tokers included in the letter are: Mr 442, Safara’u, Dan Maraya, Amude Booth, Kawu Dan Sarki, Ado Gwanja, Ummi Shakira, Samha Inuwa and Babiana. Recall that two young men: Mubarak Isa and Nazifi Bala were last year sentenced by a senior magistrate court to 20 strokes of cane, as well as 30 days community service after finding them guilty of defaming the character of Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje and fanning the embers of discord in the society via Tik Tok.
