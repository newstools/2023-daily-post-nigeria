The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) secured a total of 3,785 convictions in 2022. The figure was confirmed on January 4 after a review of the commission’s performance in the outgone year. The breakdown shows a 70.5% improvement over its record for 2021 (2,220 convictions). It also represents a 98.93% success rate in prosecution as the anti-graft agency lost only 41 cases, representing 1.07% in 2022. The Lagos Command recorded the most convictions – 765; followed by the Ibadan Command – 573. Port Harcourt Command 567, while the headquarters in Abuja recorded 314. EFCC spokesperson, Wilson Uwujaren said the number of the victories in 2022 is the highest since 2003 when it was established. In 2015, the commission recorded a total of 103 convictions, 195 in 2016, 312 in 2018 and 1280 in 2019. It dropped to 976 in 2020, largely due to the COVID-19 restrictions. The Chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa commended the personnel for their dedication despite the challenges of criminal prosecution in court. Ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo created the EFCC in 2003 after pressure from the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) which named Nigeria as one of the 23 non-cooperative corrupt countries.
