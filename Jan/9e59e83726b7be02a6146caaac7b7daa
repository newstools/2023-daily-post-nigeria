President Muhammadu Buhari has directed the Nigerian armed forces to ensure bandits who killed seven personnel of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) be brought to book. “The Armed Forces must seek the bandits who inflicted this casualty and make them pay the price, “Buhari directed in a terse statement. The President, through the same statement made available to DAILY POST by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu on Thursday, frowned at the death of the personnel, who he said were diligently contributing their quota to national development. The seven personnel of the NSCDC were reportedly ambushed and killed by bandits in Kaduna State while on official duty. Mourning the personnel, Buhari said they died heroes, braving all odds to guard the country and its people. He also described their death as the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. He said his thoughts also go to the bereaved families including their compatriots in service. “May Almighty God grant them and the entire service the fortitude to bear the loss,” he prayed.
