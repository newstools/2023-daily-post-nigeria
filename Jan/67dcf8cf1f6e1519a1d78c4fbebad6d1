One of the spokespersons for the Bola Tinubu, Kashim Shettima Presidential Campaign Council, Festus Keyamo, has slammed the vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Ifeanyi Okowa, for mocking the health condition of the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate. Senator Dino Melaye, a PDP presidential spokesperson, was reported to have, at a campaign rally in Delta State, on Tuesday, made jokes about the health condition of Tinubu in the form of a mock dance. Keyamo, currently the Minister of Labour and Employment, expressed his feelings in a post via his verified Twitter handle on Wednesday. He said Okowa owed Nigerians an apology for laughing away while Melaye performed the act, describing it as a display of imbecility. He wrote, “‘Obama’s rival in 2008 US election, Sen. McCain had a deformity in one hand. Obama’s team showed him respect & NEVER mocked him for it. But here, a VP candidate laughs as a clown falls on stage to mock another candidate. It’s the height of imbecility. They owe Nigerians an apology.”
