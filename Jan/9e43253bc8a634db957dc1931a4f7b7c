Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp, has singled out Brighton’s Kaoru Mitoma for praise, insisting that the player is really good. Klopp also identified defender Trent Alexander-Arnold as the player who did not get support during Liverpool’s FA Cup fourth-round 2-1 defeat to Brighton on Sunday. Klopp watched as Brighton eliminated his team from the FA Cup, following two goals from Lewis Dunk and Mitoma, as Harvey Elliott’s goal was not enough for Liverpool. The FA Cup match was played at the Falmer Stadium. Speaking to the BBC after the game, Klopp said: “On the left side, Robbo was ok because we helped him, but on the other side, Trent did not get the support. “Mitoma is really good, so, of course, it was tough. We could have defended both goals better. The first is deflected, but we can probably block the shot. “It does not feel great. In time we might see the positives, but we wanted to get the next round. Congratulations to Brighton.” Liverpool will now face Wolves next in the Premier League next weekend.
