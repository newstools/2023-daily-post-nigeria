After scaling several political hurdles, Republican Kevin McCarthy emerged as the United States House of Representatives Speaker on Saturday. McCarthy’s emergence has made him the third most powerful person in the US after President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. As he accepted the gavel, McCarthy vowed House Republicans would “pass bills to fix the nation’s challenges, from the wide open southern border to ‘America last’ energy policies, to woke indoctrination in our schools”, AP reported. The US House of Rep gavel battle had a historic 15th round of voting before the Bakersfield, California-born McCarthy’s victory.
