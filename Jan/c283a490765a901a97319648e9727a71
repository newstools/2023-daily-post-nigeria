Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has hailed Aaron Ramsdale’s performance in their 2-0 win over Tottenham on Sunday. Ramsdale produced two excellent saves to deny Heung-Min Son and Harry Kane in the first half. The England international also stopped a close-range effort from Ryan Sessegnon in the second half, as the Gunners took all three points. “He was the difference when we needed him. In the opponent’s box, we didn’t finalise the actions as well as we should have,” Arteta said about Ramsdale. “They have the quality, when you look at Tottenham’s front three – that is always in the back of your mind, “he said. On being eight points clear, he added: “It means that the way we are playing has taken us this far and we should never forget that. We have to continue playing this way or better because the team still has a lot of things that can be improved collectively and individually and if we focus on that, I’m sure we’ll be fine.”
