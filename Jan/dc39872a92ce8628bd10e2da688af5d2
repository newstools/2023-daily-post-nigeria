Governor Ifeanyi Okowa on Friday thanked the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar for selecting him as vice presidential candidate. The Delta helmsman addressed PDP supporters during the party’s campaign in Ika South and Ika North East Local Government Areas of the state. The governor noted that since the old Bendel State, nobody from Delta has emerged the country’s leader or deputy. “I thank the leadership of PDP and our presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, for finding me worthy to be the vice-presidential candidate. “I have challenged our people in Delta that as a state, we must cross the one million votes mark.” Okowa charged the people of Ika to deliver a minimum of 180,000 votes for the PDP. The governor urged them to justify his selection and deliver their wards during the polls. On the choice of Sheriff Oborevwori as the party’s governorship candidate, Okowa said it was “divine”. Atiku picked the former Senator ahead of Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike, the runner up at the PDP national convention last May.
