Nigeria forward, Terem Moffi is not too keen on a move to Premier League club, West Ham United. The Hammers have identified Moffi as one of their key transfer targets this month. His French club, Lorient would accept West Ham’s offer- worth £25m but the player is undecided about the move, a source told Sky Sports. The London club are fighting relegation and the player is not willing to join the London club. The 23-year-old has reportedly agreed to personal terms with Ligue 1 club, OGC Nice but the latter are struggling to meet Lorient’s asking price. Southampton is the other club with a concrete interest in the striker. Moffi has scored 12 goals and made 18 league appearances for Lorient this season.
