Watford legend, Troy Deeney has hailed Arsenal midfielders, Thomas Partey and Granit Xhaka after their victory over Manchester United on Sunday. According to the former striker, the two players have taken their games to an unbelievable level this season.

Arsenal are fighting hard and hoping to win the Premier League this season for the first time since the 2004-5 season.
