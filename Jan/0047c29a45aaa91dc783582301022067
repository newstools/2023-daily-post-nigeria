Jorginho has undergone medical checks with Arsenal ahead of his move from Chelsea. The 31-year-old midfielder has also put pen to paper on an 18-month deal with the Gunners. This comes after both London clubs agreed a £12 million deal for Jorginho. “We can say Jorginho to Arsenal ‘Here We Go,’ the deal is DONE, signed, everything is completed. “Jorginho did the medical tests and signed the contract till June 2024 with an option until 2025. Arsenal paid £10m, plus £2m add-ons,” transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano, said on his YouTube channel. Arsenal decided to move quickly for Jorginho, after seeing Brighton reject two huge bids for Moises Caicedo.
