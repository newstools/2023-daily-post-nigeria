President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday described Boko Haram as “a fraud” and a plot to destabilize Nigeria. Buhari hosted members of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) at the State House, Abuja. The President told the delegation that the gains recorded in security will be further consolidated, promising that more attention will be given to the economy before the May 29 handover date Buhari said the security had improved over the years, particularly in the Northeast where the focus had shifted to rebuilding infrastructure. The President said during his visit to Borno, Adamawa and Yobe States, the people confirmed the situation got better since 2015. “Boko Haram was just fraudulent and a plot to destroy Nigeria. “You can’t say people should not learn; the people need to grow intellectually.” Buhari told the Bishops that the government will continue to rebuild infrastructure in parts of the country affected by terrorist attacks.
