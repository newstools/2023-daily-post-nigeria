The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar on Tuesday berated a former Minister of Education, Oby Ezekwesili for being petty. On Monday, Atiku, while speaking at an event organised by the Nigerian Economic Summit Group, NESG, claimed he played a major role in designing a private sector revival strategy and opening the economy for private sector investments in several sectors. But Ezekwesili, who served along with Atiku during the administration of former president Olusegun Obasanjo described the ex-Vice President as a liar. However, speaking through his spokesman, Paul Ibe, Atiku accused the former minister of resorting to “jaded ‘aproko’ pettiness.” His tweets read: “Dear @obyezeks, I know it’s political season and people resort to all sorts of antics in support of their preferred candidates. But some things should be considered too low. “In trying – and failing – to weaken his standing in public, let us not resort to this sort of jaded ‘aproko’ pettiness. “If Atiku wasn’t head of the Economic Management Team as VP, so who was? You?”
