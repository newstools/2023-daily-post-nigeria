More details have emerged from Chelsea’s pursuit of Benfica midfielder Enzo Fernandez. TalkSPORT’s Alex Crook also provided updates on the potential outgoings at Stamford Bridge. He confirmed Jorginho’s move to Arsenal and Conor Gallagher’s potential move to Newcastle, Everton or Crystal Palace. He said: “We’re still waiting for news from Portugal. The longer the clock ticks, the more you feel this might not happen. “I’m told there will be news one way or another in the next hour or so.” Crook added: “Chelsea hold a lot of cards because Jorginho is off to Arsenal. “Conor Gallagher is heavily sought-after. Newcastle are interested but I don’t see Chelsea selling him to a rival. Everton wanted him but he doesn’t want to go there. “If he does leave, my money will be on Crystal Palace, but there could be a domino effect and I think he will only leave if Fernandez gets signed.”
