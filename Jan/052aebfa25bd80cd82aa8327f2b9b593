The United States on Wednesday announced visa restrictions on specific individuals in Nigeria. The American government said those affected undermined the democratic process in a recent election. The recent electoral race in the country were the governorship polls in Anambra, Ekiti and Osun States. A statement by Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, reiterated the commitment of the U.S. to supporting and advancing democracy in Nigeria and around the world. “Today, I am announcing visa restrictions on specific individuals in Nigeria for undermining the democratic process in a recent Nigerian election.” Under Section 212(a)(3)C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the individuals will be found ineligible for visas to America. Blinken noted that certain family members of such persons may also be subject to these restrictions. “Additional persons who undermine the democratic process in Nigeria—including in the lead-up to, during, and following Nigeria’s 2023 elections—may be found ineligible for U.S. visas under this policy,” he said. Blinken clarified that the latest visa restrictions targets only certain persons and are not directed at the people or the government. “The decision to impose visa restrictions reflects the commitment of the United States to support Nigerian aspirations to combat corruption and strengthen democracy and the rule of law,” the official concluded.
