Chelsea boss Graham Potter has said that Mykhailo Mudryk may be making his debut against Liverpool this weekend. The English coach said he is impressed by how hard the Ukrainian is working in his first week at Chelsea. Chelsea brought in the Ukraine international for an £89m deal from Shakhtar Donetsk last week. Potter said, however, that he wants people to ‘understand’ that the 22-year-old will need time to adapt. “He is a young and exciting player, we have to help him adapt to us and the Premier League,’ Potter said at his pre-match press conference. “There’s a chance [he could make his debut]. There is probably a role for him at some stage in the game. “We’ve got to help him.”
