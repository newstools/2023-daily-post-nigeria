The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has promised that he will end terrorism if elected President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Atiku made the pledge while addressing the people of Zamfara State. “I will reposition Zamfara State in terms of security network, agriculture and solid mineral resources if I am voted into power,” he said. He also, in the same breath, condemned the political leadership of the APC, the ruling government in the state, saying that it has not done enough to salvage the economy and security situations in the country. “I am surprised that the APC is still campaigning in spite of its failures to bring Nigeria under one united entity,” Atiku said. According to him, insecurity will be history in Zamfara State if he wins the February 25 election, stressing that he has no intention to cause division in the polity. “Nigeria is one united entity and nobody has the monopoly to separate what God has joined together; I am calling on Zamfara State people to, as a matter of fact, vote me in and see the differences,” he appealed. Atiku who further stated that he was aware of the socio-economic challenges being faced by Nigerians due to bad leadership in the country, reminded the electorate that [now] they have the constitutional right to vote for their choice of leaders.
