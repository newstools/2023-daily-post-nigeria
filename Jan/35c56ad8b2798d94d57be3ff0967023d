The Kogi State government on Thursday commended the Department of State Services (DSS) for arresting the mastermind of the Okene explosion. An Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) commander, Abdulmumin Ibrahim Otaru, a.k.a. Abu Mikdad is in custody. The Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED) attack near the palace of Ohinoyi of Ebiraland occurred on December 29. President Muhammadu Buhari was in the State on the same day to commission some projects. Commissioner for Information, Kingsley Fanwo said the promptness of the DSS “has further steeled our trust in the security agencies”. Fanwo noted that the arrest justifies the government’s position that enemies are breeding terror cells. He said Kogi would have been turned into a terror zone but for the “master class security architecture”. Fanwo urged security agencies to dig deeper to unravel the intent of the attackers and proffer how to avert future recurrence. The commissioner warned criminals to steer clear “because Kogi will remain inhabitable for cowards masquerading as criminals”.
