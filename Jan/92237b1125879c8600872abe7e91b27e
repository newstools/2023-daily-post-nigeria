Over 60, 000 watched the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) Peter Obi’s presentation at the Chatham House in London. Obi was at the Chatham House to discuss his plans for Nigeria ahead of the February 25 presidential election. He said he would revamp the already impoverished Nigeria’s economy, fight insecurity and corruption, and place the country on the path of rapid economic growth and recovery, adding that he would ensure borrowing in future would only be for investment. The former Anambra State governor also said he would ensure social justice is enthroned in order to discourage social unrest and criminality. “The ethnic tension you see today is a result of injustice, unfairness, exclusion and marginalization; immediately we start reversing that, they (ethnic tensions) start going down. This is what I tell you about agitations, as long as we start doing the right things, as soon as we start building an inclusive society where people’s talent and hard work will match up their opportunities, you will start seeing those things go down. There is tension even in the western world. We will show compassion; we will show love,” Obi said.
