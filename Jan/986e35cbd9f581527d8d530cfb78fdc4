Former Chelsea midfielder, Joe Cole has insisted Joao Felix will be a success at the club despite being sent off on his Premier League debut against Fulham. Felix was shown a straight card in the second half of the Blues’ 2-1 defeat at Craven Cottage. Ex-Blues star, Willian gave Fulham the lead, before Kalidou Koulibaly equalized two minutes after the break. Felix, who completed a loan move from Atletico Madrid earlier in the week, was shown a straight red card for a nasty lunge on Kenny Tete. But Cole had seen enough to be impressed by Felix. He told BT Sport: “I thought Joao Felix was brilliant tonight. “I’ve seen enough to know he’s going to be a good signing for Chelsea. “He showed his ability and personality but that moment of madness changed the game. Felix showed signs he can make a difference in a Chelsea shirt.”
