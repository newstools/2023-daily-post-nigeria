A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Chieftain in Kaura Local Government area of Kaduna State, Mustapha Amodu on Monday appealed for the urgent security of lives and property of not only voters but all those who will participate in the February electoral process. Mustapha Amodu who expressed sadness over the manner the campaign is being conducted without adequate security warned that the security of the lives of ordinary Nigerians is paramount. He said those electorates who are bent on ensuring the right candidate is voted into power, must be guaranteed protection of their lives. He said without voters, there would be no election and if elections are to be free, fair and credible, their lives must be adequately protected. “We cannot only concentrate on campaigning without considering the security aspect of elections. It’s only when the lives of those coming to vote for us, are protected, we will enjoy free and fair elections.” He said Mustapha Amodu called on security agents and the Kaduna State government to ensure the presence of security in all 23 local government areas of Kaduna State before, during and after the general election. He said the security of lives is not only during the election but after the process so that those who lost will not take revenge on the winners.
