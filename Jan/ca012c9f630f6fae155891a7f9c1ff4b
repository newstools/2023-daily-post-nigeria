Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger State has threatened to deal decisively or sanction any filling station found not dispensing its allocation or selling above the stipulated approved pump price for Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) in the state. Bello issued the threat in a statement by the Secretary to the State Government, Ahmed Ibrahim Matane, in Minna, the state capital. The governor decried the difficulties being experienced by the people of the state occasioned by the artificial scarcity and arbitrary pricing of PMS by marketers of the product, stressing that the situation warranted that government takes a drastic position. “The constitution of the committee by the Government followed the persistent fuel scarcity being witnessed in the state as a result of the arbitrary pricing and hoarding of the product,” the statement said. It further stated that the committee is to ensure strict compliance with the approved allocation to filling stations in the state and retail prices for PMS. Matane added that members of the committee were drawn from the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), security agencies and government officials.
