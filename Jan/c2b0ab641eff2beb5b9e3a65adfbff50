Every trace of the power of darkness around your life, family and our nation, I declare that they are buried by Light! “Step into your season of honour, dignity and distinction, Nigeria! Step in! Unusual, stupendous and Supernatural supplies! Royalties, kings and nobles, they shall look for you! And they shall submit! And for you, your tenure on the ground floor has expired! “2023! Light has come! To Nigeria! To your family! To my family”!
