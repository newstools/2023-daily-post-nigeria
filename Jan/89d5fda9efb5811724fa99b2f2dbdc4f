UEFA has picked Lesley Ugochukwu among the top 40 young players who could make an impact on European football this year. Ugochukwu, who plays for Ligue 1 club Stade Rennes, is the cousin of former Super Eagles defender, Onyekachi Apam. The young midfielder was introduced gradually into Rennesâ€™ first team last season. Ugochukwu has featured regularly this term, with his physical and defensive attributes drawing comparisons with France legend, Patrick Vieira. The 18-year-old has represented France at underage level but could still change his international allegiance to Nigeria. Among the other youngsters listed by UEFA are, Destiny Udogie, Moises Caicedo, David Datro Fofana and Alejandro Garnacho.
