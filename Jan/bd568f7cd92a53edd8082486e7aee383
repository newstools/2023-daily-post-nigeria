The youth arm of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, OYC, has urged the Federal Government to prevail on the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, to extend the deadline for the use of old naira notes. OYC Zonal Co-ordinator, South-South Youth Wing, Chinedu Arthur-Ugwa, decried the unavailability of the redesigned naira notes in some commercial banks, NAN reports. Arthur-Ugwa said the new naira notes’ unavailability contributed to the suffering of Nigerians in the rural areas. He urged the apex bank to “monitor commercial banks to ensure compliance with its regulations.” A statement by Arthur-Ugwa reads partly: “Some filling stations demand extra charge from customers for use of their POS machines, while commercial POS operators charge an extra fee for withdrawal of the new notes. The situation is almost unbearable.”
