The presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, Rabiu Kwankwaso, has given more details as to why a proposed merger with Labour Party, LP and its presidential candidate didn’t work out. Speaking at the Chatham House in London on Wednesday, Kwankwaso claimed they couldn’t reach a compromise because LP was at the peak of the media hype. He said: “On Labour Party, I was initially interested in working with them. “But at that time, they were at peak of the media hype and we couldn’t reach a compromise. Our party (NNPP) is a national party, and we’re commanding the support of the masses.” Kwankwaso added: “If you have a party which is based on ethnicity and religion, that is the difference between the Labour party and our party, which is a national party, New Nigeria Peoples Party.”
