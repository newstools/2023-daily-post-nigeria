The Security and Intelligence Committee of the All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council for Bola Tinubu is in Lagos. The delegation was led by retired General Jubril Abdulmalik, National Chairman of Nigeria Legion. Retired General Abayomi Olonisakin, ex-Chief of Defence Staff, and retired General Tukur Buratai, ex-Chief of Army Staff, were on the entourage. Also present were retired Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Hakeem Odumosu and Abdurrazaq Balogun, an ex-lawmaker and Secretary, Lagos State Security Trust Fund (LSSTF). The team met Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, Tuesday evening behind closed doors. Obasa’s Chief Press Secretary, Eromosele Ebhomele said the parley was “a courtesy visit”. The meeting was held a few weeks to the February 25 presidential election. Earlier in his New Year message, Obasa described Tinubu as the hope Nigerians have for a better country, citing the foundation he laid as Lagos governor. “Lagos has become a reference point for other states and some African countries because of the structures that have been put in place since 1999. “We now have a State very attractive to investors and those seeking for better life. This is what Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu wants to replicate at the centre”, he said.
