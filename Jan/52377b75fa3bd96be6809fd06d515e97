The Ohanaeze Ndigbo worldwide has urged South East governors to reach out to President Muhammadu Buhari over the health status of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. The apex Igbo socio-cultural group made the call amid claims that Kanu was being poisoned in the custody of the Department of State Services, DSS, with Ohanaeze Secretary-General, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, urging the Federal Government to allow the IPOB leader full access to his doctors. Isiguzoro told DAILY POST: “Ohanaeze Ndigbo and South East governors will investigate the allegations of the poisoning of Nnamdi Kanu. FG should allow family doctors to assess Nnamdi Kanu so that Ndigbo can quench the incitement of violence. “The South East governors should quickly reach out to President Buhari to ascertain the degree of the alleged sickness of Nnamdi Kanu.” Lately, there have been reports accusing the Department of State Services, DSS, of poisoning Kanu in its custody. IPOB had accused DSS of secretly killing Kanu by refusing him access to his doctors and adequate medications. However, an operative of the secret police denied the allegation, stressing that the IPOB leader was being taken care of in custody.
