A trader, Sarata Olagunju, on Thursday, told a Mapo Grade ‘A’ Customary Court in Ibadan to grant her divorce on the grounds that her husband, Adewale, said the union was being controlled by demonic spirits. In her counterargument against her husband, Oagunju said: “He told me that there were demonic spirits in our house and I must leave immediately. ”I had a miscarriage in 2005, and ever since then, I haven’t conceived again. Olagunju took me to his clergyman, who told me to perform some fetish things, and I obeyed them. “Olagunju told me to leave the house due to the presence of Gins or demonic spirits in the house. ”I have been living all alone since then.” Earlier, Olagunju, a scrap dealer, explained that he filed the suit due to childlessness. The petitioner said that he did not pay the necessary bride price before she moved in with him. Delivering judgment, the court’s President, Mrs S.M. Akintayo, held that there was no marriage to be dissolved between Sarata and Olagunju because no bride price was paid. Citing portions of the law to support her judgment, Akintayo declared that Sarata and Olagunju were merely cohabiting. However, she granted Olagunju’s request that the court should restrain the respondent, Sarata from harassing, intimidating, molesting and interfering with the private life of the petitioner.
