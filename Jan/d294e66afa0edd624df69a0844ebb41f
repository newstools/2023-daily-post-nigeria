Manchester United are on the verge of bringing Marcel Sabitzer from Bayern Munich as a replacement for injured Christian Eriksen. Christian Eriksen will spend up to four months on the sideline after a terrible injury he sustained during their FA Cup victory over Reading at the weekend. Reading’s Andy Carroll was sent off after a horrendous tackle on the Dane whose injury now leaves United with Fred, Casemiro and Scott McTominay as available midfield options. According to the Athletic, Erik ten Hag now wants Marcel Sabitzer to cover for the Denmark international for as long as he stays sidelined. The midfielder has 68 caps for Austria and has appeared for Bayern 45 times since his switch from RB Leipzig two years ago. It’s unclear if the talks surround a permanent move or an emergency loan option but it is clear that ten Hag feels he’s light in midfield.
