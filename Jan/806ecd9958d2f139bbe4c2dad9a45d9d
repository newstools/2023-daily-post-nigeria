Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has ordered the Ogun State police command to go after the murderers of Mr and Mrs Kehinde Fatinoye, who were killed on January 1. DAILY POST reported earlier that some yet-to-be identified persons had attacked the Fatinoyes immediately they returned from the New Cross Over service on Sunday, killing them and setting them ablaze. The husband was until his death a staffer of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Abeokuta, while the wife occupied the office of the Principal Confidential Secretary at the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB). Their only son, who was kidnapped by the assailants, was found dead on Tuesday inside the Ogun river. Reacting in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, on Wednesday, Abiodun declared that the killers would not go unpunished, hence, “the police must go after them and apprehend them.” Abiodun, who described the incident as unfortunate and heart-breaking, vowed that his government would not hesitate to deploy resources towards unmasking those behind the dastardly act. Abiodun said he was shocked by the incident, particularly when his administration had made efforts towards strengthening the security architecture within the State. “No effort would be spared in bringing the perpetrators of the heinous crime to book,” he said. While sympathising with the families of the deceased, Abiodun said logistic support would be rendered to the police to ensure that the crime does not go down as one of the unresolved murder incident in history.
