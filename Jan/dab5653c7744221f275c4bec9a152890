Former Jigawa State Deputy Governor Ahmad Mahmud said a tsunami will hit the ruling All Progressive Congress, APC, in the state in the next two weeks. Mahmud stated this while speaking to journalists shortly after he formally decamped to PDP from APC in Bamaina. He said work is in progress to end the era of APC in Jigawa State and Nigeria in general. He said: “I have already talked to my political allies and other good people of Jigawa State in APC, all have accepted to dump the party and join PDP. “In the last eight years, APC has destroyed all the foundations of peace and progress Jigawa State was built on and drifted it to the path of total collapse. ” He enjoined his supporters to join hands with other PDP members to ensure the party wins the coming 2023 general election.
