Following the crisis that rocked Ikare-Akoko, the headquarters of Akoko North East Local Government Area of Ondo State, the state government has relaxed the 24-hour curfew earlier imposed on the community. Bamidele Ademola-Olateju, the Commissioner for Information and Orientation, disclosed that the decision was taken at the State Executive Council meeting, revealing that the curfew had been relaxed from 6 pm to 6 am. She claimed that the two monarchs, Olukare of Ikare and Owa-Ale have received strong instructions to act in accordance with government directives, emphasising that failure to do so could result in the concerned kabiyesi being banished. According to the government spokesperson, a five-member committee has also been constituted to investigate the Ikare dilemma and make recommendations regarding a solution to the Okoja problem and the Oloko intercession. The committee whose chairman is Bashorun Sehinde, has as members Chief Jamiu Afolabi Ekungba, Dr. Tunji Abayomi, Mrs. Oreoluwa Agbayewa, and Mr. Joseph Dele Adesanmi, who serves as secretary. “The Oloko intercession issue will also be looked into. From now on, the Council has resolved that no one should parade himself as the Olokoja of Okoja, either the one installed by Owo Ale or Olukare. “All minor chiefs installed by the Olokoja should stop parading themselves as chiefs henceforth. Whoever does so will be arrested and will face consequences,” Ademola-Olateju instructed.
