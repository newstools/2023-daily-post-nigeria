Residents of Kaduna State expressed hope of love, end to bandit attacks, employment opportunities and peace as they ushered in 2023. With all the expectations, Christians in the state thronged various churches for cross-over night service, praying fervently for renewed hope in the new year. Non-Christians were not left out. Unlike Christians, they remained in their houses, praying according to their faiths. Miss Josephine U. Daniel, a 2017 graduate of microbiology, said she prayed to get a job in 2023 and subsequently get married. Julius Moses, a 50-year-old farmer, prayed for an end to bandit attacks in the state and kidnappings and killings. “We need peace in this country as we approach the 2023 election. If there is no peace, there won’t be elections. May God also put an end to kidnapping and killings this year,” he prayed. Usman Abubakar, a 41-year-old, said he hoped to complete the university education he started seven years ago but could not finish due to incessant strikes by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). “I was admitted to study a course of five years, but now, I am into the seventh year because of incessant strikes by ASUU. It’s my prayers to finish successful this year,” he said. Hajia Salamatu Damilola requested and prayed to God to provide good husbands to her five daughters this year. According to her, “I have five graduates in my house without work, husband. It’s my sincere prayers and thoughts that they will all marry, and get good jobs to sustain them in 2023 and beyond. Also, a 70-year-old farmer, Mr. Dauda Makadi, said he hoped for an end to insecurity so that farmers could go to their farms, this year, and make good harvests. “We left our farms, abandoned our homes to stay in town at the peak of bandits’attack. Since then, all our farm produce were left rotting. It’s my prayers that we do not experience any form of bandits’attack this year so we resume farming,” he said.
