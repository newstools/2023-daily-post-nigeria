Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, NMDPRA, on Thursday, sealed eight filling stations in Osun State for allegedly selling Premium Motor Spirit, PMS, above the government-approved pump price. NMDPRA coordinator in the state, Mr Kunle Adeyemo, said this after the agency’s routine surveillance of filling stations in Osogbo, the state capital. Adeyemo said that the surveillance was aimed at sensitising the public that the pump price of petrol, as approved by the Federal Government, had not changed. He said that the surveillance operation would continue on a daily basis until all marketers within the state reverted to the government-approved price for PMS. “We are out basically because prices of fuel are getting erratic and we are trying to tell the people that there is a specific price for petroleum and government has not changed it. “We want to ensure that every filling station in the state adheres strictly to the official price of between N179 and N180 per litre,” he said. Adeyemo said that the affected filling stations were sealed for selling above the official pump price. He added that the agency would continue to work round the clock to ensure that the masses are not in any way cheated by petroleum marketers.
