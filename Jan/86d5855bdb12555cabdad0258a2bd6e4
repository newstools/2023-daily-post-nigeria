The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Friday said banks would be working on Saturdays to receive the old Naira notes from customers. Mr Kama Ukpai, leader of the CBN team to Ebonyi on new Naira notes, disclosed this during its enlightenment campaign on traders at the Eke Market, Afikpo. Ukpai advised the public to visit banks to deposit old naira notes as there would be no extension on the Jan. 31 deadline for the notes’ submission. “Banks would work on Saturdays for this purpose and there are no limits to amounts that can be deposited. “The CBN team is in Ebonyi to ensure the implementation of the directives as we have not directed any bank to stop collecting old notes,” he said.
