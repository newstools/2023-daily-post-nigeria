Brighton winger, Leandro Trossard, has flown into London for his medicals with Arsenal ahead of a potential transfer. The Gunners have agreed a £27m deal for the 28-year-old with their Premier League rivals. “Leandro Trossard to Arsenal, here we go! Full agreement reached between clubs w/Brighton for £27m — personal terms agreed. Exclusive news confirmed. “Trossard will sign his Arsenal contract soon — medical tests will take place in London. Contracts to be prepared soon,” transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano, tweeted today. Mikel Arteta has identified Trossard as the player to bolster his attacking options, after missing out on Mykhailo Mudryk. Trossard wants to leave Brighton after falling out with manager Roberto De Zerbi. The winger has just six months left on his deal, although the club has the option to extend his contract by a year.
