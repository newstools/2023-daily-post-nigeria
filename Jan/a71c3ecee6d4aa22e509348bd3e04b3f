The Speaker of Adamawa State House of Assembly, Aminu Iya Abbas, has asked the Court of Appeal to set aside a judgement of the Federal High Court voiding his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ticket for the State’s Central Senatorial election. The Speaker whose ticket was voided on November 28 last year by the Federal High Court, had early in December instituted an appeal, asking the Yola Division of the Court of Appeal to upturn the trial court’s verdict. Iya Abbas had prayed the appellate court to allow his appeal, nullify the judgement of the lower court and restore him as the duly elected candidate of the PDP for the central Adamawa district. He is also asking the appellate court to strike out the originating summons filed before the trial court by the 2nd respondent in the appeal, Ibrahim Mustapha who had instituted the High Court case that nullified his ticket. DAILY POST recalls that the Speaker’s ticket was invalidated over the participation of Dr Auwal Tukur in the May 2022 senatorial primary of the PDP which Iya Abbas won. The trial court had ruled that Auwal Tukur incorrectly participated in the exercise, as he did not resign his appointment as the Chairman of Governing Council of the Adamawa State University(ADSU) Mubi. In his related appeal, Auwal Tukur, through his counsel Eyitayo Jegede, asked the Appeal Court to vacate the orders made by the lower court on the case. The Court of Appeal presided by Justice Habeeb Abiru, responded during its Thursday sitting by reserving judgement for a date to be communicated to the parties in the case.
