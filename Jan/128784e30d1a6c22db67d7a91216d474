Alex Iwobi will undergo a scan to determine the extent of the injury he sustained in Everton’s 3-1 defeat to Manchester United in their Emirates FA Cup clash on Friday night. Iwobi was stretchered off the pitch in the second half following a horrific tackle from Tyrell Malacia. The Nigeria international is now expected to spend a lengthy time on the sidelines. But Lampard is hopeful the injury is not too serious and is looking forward to having his star man back in action soon. “We hope it’s not too serious. It looks like an ankle ligament injury. He will have a scan tomorrow (today) to confirm,” the former England international told the club’s official website. Iwobi has been one of the key stars for Everton this season. His potential absence will be a major blow for the Toffees who are still in a relegation fight.
