The Federal Government has responded to the decision by the United States of America to slam a visa ban on some Nigerians undermining democracy. Clearing the air on numerous media requests the government has received on the matter, Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Information and Culture, said whatever action is taken against anyone who undermines the country’s democracy is right and justified. Lai Mohammed went on to boast that no administration since Nigeria’s return to democratic rule in 1999 has shown more fidelity to the democratic process than the Buhari government. According to the minister, who spoke on Monday at the 20th edition of the PMB Administration Scorecard Series (2015-2023), no President since 1999 has been as unambiguous as President Muhammadu Buhari, in word and deed, with regards to leaving office after the constitutionally-stipulated two terms. “Let me be clear, whatever action is taken against anyone who undermines this democracy that has been watered by the blood of many of our patriots is right and justified. For us as a government,” he said. He added that “President Buhari has left no one in doubt of his dogged determination to ensure free, fair and credible elections, handover to a successor elected by Nigerians and then return to Daura after the May 29, 2023 handover date. As recently as this past Friday, when he visited the Emir of Daura, Mr. President still told the Emirate that he would return and settle down in Daura after handing over on May 29, 2023. “The President has also given unprecedented support to INEC while also signing into law the Electoral Bill 2022 that Nigerians have hailed as a reason to have confidence in the electoral process.”
