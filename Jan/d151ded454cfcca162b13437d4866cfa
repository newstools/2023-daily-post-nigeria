Religious groups and civil society organizations (CSOs) in Nigeria have appealed to government and security personnel not to leave any stone unturned in prosecuting anyone involved in election violence. This is to ensure a hitch-free 2023 general election. A communique to this effect was issued after a dialogue organized by the Global Peace Foundation in partnership with ADF International and Vision Africa and attended by many stakeholders. It had representatives from the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSIA), Arewa Consultative Forum, Northern Elders Forum, Christians Lawyers Association of Nigeria, Nigeria Inter-Religious Council, youth representing the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), People Living With Disability (PLWD), National Council of Muslim Youth Organisation (NACOMYO) and the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN, Youth Wing). The participants observed that the prosecution of people involved in election violence would serve as a deterrent to others and create a conducive environment for Nigerians to elect candidates of their choice without any molestation. According to the communique, Nigerians should embrace religious freedom for a more united, peaceful and prosperous country. The communique said in recognition of Nigeriaâ€™s status as the largest democracy in Africa, with an electorate that is composed mainly of younger voters that rely upon free and fair elections, the government must ensure the legitimacy and stability of the electoral process. The participants emphasized that INEC must avoid poor coordination of the electoral process.
