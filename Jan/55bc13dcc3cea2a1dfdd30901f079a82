The leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has predicted the outcome of the governorship elections in Abia, Taraba, and Katsina states. Ayodele said the Labour Party, LP, governorship candidate in Abia State, Alex Otti, and YPP, Engr Enyinnaya Nwafor, have brighter chances than other parties in the state if they can work and strategize properly. He explained that the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, will be thrown into chaos while the candidate of All Progressive Grand Alliance, APGA, Greg Ibe, would be incapacitated with a terminal illness. According to Ayodele: “In Abia State, if the PDP isn’t careful, their candidate will be challenged to contest this election. If Labour Party candidate, Alex Otti works hard and strategizes properly, his name will be everywhere. “YPP candidate, Enyinnaya Nwafor can also make a very good move but APGA’s candidate, Greg Ibe will be incapacitated because I see a terminal disease happening to him. “The PDP members will be in disarray, they must strategize well otherwise their candidate will not make any serious impact. Labour party can pull a huge surprise in the state.” In Taraba State, the clergyman said PDP governorship candidate, Kefas Agbu, would win the election and the party would fare well in the presidential election in the state. “The Taraba PDP candidate, Kefas Agbu will excel no matter the circumstances and situation, he will make an impact. PDP will win in Taraba State both in governorship and presidential,” Ayodele said. In Katsina State, he cautioned the All Progressives Congress, APC, to be careful of the PDP because the latter would pull surprises in the state. Ayodele also cautioned members of the APC to be wary of internal betrayal. He noted that the PDP would win the governorship election if the poll is not rigged.
