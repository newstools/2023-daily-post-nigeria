Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta has identified Fabio Vieira as one player who helped his team defeat Oxford United in Monday’s FA Cup third-round tie. Arteta said Vieira contributed in a big way to Arsenal’s win over Oxford United at the Kassam Stadium. The Spaniard said this while commenting on Vieira’s performance during the encounter. Arteta watched as a goal from Mohamed Elneny and a brace from Eddie Nketiah gave Arsenal the victory over Oxford United. Speaking at his post-match press conference, Arteta said, “I was really happy. Obviously, he [Vieira] contributed in a big way to win the game. “That is his quality: to create goals, to decide games in the final third and he had two really good moments that helped us win the game.” Arsenal will now face Manchester City in the FA Cup fourth-round tie later this month.
