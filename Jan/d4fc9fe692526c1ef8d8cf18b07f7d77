The senatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun Central, Olumide Aderinokun, has allayed the fear that the presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar, would marginalise the people of the South if elected. For being a northerner, some Nigerians have been raising the suspicion that an Atiku presidency would mean another opportunity for northerners at the expense of the South. But, during his tour to Odeda Local Government, Aderinokun described Atiku as a unifier. According to him, Atiku is ready to unite Nigeria, saying “We are one and no one should think he can marginalise our Nigeria for anything.” Aderinokun maintained that Atiku would not favour any zone while neglecting the other. Speaking further, Owu chief also described the governorship candidate of the PDP in Ogun, Ladi Adebutu, as a compassionate fellow, who is poised to making Ogun State better again by bringing relief to the people of Ogun State. He noted that Atiku, Adebutu and other candidates of the PDP can feel “the hardship everybody is going through under this current government,” saying “the PDP is ready to make things better with our relief plan.”
