Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, has sworn in Justice Matilda Ayemieye as the acting chief judge of the state. Ayemieye took the oath in an acting capacity at a brief ceremony conducted in the Executive Council Chambers in Government House, Yenagoa, on Monday. Her swearing-in followed last week’s retirement of Justice Kate Abiri, who served as chief judge of the state for 15 years. Diri tasked the new acting chief judge to sustain the cordial relationship between the executive and judicial arms of government in the state. The governor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Daniel Alabrah, noted that Ayemieye was eminently qualified for the position as the most senior judge in the state judiciary. He urged her to carry her colleagues along in the scheme of things in order to move the state judiciary to greater heights. He called on other members of the judiciary to support Ayemieye to enable her to succeed. “The newly appointed Acting Chief Judge was the most senior of the judges and has been working harmoniously with her predecessor, who also worked harmoniously with the other arms of government. “So, beyond being a high court judge, you are now in government as the leader of the judicial arm. We expect that you will maintain the same harmonious relationship that this government has enjoyed with the judicial arm of government. “Having gone through your CV, you have the pedigree to lead the judiciary. So, I wish you well and urge you to carry your colleagues along without discrimination. I pray that going forward you will move the state judiciary to greater heights,” the governor stated.
