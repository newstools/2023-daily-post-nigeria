Controversial Nigerian singer, Habeeb Okikiola, also known as Portable has gone on a rant after Nigerian music director and cinematographer, ThankGod Omori Smith, known as TG Omori or Boy Director, billed him $50,000 (over N22 million) for a video shoot. Portable in a now leaked chat on social media requested TG Omori to shoot his video claiming he does not have money but he is loyal to the video director. In response to the request, TG Omori demanded $50k from him, which infuriated the ”Zazu Zeh” crooner, who asked him if he produces videos for ghosts. Portable stated his displeasure in the voice notes he sent to TG, stating that the video director had made a mistake. The duo have been trending on Twitter, with many music lovers wading into the discourse. Portable isn’t the first to protest TG’s rates. In 2022 Blaqbonez did the same after being billed $30,000.
