The Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, said there is no going back on the 31 January deadline to stop using old bank notes in the country. CBN Dutse branch controller, Jigawa State Hajiya Sa’adatu Ibrahim stated this when she visited Dutse Central market while sensitizing traders. Sa’adatu gave several reasons that necessitated the naira redesign which included fighting against corruption, inflation, fake currency, insecurity, and hoarding of currency. She stated that the apex bank will not allow any act of sabotage in the implementation of the new naira policy. She called on business people and the general public to continue accepting the old note till January 31 and to also not delay in depositing the old notes to the nearest bank in exchange for new ones. The chairman Jigawa Marketers Association, Alhaji Yahaya Kwaimawa, commended the CBN for its efforts in redesigning the naira and imposing a new e-naira policy and cashless policies. He said the new policies will help in reducing armed robbery and money laundering across Nigeria.
