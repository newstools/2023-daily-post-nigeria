Former Crystal Palace manager, Tony Pulis, has named Arsenal as the best team in the Premier League at the moment. Pulis also said Arsenal need three more quality signings in the January transfer window in order to challenge Manchester City for the Premier League title this season. Arsenal are currently on top of the Premier League table with seven points ahead of second position Man City. Mikel Arteta’s side will take on Newcastle United in Tuesday’s Premier League tie at the Emirates Stadium. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Pulis said, “You have got to give a lot of credit to the directors and the owners [of Arsenal football club]. He [Mikel Arteta] was under a lot of pressure for a lot of time. “The team he [Arteta] has put together, the way they play, they’ve strength, pace, power and a lot of quality as well.” He added: “I think they need three more players, three top-quality players within the group. Then you can look at them and say they would have the depth to compete with Manchester City. “At the moment, they are the best team in the league, and they deserve to be the best team in the league with the way they’re playing. Sir Alex used to say the season doesn’t really get going until March. Let’s see what the league is like then.”
