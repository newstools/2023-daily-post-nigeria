The Director General of Nigeria Mining Cadastre, Obadiah Nkom, on Thursday disclosed that the office generated N14.6 billion from 2018 to 2022 from the issuance of mining licences. Nkom made this disclosure at the 63rd session of the ministerial briefing organised by the Presidential Communications Team at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Also, he said the office revoked 3,402 dormant titles, adding that the agency ensures that only the rightful people are given licenses. He also disclosed that Nigeria’s coal had become a universally sought-after resource. According to him, in 2018, 2019 and 2020, the agency generated N1.55 billion, N2.38 billion and N2.57 billion, respectively. However, between 2021 and 2022, its revenue fell from N4.3 billion to N3.79 billion. Nkom explained that the agency’s revenue dropped due to changes in its internal operating system which temporarily affected revenue inflow.
