The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has rejected the judgment of the Osun State Governorship Election Tribunal which sacked Governor Ademola Adeleke. PDP said the judgment is contrary to the will of the Osun people. The ruling party in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, on Friday insisted that Adeleke’s victory was lawful. PDP claimed the will of Osun people was expressed by the overwhelming votes cast for its party and Adeleke at the election. The statement reads in part; “The July 16, 2022 governorship election in Osun State was adjudged by local and international observers to be free, fair, transparent and clearly won by the PDP and our candidate, Governor Ademola Adeleke in confirmation of the wishes and aspiration of the people. “The will of the people of Osun State as expressed by electing Governor Adeleke must be respected. As a law-abiding party, the PDP will explore all available legal means to restore the victory of our party. “The PDP charges the people of Osun State to be calm, remain at alert and continue to support Governor Adeleke as we restate our confidence in the institution of the judiciary to dispense justice in this matter at the Appellate Court.”
