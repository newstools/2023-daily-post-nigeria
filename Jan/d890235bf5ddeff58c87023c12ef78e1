The Independent National Electoral Commission’s (INEC) Director for Voter Education and Publicity, Victor Aluko, has described as false allegations that its staff are colluding with certain people to prevent eligible Nigerians from collecting their Permanent Voters Cards, PVCs. Aluko made the statement on Friday while fielding questions on the Channels Television’s Politics Today programme. He said any of its staff found to be obstructing Nigerians from collecting their PVCs would be punished and prosecuted. “Well, personally, I don’t believe so. I don’t believe that anybody is colluding with anyone to prevent eligible Nigerians from collecting their PVCs. I don’t think so. “Yes, we thank Nigerians for trusting us and believing in us. And the stand of the commission is that any of our staff that is found to have done such a thing will be punished and even prosecuted because it is against the law to deny eligible persons from collecting their PVCs. That is obstruction, and any staff that is found to have done such a thing will be punished. “If anyone sees a staff doing such a thing, please report them, and the commission will not sweep it under the carpet; such staff in any part of the country will be punished,” Aluko said.
