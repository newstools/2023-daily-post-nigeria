A human rights activist, Adeniyi Alimi Sulaiman has told former governor of Osun State, Adegboyega Oyetola and his supporters to forget about coming back as governor of the State. Recall that the Speaker of the Osun House of Assembly, Timothy Owoeye had on Friday during the inauguration of the Tinubu/Shettima Presidential Campaign Committee in Osogbo stated that Oyetola would return as governor of the State before July 5, 2023. Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress, APC, emerged second best during the July 16, 2022 gubernatorial election in the State, coming behind Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. In a personally signed statement on Tuesday, the activist told the APC to put a stop to their dreams of coming back to governance in the State. Sulaiman, who is the Executive Chairman, Centre for Human Rights and Social Justice (CHRSJ), urged them to accept their loss at the July 16, 2022 gubernatorial election in good faith in the spirit of sportsmanship and to prepare for the 2026 election in the State. “Thinking of manipulating the electoral and judicial process if Bola Ahmed Tinubu wins the Presidential election to stage come back to power through the back door cannot be fruitful for Gboyega Oyetola because the law in respect of Electoral Act 2022 has settled everything and no President can manipulate such electoral process again. “Nigeria is not a banana republic where law would be made to satisfy the whims and caprices of Gboyega Oyetola and Bola Tinubu. For instance, all the opposition Governors the Courts ruled in their favour that led to the conduct of staggering Governorship elections in the country today, were during the period of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidency and heaven did not fall,” he said. On the ongoing Osun Election Petition Tribunal, the Pro-democracy activist noted that the tribunal was not set up to favour any political party but to deal with post election issues.
