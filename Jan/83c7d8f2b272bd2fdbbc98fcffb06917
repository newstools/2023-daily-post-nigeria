Super Eagles goalkeeper trainer Ike Shorummu believes the Nigeria Professional Football League will produce quality shot-stoppers soon. The team is yet to have a reliable number-one goalkeeper since Vincent Enyeama quit international football a few years ago. The likes of Francis Uzoho, Daniel Akpeyi, Ikechukwu Ezenwa and Maduka Okoye have failed to impress between the sticks. Shorummu himself was a product of the NPFL, having made his name with the defunct Stationery Stores and Shooting Stars. The 55-year-old is confident the next set of goalkeepers for the Super Eagles will come from the NPFL. “We are looking inwards, we would be more of our League because it is better we start from home, all our qualifiers are played in Africa, we have experimented enough,” Shorummu told Brila FM. “But then, we need to look inward back home here in our league and we will see how far it goes. When the league settles down, we will now look into our programme and fit it into their own programme.”
