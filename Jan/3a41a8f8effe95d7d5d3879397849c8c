Chelsea legend, Pat Nevin, has revealed manager Graham Potter’s problem at Stamford Bridge. According to Neville, qualifying Chelsea for next season’s UEFA Champions League is now Potter’s problem. Chelsea is currently in tenth position on the Premier League table with 17 points from 25 games ahead of their clash with Fulham on Thursday night. Asked if Potter should be afraid of the possibility of getting sacked by Chelsea co-owner, Todd Bohely after losing six games this season, Nevin told Metro UK: “That is the normal narrative, but I don’t know if that will work with the new owners – it may. “But in normal times, that’s what happens at a number of clubs. I don’t know if that is the case at Chelsea anymore. It is easy to say, ‘You are not winning games’, but the club has had a change of ownership, there is a lot to learn and there has been a massive transition. “When Todd Boehly bought the club, he said their intention was to let it grow and we all thought, ‘Yeah, right’, but so far, so good. Nobody would pretend it is good at the moment, but I have no idea if they would act as the previous owner would’ve done. “The proof will be in the pudding over time. Qualifying for the Champions League is now a long shot and that is Potter’s problem.”
