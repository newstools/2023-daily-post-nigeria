The Congress of Northern Nigeria Christians, CNNC, said Nigerians have an opportunity to put the country on the right path by electing credible leaders in next month’s general elections. Speaking to newsmen in Kaduna on Wednesday, the group’s spokesman, Dr Iliya Yusuf, stated that it is no longer news that Nigerians in different parts of the country are experiencing various types of challenges ranging from killings, kidnapping, cattle rustling, destruction of valuables to other criminal activities that have become the order of the day. With this year’s general elections around the corner, he called on all Northern Christians, all people of goodwill and those who truly love the unity of Nigeria, to stick together both at the local and National levels and speak with one voice in choosing new credible leaders that will pilot the affairs of the country to the promised land. Steven Bangoji, national president of the congress, enjoined Nigerians to ensure they vote credible candidates into elective offices, stressing that the country at the moment requires good leadership that will change the narratives of the present happenings in the country. According to him: “It is high time that people of goodwill ensured that responsible people take [over] the affairs of the land for Nigerians to experience new hope of life in a country that is so blessed with both natural and human resources and requires a good leader to ensure the right thing is done for the country to prosper in all ramifications.” He enjoined Nigerians to see the coming general elections as a time not to allow religion, tribe or sectional interest to becloud their sense of judgement but to ensure that only candidates of goodwill are elected into various political offices for the overall unity, peace and development of the country.
