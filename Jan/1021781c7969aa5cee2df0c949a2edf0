Erik ten Hag has blocked Manchester United winger Anthony Elanga from moving to Everton this January. Everton wanted to sign the player on loan due to the current gloomy situation at Goodison Park. Frank Lampard’s team are currently 19th in the Premier League table and may escape relegation should the situation remain like this. The club’s fans are at loggerheads with the team and Daily Star reports that Ten Hag has reservations about the Swede joining Everton. He is concerned that the current climate at Goodison Park could stunt Elanga’s development and progress. Lampard is desperately in need of attacking options and is keen on luring the attacker to Everton to try and turn things around. Elanga has found it difficult to break into Erik ten Hag’s team this season, making 19 appearances across competitions.
