The opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has expressed worry over what Nigerians are going through due to the scarcity of redesigned Naira notes in circulation. The party’s gubernatorial candidate in Jigawa State, Dr. Mustapha Sule Lamido lamented on Thursday while addressing the party’s supporters in Sule-Tankarkar local government. He said Nigerians are in pain and hardship especially those in the hard-to-reach areas because of the deadline given by the Central Bank of Nigeria. DAILY POST reported that traders in Jigawa State have shut down their businesses over the scarcity of the new Naira notes. Lamido said a responsible government should come out with a policy that benefits its citizens not put them into hardship and difficult situations. “What we observed today during our rally is people are suffering because of the rejection of the old notes by some traders, especially in rural areas. “To spend your hard-earned money now is a problem and to change it is another because of the none availability of banks in most of the communities,” he said. He blamed the All Progressives Congress administration for deliberate plans to create unnecessary hardship for Nigerians. According to him, “apart from the difficult situation the APC’s led administration had put Nigerian through insecurity, fuel scarcity, inflation and increase in the University registration fees it also adding salt to the injuries through its new naira policy.” The PDP gubernatorial candidate, however, advised Nigerians to consider the situation and vote out the APC in the forthcoming election.
