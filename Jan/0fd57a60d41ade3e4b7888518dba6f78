The So-Safe Corps in Ogun State has arrested two men for allegedly stealing a Bajaj motorcycle at Ita-Egbe, Ipokia Local Government Area of Ogun State, while also recovering the stolen bike. A statement by the So-Safe State Commander, Mr Soji Ganzallo, said the suspects were nabbed on January 4 by his men at Idiroko division, while on routine patrol. Ganzallo identified the suspects as 32-year-old Adeyanju Daniel, a resident of Baba Uwuku House, Oko Cashew, Ihunbo in Ipokia LG and 26-year-old Emmadu Mathew, who resides at Izini, Iponle, Isakete, Republic of Benin. The two were arrested “while they were battling over a motorbike, suspected to have been stolen.” Ganzallo said that the two suspects were questioned and asked to provide particulars of the motorbike, but they tried to escape, fuelling speculations that the motorbike did not belong to them. Ganzallo said that the So-Safe team got to know during interrogation that “the motorbike was stolen at Ita-Egbe.” The Red Bajaj motorbike marked TRE 742 UX, was later discovered to belong to Mr Wasiu Akanni, who came for the New Year Festival in his hometown, Ita-Egbe December 31, 2022. He had parked the motorbike beside his family house, but it got missing where it was parked.
