No fewer than 15 suspected smugglers have been arrested by the Ogun 1 Area Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS). The Controller of the Command, Bamidele Makinde, said the suspects were arrested by officials of the NCS at different locations in the State. According to Makinde, they were nabbed at different exit points with prohibited items like foreign parboiled rice, used cars, petroleum products, cannabis sativa, used clothes, bags, shoes, tyres and others. The NCS boss told DAILY POST that some of the arrested suspects are currently in court facing prosecution, while others have been granted administrative bail. “The Command arrested 15 suspected smugglers. They were arrested at different locations and exit points within Ogun State with prohibited goods. “While some of them were granted administrative bail and have yet to be charged to court, some were charged to court for prosecution,” Makinde explained. Speaking further, the Controller disclosed that Section 8 of CEMA CAP C45 LFN of 2004 empowers Customs officers to arrest, detain and prosecute persons who commit customs-related offences like smuggling. He added that the law gives the NCS the power to patrol, to search premises and to search any person.
