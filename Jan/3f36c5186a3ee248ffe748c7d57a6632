Pawel Zimonczyk, Jakub Kiwior’s agent has revealed that the Arsenal new boy will be battling for a position with Brazilian defender Gabriel. He said the Poland international was signed to compete for the left centre-back role with the Brazilian. Jakub joined Arsenal from Spezia earlier this week in a deal that could reach £21million. And there has been speculation over the void the Pole has come to fill in an Arsenal team that are doing very well in all departments. Kiwior, a versatile defender, could play in several positions in the backline and could also line up in defensive midfield. But Zimonczyk, has confirmed that Kiwior will battle it out with Gabriel Magalhaes’ for the left centre-back position. Speaking to Kanal Sportowy, he explained: “The plan is clear. When I went to London Colney there was a tactical board where the players in each position were ranked 1, 2, 3. “There was an empty space under Gabriel. I don’t know if it was a tactical ploy to get us a little bit [laughs]. “His role will be to compete with Gabriel, but Kuba has the versatility to play in other positions.”
