Popular Nigerian activist and social critic, Aisha Yesufu has said she would keep on pressing the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi to do the right things. Yesufu disclosed this in a post via her verified Twitter handle. The social critic was reacting to a recent statement by Obi while appearing on Berekete Family Love FM, saying he (Obi) always moves around with Yesufu to hear bad comments. “I want to hear the bad comments also. I want to hear the bad news. That’s why I move about with Aisha Yesufu,” Obi said. However, Yesufu maintained it is her job to keep the former Anambra State governor on his toes. She wrote, “That is my job oooh! I am not there to do ‘Your excellency, your excellency’ “My job is to keep telling him what the people are going through and in fairness to him he asks me to always tell him the things he is not getting right.”
