Famous Nigerian musician, David Adeleke, professionally known by his stage name Davido and his wife Chioma, have gotten customised matching tattoos on each other’s ring fingers. The couple, in a trending video on social media, was seen getting each other’s name tattooed on their ring fingers. This is coming barely a week since the singer updated her marital status on his Wikipedia profile after finalising Chioma’s bride price on the 5th of January 2023. The singer had, earlier in November 2022, got married to Chioma secretly, a month after the death of their son, Ifeanyi Adeleke. Recall that Davido had in 2022, before the tragic incident, vowed to marry Chioma in 2023, but after their son’s death, the singer speedily wedded her privately.
