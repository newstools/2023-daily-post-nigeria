Frank Lampard is set to be sacked as Everton manager, following a 2-0 defeat at West Ham on Saturday, according to SportsMail. Jarrod Bowen scored a brace in the first half to ensure the Toffees lost their sixth match in seven Premier League fixtures. The result leaves Everton sitting in 19th place on the table, only above Southampton on goal difference. Everton owner, Farhad Moshiri, watched on as the team lost at the London Stadium. And he offered Lampard no public reassurances in the wake of a poor performance against their relegation rivals. When asked about Lampard’s future, the Iranian replied: “I can’t comment – it is not my decision.”
