The leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Sunday, issued warnings to the leading presidential candidates, Peter Obi of the Labour Party, Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party and Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress even as he warned Nigerians to expect crisis when a winner is announced. Primate Ayodele advised Obi to work more on the North and sensitize his followers about the collection of Permanent Voters Cards, PVCs because most youths may be disenfranchised. In a press statement issued by his Media Aide, Osho Oluwatosin, Primate Ayodele said: “Peter Obi still needs to work well in the Northern area, he should not be carried away by the crowd. He will gain the support of old politicians towards the election but some in the business world will work against him. “Majority of the youths clamouring for him will not come out to vote; he should still work very well on those that have PVC and can vote for him. Let him sensitize them well on the PVC, otherwise, not all the youths following him will vote for him.” He cautioned Atiku to be mindful of those he trusts. “Atiku will still be rocked by blackmailing. He must do [some] final touches so he won’t be disappointed by people he trusts so much. The Northern elders will support him for the election,” he prophesied. On Tinubu, Primate Ayodele said cabals in the current administration will be divided because of him, adding that his ambition will be resisted in the North, South East and South South. “The cabals will be divided because of Tinubu; there is still so much for him to do because his chances will be fought in the North, South Wast and South South. He should still work very hard. Emirs will give him support,” he said. Also, the clergyman said Nigerians should pray because there may be a crisis after the winner is announced.
