Manchester United boss, Erik ten Hag, has refused to make his opinion on Cristiano Ronaldo’s move to Al Nassr public. Ronaldo has completed his transfer to the Saudi Arabian team after his contract with United was torn up. The Red Devils have not missed the 37-year-old so far, with Marcus Rashford netting in a third consecutive game in a 1-0 victory over Wolves. “I don’t talk about the past, let’s talk about the future. “We made a good step today. First time we are in the top four, but it means nothing because it is a long way to go,” Ten Hag told reporters when asked about Ronaldo’s move. United now occupy fourth place on the log following their third successive win in the Premier League. They face Bournemouth next on January 3.
