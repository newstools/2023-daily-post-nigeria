Reno Omokri, a social media influencer has warned Nigerian students against voting for the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi whom he described as “stingy.” Omokri warned that Nigerian students should expect the mother of all strikes from the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, that would be frustrating if Obi is elected president. In a series of tweets, Omokri recounted that doctors were on strike for 13 months when Obi was the Governor of Anambra State. He wrote: “Nigeria’s 26 million registered student voters should note that a stingy man, like Peter Obi, will not pay ASUU well. If he is elected, expect strikes that will frustrate you. “You need a man, like Waziri Atiku Abubakar, who has promised to pay workers a living wage. “Students should note that under Peter Obi Anambra’s doctors were on strike for 13 months over low pay. “Google it! If the 26 million registered voters who are students vote for Obi, expect the mother of all ASUU strikes. Vote Atiku if you want to graduate in 4 years!”
