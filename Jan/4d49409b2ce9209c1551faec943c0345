The Police in Lagos has narrated the deadly clash with Yoruba Nation agitators at Ojota on Monday. There is palpable tension in and around the area after the demonstrators confronted security agents. A young man was lifeless in a photo posted on Twitter. Another is feared dead while others are injured. Police Public Relations Officer, SP Benjamin Hundeyin issued a statement on the bloody fracas. “Miscreants masquerading as Yoruba Nation Agitators” came out in their hundreds, disrupting social and commercial activities at Ojota”, the PRO noted. He said in response, officers from Alausa Division and the Raid Respond Squad (RRS) stepped in to disperse the unlawful gathering and prevent a breakdown of law and order. “The miscreants attacked the police, shooting, and destroying two vehicles in the process.  “One person has been confirmed dead, while two police officers shot by the miscreants are currently receiving treatment. Four suspects have been arrested and investigations have commenced.” Hundeyin vowed that the Lagos State Police Command would not allow any person or group of persons to disrupt the peace in Lagos. It is unclear if the deceased was hit by a stray bullet or targeted by security agents. “They shot teargas and guns at us. They have killed one person, this is Ojota”, a protester screamed in a video. One Toyota Hilux, reportedly driven by the police, was set on fire. There were also bonfires on the road.
