Guinea’s U-23 head coach, Morlaye Cisse, is banking on local players for the side’s 2023 Africa U-23 Cup of Nations qualifiers against Nigeria. The Junior Syli Stars have already commenced the second phase of their preparations for the encounter. The team defeated SOAR Academy in a friendly on Friday. Cisse currently has 21 players from the local league in camp for the game against the Olympic Eagles. “The objective is to have a solid base from Conakry with a team of 22 even 25 or 30 players and at any time we can rely on these players,” he told Africsport. “Since there is always a last-minute disappointment from foreign-based players and we have to avoid being surprised at the last minute by foreign players.” The first leg will take place at the Lekan Salami Stadium, Adamasingba, Ibadan, between March 20-28. The reserve fixture will take place in Conakry a week later. The overall winners will qualify for the U-23 AFCON which will be hosted by Morocco in November 2023.
