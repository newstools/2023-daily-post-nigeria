Manchester City playmaker, Kevin De Bruyne missed their training session on Tuesday ahead of Thursday’s Premier League clash with Tottenham. Pep Guardiola’s side are looking to bounce back after their 2-1 defeat to Manchester United last weekend. The result has left the champions eight points behind leaders Arsenal, who beat North London rivals Tottenham 2-0 on Sunday. City trained on Tuesday morning ahead of their match against Spurs, but De Bruyne was missing from the session. However, John Stones and Ruben Dias, who were absent during the derby defeat at Old Trafford, were part of the training.
