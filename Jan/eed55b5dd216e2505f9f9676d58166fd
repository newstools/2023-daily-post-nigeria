The Labour Party Gubernatorial candidate in Abia State, Dr Alex Otti, has expressed displeasure over the non-payment of backlogs of salary arrears owed civil servants in the state. Otti spoke at a recent meeting with some select church leaders at Amuda and Isuochi communities in Abia State, against the scathing remarks by a clergyman about the festering economic hardship his parishioners are undergoing due to non-payment of their salaries while campaign tours continue in the areas. He regretted that pastors and other leaders within the Christendom are now the ones who bear the brunt of what appears to be a deliberate policy of the Peoples Democratic Party to impoverish public servants in the state, especially teachers who are owed many months of salary arrears. His words: ” I can relate to what you have said because if you’re pastoring teachers and they have not been paid, how can they support themselves? So, what will happen is that Church leaders like you will be the ones supporting the teachers. “If a teacher comes to you today and says pastor, my family has not eaten; if it is just N500 you have in your pocket, you will give it to him. You are the one now paying tithes to him. So, that’s what it is”. The Abia Gubernatorial candidate of the Labour Party was flanked by his wife, running mate, Engr. Ikechukwu Emetu, and the coordinator of the State Campaign Council, Acho Obioma during the meeting with Christian leaders.
