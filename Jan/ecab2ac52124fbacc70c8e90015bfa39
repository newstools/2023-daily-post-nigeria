One person was reportedly killed and five others wounded with various degrees of injuries during a clash between the operatives of Zamfara State Anti-Thuggery Committee and hoodlums at a motor park in Gusau, the state capital. Addressing newsmen in his Gusau office, the chairman of the committee, Alhaji Muhammed Bello Bakyasuwa said his operatives of the committee acting on intelligence that one Dondus was attempting to kill somebody in the motor park had quickly mobilized to the scene but were attacked after the arrest of the main suspect. “The thugs came with dangerous weapons and attacked my men who retaliated and that led to the death of one of the thugs while five of them sustained various degrees of injuries,” he added. Speaking further, Bakyasuwa said that they arrested eight of the thugs, pointing out that five of the arrested suspects are being detained at the Zamfara State Police Command while three are in the custody of the committee. “Dondus has been a wanted criminal by the committee for supplying logistics including vehicles and dangerous drugs in the state,” he stated. Bakyasuwa who further alleged that Dondus had been selling dangerous drugs in the motor park and encouraging hoodlums to commit thuggery-related crimes in the motor park, stressed that the operatives of the committee have been working hard to get him arrested. While assuring that the suspects will be arraigned in court as soon as a thorough investigation is completed, he appealed to the public to remain law-abiding and abstain from drug abuse, stressing that the committee was not established for political reasons but to address thuggery-related crimes in the state.
