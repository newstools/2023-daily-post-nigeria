The Nigeria Police Force has paraded 11 suspected criminals over alleged crimes across Jigawa State. The state Commissioner of Police, CP Emmanuel Effiom Ekot, paraded the suspects on Wednesday at the command’s headquarters in Dutse. He said the suspects were arrested in December 2022 for kidnapping, armed robbery, drug peddling, and illegal possession of firearms. CP Effiom said the command has also succeeded in the recovery of exhibits and items, including one barrette rifle, seven rounds of cartridges, one fabricated revolver pistol, bows and arrows, 47 different ammunition, three empty magazines of different riffles, cutlass, iron and one Kasea motorcycle among others. He said the suspects were charged to court for prosecution. The commissioner, however, assured of the police’s readiness to continue to protect the lives and properties of residents. He called on the people of the state to continue cooperating with security agencies in fighting against crimes.
