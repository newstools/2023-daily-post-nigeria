Lagos Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has announced plans to implement measures to stop heavy-duty trucks from plying Ojuelegba Bridge. Sanwo-Olu gave the hint after Sunday’s fatal accident that left nine people dead after a container fell on a commercial bus. The governor, on behalf of the people and the state government, sympathised with the families of the victims. Commissioner for Transportation, Frederic Oladeinde, in a statement, said the injured persons were being treated in the hospital. His statement on Monday assured the accident would be thoroughly investigated to prevent a recurrence of such tragic incidents. “We are working with the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing to install Vehicle/Truck barriers on the inward and outward sections of the bridge,” he said. Oladeinde said the authorities share the grief of those who lost their loved ones and pray that the Almighty will strengthen them. The commissioner added that the government would continue to implement its Transport Master Plan, which has safety strategies for safer roads.
