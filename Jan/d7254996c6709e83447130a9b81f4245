With just one month to the presidential election, Pastor Paul Enenche of Dunamis International Gospel Centre, on Sunday cautioned Nigerians against voting for the wrong candidate. Enenche warned that God would judge Nigerians who vote for killers, sponsors of terrorists and jihadists in February. Speaking during the church’s combined service in Abuja, Enenche urged Nigerians to get their Permanent Voters Cards, PVCs, and vote for the right candidates. Enenche noted that the presidential election is no longer physical but spiritual. The clergyman warned that evil forces are out to destroy Nigeria, but God’s agenda would prevail. According to Enenche: “Call your family members and tell them, if they vote for killers, God will judge them. “I say again, if they vote for terrorists and their sponsors, Jihadists, God will judge them. “Because for some of them in the villages, they don’t know what is going on because they are not on social media. “Nigeria is at a junction where the forces of destruction want to tear it apart but I tell you that this nation shall fulfil the agenda of God. “Call your family members and tell them who to vote for, and how to vote. I am saying this because the matter of the election now is no longer physical, it has gone spiritual.” He warned that the destiny of Christians is at stake; hence Nigerians should keep quiet.
