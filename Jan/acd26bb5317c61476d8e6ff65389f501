Graham Potter has blamed Chelsea goalkeeper, Kepa Arrizabalaga for their defeat to Fulham in the Premier League on Thursday. The Blues have now been defeated six times out of their last eight games under the former Brighton boss. Thursday’s loss at Craven Cottage left them 10th in the Premier League and 10 points behind fourth place. Willian scored against his former club in the first half, but defender Kalidou Koulibaly levelled for the visitors shortly after the break. Joao Felix, who made his debut after finalising his £9 million loan move from Atletico Madrid and was their best player on the night, was then shown a red card in the 58th minute, while Carlos Vinicius gave the host the winner in the 73rd minute. Kepa, who was also blamed for Chelsea’s defeat to Manchester City last week, made another costly error on Thursday. During his post match interview, Potter was asked directly about Kepa’s involvement in Fulham’s winning goal, Potter said: “I think the goal itself was a frustrating one from our perspective. “It felt like a bit of a soft goal to concede and that’s something we have to do better with. “The manner of the goal is really disappointing and really frustrating.”
