The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC, in Imo State arrested 21 suspected human traffickers and five illegal migrants in 2022. The commandant of the corps in Imo, Matthew Ovye, disclosed this while presenting the command’s scorecard for 2022 at an expanded management meeting of the command held in its headquarters in Owerri, the state capital. Ovye said that the suspected traffickers were promptly handed over to the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons, NAPTIP, while the illegal migrants were duly handed over to the authorities of the Nigeria Immigration Service in Imo. He commended the command’s men and officers for their dedication to duty in the year under review and charged them to remain professional and proactive in the discharge of their constitutional duties. “As the general elections approach, may I inform you that there will be no room for bribery and corruption and we will not condone compromise of any kind on the part of officers and men,” he said. He, however, assured Imo residents of the command’s commitment to their safety while warning criminally minded persons to desist from crime or be ready to face the full wrath of the law when apprehended. He pledged the Command’s unflinching commitment to the fight against vandalism, human trafficking, illegal migration, and destruction of critical national assets and infrastructure such as electricity and telecommunication installations. In response, Emmanuel Nweze, the deputy commandant, who spoke on behalf of the officers, thanked the commandant for his steadfastness and fatherly disposition and reassured him of their readiness to fully cooperate with him.
