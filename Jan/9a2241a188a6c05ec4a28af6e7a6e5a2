The Presidential Candidate of the Social Democratic Party, SDP, Prince Adebayo Adewole, says the ruling All Progressive Congress, has succeeded in playing a comedy show in the last eight years of their governance and plunged the nation into a more devastating state. Adebayo Adewole who was in Kano to inaugurate the state’s gubernatorial candidate and other electives position’s on Tuesday, told newsmen that the APC has not only failed woefully but Succeeded in creating a poverty line among the Citizens. “Because of these glaring failures what the government will do now is to create a Comedy Show and throw a Brazzers towards the election but people are not getting it, that is why we don’t have problems with what they are doing”. He said, “for a Family in Nigeria or Kano whose idea of their survival is prayers or miracles, and the miracles come in form of going round to search for a dustbin to get watermelon to boil, such a family does not deserve that kind of treatment and such cannot say the so-called N5000 they were given would remove their malice”. Prince Adewole said the party is reaching out to Nigerians, hoping that the structure already in place will grow to understand the citizen. On the threat of possible shift or total cancellations of the 2023 general elections as reported by INEC, Adewole, said the election umpire has no excuse but to ensure that the polls are conducted as scheduled. “INEC is the most funded entity of the government and today they are even competing with some states in terms of financial strength, so they have no excuse whatsoever but to make the election a huge reality.
