As the crisis within the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, lingers on, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has slammed the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. Wike cautioned that those issuing such threats in Abuja should rethink else they will have problems. The governor made the remark while noting that the state cannot continue to be a dumping ground. The governor disclosed this at the flag-off of construction work on the Elele Internal Roads in Ikwerre Local Government Area on Monday. The governor said Rivers State stands very strong in the scheme of national affairs, which is why it is given that when the state gives anybody support, it should be reciprocated. He noted that despite the contribution of Rivers State to PDP, the state has nothing to show for it. “Let me use this opportunity to tell you. People should understand. Rivers State is very strong as far as this country is concerned. “I have told people. Rivers State is not a dumping ground and will never be a dumping ground. If we give you support, we believe you can reciprocate, so nobody should threaten us, no political party can threaten Rivers State, not one. “So all those who are opening their mouth in Abuja to threaten Rivers State, think twice before you have a problem,” Wike said
