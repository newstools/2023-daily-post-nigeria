Pastor Enoch Adeboye of The Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, has recounted his encounter with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, after he bought a private. Adeboye said EFCC officials came after him following the purchase of a private jet. Addressing his members at the church’s headquarters, Adeboye said he returned to God for a solution after EFCC decided to probe him following the purchase of the private jet. He said the purchase of the private jet bought about a lot of noise and criticism from people. According to Adeboye: “They sent EFCC to come and probe me, “Where did he get the money to buy a jet?” etc. The noise was much. “I was flying because I didn’t buy a jet for pleasure, the work has expanded to the level that there is no way I can do it by commercial travelling.” On what he did, Adeboye said: “Father, what do I do now? And God answered, saying ‘Don’t answer them, I have you surrounded.'”
