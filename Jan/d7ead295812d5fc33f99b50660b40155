Besiktas have insisted there is no termination clause in Wout Weghorst’s contract. The Turkish club confirmed this in a statement on Monday. United are waiting to see if Burnley can reach an agreement with Besiktas to cut short Weghorst’s loan. It is believed the player is desperate to join United this month. But Besiktas sporting director, Ceyhun Kazanci has made it clear a deal will only happen if the club is compensated. Otherwise, the club is ready to make Weghorst see out his season-long loan. “The claim that there is an exit clause in our player’s contract, stating that his contract can be terminated with a compensation of 2.5m euros (£2.2m) in case of an offer from the Premier League, is fictitious. “The news that the player in question will leave the team on Tuesday is completely untrue. The initiative regarding Wout Weghorst belongs entirely to Besiktas,” a statement from Besiktas read.
