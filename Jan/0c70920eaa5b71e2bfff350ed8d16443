Prophet Peter Williams says Nigeria will lose some pastors and influential traditional rulers in 2023. The cleric gave his prophecies for the New Year in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). The Founder of Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) said power-drunk nations and individuals would fail this year. Williams warned of ‘Nigerian military shaking’, adding that a lot of covered secrets will be exposed by God, The prophet said those to be affected include men of God, politicians and the elite. “God said some important kings and men of God should prepare their will because nothing can stop their passage. “There will be enthronement and dethronement in high places both spiritual and physical.” Williams predicted “a shaking in the Nigerian military that will be likened to a mutiny”, but not a full-fledged coup. He prophesied God raising Generals in His vineyard “and this time around young men”. The religious leader also revealed his vision of “noise and global confusion”.
