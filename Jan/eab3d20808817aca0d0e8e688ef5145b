Presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi, has charged Nigerians to rescue the nation through the 2023 election. In his New Year message, Obi declared 2023 a very critical year that will determine the country’s next direction. The Labour Party flagbearer charged citizens to take back Nigeria “from the cold hands of corruption, insecurity and unproductivity.” Obi said the nation could not continue in its retrogressive movement in the coming years. The former Anambra governor warned that the current state could result in total collapse. He said in 2023, the people must “unite against the continued abuse of our democracy and economy.” “The power is in our hands to take back our nation, in 2023, and make it work,” he said while restating his commitment to security, unification and moving Nigeria from consumption to production. The LP candidate further promised to actualize the pact he made with the electorate. “Nigerians can hold me accountable by my words of promise,” the statement added. Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has declared his support for the businessman-cum-politician.
