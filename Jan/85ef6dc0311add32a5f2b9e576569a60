Ahead of the forthcoming presidential election, the Chief Whip of the Senate, Orji Kalu has claimed the presidential candidates of the New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, and the Labour, LP, Rabiu Kwankwaso and Peter Obi, respectively, are indirectly “working” for the victory of the All Progressives Congress, APC, flagbearer, Bola Tinubu, by dividing southern votes. Kalu stated this while featuring on the Channels Television’s Political Paradigm programme aired on Tuesday. He said the voting base of the APC in the North-West and North-East geopolitical zones remains intact. The APC chieftain also said he does not believe in pre-election polls, which have put Obi ahead of the 18 presidential candidates, including Tinubu. “I don’t believe in the poll; the poll is not realistic,” Kalu said. “If the poll wants to be realistic, Kwankwaso and Peter Obi are working for us because nobody has touched our base; nobody has touched the strongest base of APC. The North-West and the North-East are our bases. “But come to the South-East, it is divided, come to the South-South, it is divided, it is finished with Obidients. Nobody has touched our base; our base is still intact; it is as good as anything,” he said.
