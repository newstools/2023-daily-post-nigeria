Fire has gutted some sections of a popular Potiskum market in Yobe State. The inferno was said to have started on Sunday at about 8 pm. Although no life was lost, the fire destroyed property worth millions of Naira at the sections of second-hand clothing, yam and bicycle as well as Point of Sales (POS) shops of the market. There are no clues to the actual cause of the incident as of the time of filing this report, as the market reportedly had no electricity supply at the time of the incident. It was gathered that the fire was put out by good Samaritans due to the alleged non-response from the fire service in Potiskum and neighbouring stations. Officials of the Yobe State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), had earlier this morning visited the scene to commiserate and assess the level of damage with a view to providing necessary assistance to victims of the disaster. Fire incidents have been a reoccurring phenomenon in the market, leading to the wanton destruction of property.
