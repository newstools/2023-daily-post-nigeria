The face-off between Governor Darius Dickson Ishaku of Taraba and the House Committee Chairman on Internal Security, Danjuma Usman Shiddi, has taken a different dimension. This was demonstrated on Thursday when Shiddi described Ishaku’s administration as “anti-culture, primordial and shocking”. The lawmaker from Taraba State who is representing Wukari/Ibi, made the outburst while reacting to the alleged arrest and detention of perceived supporters of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in the state. In a statement he personally signed and made available to journalists in Jalingo, Shiddi said Ishaku’s administration, reminds Tarabans of “the indignity, spineless corruption, rot, destruction of the sacrosanct reputation of the state by his administration and other traumatic experiences the Taraba government under the PDP has subjected Tarabans to in the last seven years.” He alleged that Ishaku’s misrule has destroyed almost every valuable fabric of the society, saying the ”state judiciary particularly the lower courts which should be the bastion of the common man, is also, unfortunately, being subjugated to the whims and caprices of Ishaku and his cohorts and being ridiculed in this manner. ” “It is our considered opinion that Governor Darius Ishaku is only an outstanding beneficiary of this decomposing state mechanism.” “We are worried about governor Ishaku and his cohorts’ several other obvious gross misconducts and nasty violations of not only the sacred norms of the Nigerian constitution but also the agelong values of peace, unity and respect for human rights held in the highest esteem by Taraba people.” The member claimed to have “observed the continuous arrests, hounding and harassment of APC members in the most barbaric and condemnable manner even when they are on bail. He urged APC faithful to keep hope alive and not take laws into their hands. insisting there is a need for the party members to refuse intimidation
