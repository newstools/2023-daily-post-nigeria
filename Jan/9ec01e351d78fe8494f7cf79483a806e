Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in Lagos, Abdul-Azeez Adediran (Jandor) said the 2023 election will usher the party into government. Adediran, other party leaders and candidates visited Agege Local Government Area on Friday in continuation of his tour of 245 wards. Jandor had an interactive session with the Tipper Drivers and Building Materials Dealers Association at Tipper Garage in Agege. The flagbearer advised the people to vote for candidates they interact with, not those they see only on posters. “Vote for candidates that visit you where you live and work to see the condition. Vote for someone who has come to your doorstep to hear your challenges”, he said. He said Lagos deserves a populist government, vowing to end harassment on the roads and markets by law enforcement agencies. The candidate also decried the bad condition of roads in some areas despite enormous resources. Jandor added that politicians must invest in people rather than multiplying personal property for selfish reasons. He vowed to prioritise the citizens’ welfare and lead with the fear of God hence the visits to every nook and cranny of the state. “That is why ours is different. Relax. The time of PDP has come,” Adeniran declared.
