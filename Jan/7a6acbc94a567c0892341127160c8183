National and State Assembly candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Ekiti State, on Tuesday, raised concern over the composition of the party’s Presidential Campaign Council in the State. The candidates for the coming elections who met in Ado Ekiti, called for the dissolution of the campaign council, saying as stakeholders in the State, their input is necessary in the campaign council. The meeting was attended by seven out of the nine National Assembly candidates and 20 out of the 26 State House of Assembly candidates . In a letter titled, “Ekiti: Before it is too late,” issued to the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, the candidates lamented that the candidates of the Social Democratic Party, SDP, have taken over their roles in the presidential campaign council. The letter reads in part, “Part of the candidates of the SDP are also in close alliance with the All Progressives Congress, APC with a view to also getting funds and dividing PDP votes so they can ensure victory for the APC National Assembly candidates. “The implication of the SDP getting funds for the elections of its candidates from both PDP and APC is that our chances in our own elections will be in jeopardy. “Therefore, it will interest Your Excellency to know that we, the candidates in Ekiti, are not working with the Presidential Campaign Council. “We are doing our own things, putting our destinies in our own hands because we know very well that the majority of those in the Campaign Council are only interested in election resources not the victory. “Consequently, we are demanding that this campaign council be dissolved forthwith to allow our input as the key stakeholders, to save the current situation in the State.”
