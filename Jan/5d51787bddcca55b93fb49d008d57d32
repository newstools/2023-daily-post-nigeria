Yobe State Emergency Management Agency, (SEMA), says three children have been reported dead in a fire incident which occurred in Nguru town, Yobe State. The agency disclosed this in a post via its official Facebook page on Thursday. The State Humanitarian Agency noted that it has also received reports of fire incidents in Damaturu and Fune local government areas between 28th, 30th December, 2022 and 4th January, 2023 respectively. According to SEMA, an assessment revealed loss of property, including household items; reserved food items, personal belongings, residential apartments, among others. As harmattan season sets in, the agency cautioned people in the State against the use of fire, as well as other electrical appliances. “SEMA wishes to use this medium to call on community leaders and heads of households to be cautious during this season, by ensuring that all electric appliances are switched off when not in use, firewoods are properly extinguished after use and that bush burning is carefully monitored”, it warned. The agency, however, said it is mobilising resources for immediate support to cushion the hardships of victims in the affected communities.
