President Muhammadu Buhari has commiserated with the government and people of Kebbi State over the loss of lives following the capsizing of a boat conveying farmers. In a condolence message issued by his spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, on Friday in Abuja, Buhari condoled families who lost loved ones in the accident. He urged more prayers for the rescued persons that are still undergoing medical examinations and treatment. Buhari commended the efforts of rescue workers who worked for days searching for the missing persons. He, however, called on stakeholders to pay more attention to proper regulation of transportation by boats, especially in rural areas. President Buhari, as reported by NAN, prayed that the Almighty God would receive the souls of the departed.
