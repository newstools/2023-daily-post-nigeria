On Wednesday, the Appeal Court ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to reconfigure the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System, BVAS, it used for the presidential election on February 25. The proceeding was led by Justice Joseph Ikyegh, who submitted that stopping INEC from configuring BVAS would affect the conduct of governorship and House of Assemblies elections scheduled for Saturday, March 11. Sam Hart, the Senior Special Assistant on Public Communication to the Abia state Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, has tried to explain the court’s ruling. “Today’s Judgments summarized. “Win-Win for both INEC & LP. Both requests granted. “INEC assures Court that BVAS reconfiguration will not wipe data as they are saved in server back end. “Judgment: LP – Inspect records “INEC – Reconfigure BVAS for March 11,” Hart tweeted.
