The All Progressives Congress, APC, governorship candidate in Plateau State, Nentawe Yilwatda has said he would defeat the Labour Party and the Peoples Democratic Party. Yilwatda disclosed this on Wednesday in a Channels Television interview. Speaking ahead of the March 11 governorship election, the former Resident Electoral Commissioner for Benue State, dismissed claims that the Independent National Electoral Commission would compromise the polls in his favour. “We are succeeding already. According to statewide spread and distribution, we will win the Governorship election in Plateau state. “I have worked in Rivers State, Anambra and Benue; nobody has questioned my credibility. INEC staff are professionals and cannot compromise the polls for anybody”, he said. Yilwatda is the anointed candidate of the incumbent Governor, Simon Lalong of the APC. Other contenders for the Plateau governorship are Patrick Dakum of LP and Caleb Mutfwang of the PDP.
