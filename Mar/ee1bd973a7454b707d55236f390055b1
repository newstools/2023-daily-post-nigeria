Three persons have been reported dead in an accident that happened in Ogun State on Friday. The road crash also injured three persons, while the remaining two persons of the eight passengers involved were rescued unhurt. DAILY POST reports that the crash occurred at 7:10 am on Friday at a U-turn close to Total Petrol Station. “A total of eight persons were involved, all male adults; three persons sustained various degrees of injuries, two were unhurt and unfortunately, three persons were recorded killed,” the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) told DAILY POST correspondent. According to FRSC spokesperson in Ogun State, Florence Okpe, the crash involved three vehicles―a Toyota Hiace bus with registration number MNA48Z, a Man Diesel truck registered with number ABC682ZW and a Daf Truck marked T- 3756LA. Okpe attributed the crash to overspeeding, which she said led to a loss of control on the part of the truck driver, who reportedly rammed into the Julius Berger truck while he was about to make a U-turn, before the Toyota bus’s head-on collision. The injured victims, Okpe said, were taken to Victory Hospital in Ogere for medical attention, while the corpses were deposited at FOS Morgue Ipara. The Sector Commander of the FRSC in Ogun, Ahmed Umar, while commiserating with the family of the crash victims, pleaded with the motoring public to always drive defensively by anticipating the action of other drivers and observing road signs.
