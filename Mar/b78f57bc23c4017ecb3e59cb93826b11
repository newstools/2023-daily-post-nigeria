The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has confirmed Ladi Adebutu as the authentic governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State. INEC declared Adebutu the rightful candidate, having won all the cases against his candidature at the Supreme Court. Earlier, the Senior Special Assistant to Governor Dapo Abiodun on New Media, Emmanuel Ojo, had claimed the PDP had no governorship candidate in Ogun State. Ojo, on different social media platforms, said: ”Ogun PDP does not have a governorship candidate according to INEC list. Don’t waste your vote when it is time. Vote for APC.” But, the INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner in Ogun State, Niyi Ijalaye, dismissed Ojo’s claim, describing it as unfounded and untrue. “It is a rumour that is not founded, that is all,” Ijalaye said. He maintained that Adebutu would participate in the March 18 poll as the PDP gubernatorial candidate in Ogun State. Recall that Adebutu and another of his rivals, Segun Showunmi, have reunited to work together for the PDP in the coming election. DAILY POST learnt that the last case filed by Jimi Lawal at the Supreme Court was on Thursday dismissed by the court. Lawal and some of his followers were said to have defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC).
