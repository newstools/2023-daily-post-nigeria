The National Council of Traditional Rulers of Nigeria has written to President-elect, Bola Tinubu after his electoral triumph. The body reminded the former Lagos governor to deliver the promises made during his campaign. Chairman Coordinating Committee and Etsu Nupe, Alhaji Yahaya Abubakar signed the message to Tinubu on Friday. The custodians of traditional institutions welcomed the President-elect’s commitment to serving Nigeria and Nigerians. They prayed God would give Tinubu and his Vice President-elect “the wisdom and courage to deliver on their promises and mandate”. The council is co-led by Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III, Sultan of Sokoto, and Co-chair, and HRH Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi-Ojaja II, Ooni of Ife. The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, on Wednesday declared Tinubu the winner of the February 25 election. The first and second runners-up Atiku Abubakar, PDP, and Peter Obi, LP, are challenging the outcome of the election over irregularities recorded in some states.
