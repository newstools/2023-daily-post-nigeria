A group under the auspices of Elites for Good Governance, EGG, today urged Deltans to support and cast their votes for only the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Sheriff Oborevwori, in the forthcoming 2023 gubernatorial election in Delta State. The group said the Labour Party governorship candidate, Deacon Ken Pela has never helped his family member and has been living in Lagos until he decide to come to Delta State to manipulate the anger of the masses to get what he did not work for and cannot even have the ability to control. The group also lambasted the Deputy President of the Senate, Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege saying he abandoned those who went with him to the Red Chamber to remove the mace to wallow in poverty. EGG National President, Comrade Ogie Samson made the call in a statement signed and made available to newsmen six days before the gubernatorial election. The group said the people should guard against the tricks and treachery of some of the governorship candidates. According to the group: “Before anyone should think of working for or voting for any governorship candidates, we should look at the socio-political abilities of such a person because that is the only way the masses can benefit.” The group claimed everyone who accompanied Deputy President of the Senate Ovie Omo-Agege to allegedly remove the mace from the Red Chamber has not been empowered to date. “After the election, his brothers ensured they get all contracts to themselves, without thinking of those who worked for him, but now that election is close, he has started distributing transformers and foodstuffs to deceive people,” the statement alleged. EGG further noted that Sheriff Oborevwori has been a grassroots politician who is united with the masses, stressing that he is always easily accessible.
