The Ohanaeze Ndigbo socio-political organization has cautioned the President-elect, Bola Tinubu against victimizing the Igbos who did not vote him during the just concluded presidential election. Ohanaeze also urged Tinubu not to victimize other sections of the country that did not vote him during the election. In a statement signed by his Secretary-General, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, Ohanaeze urged Tinubu to consider Igbos in the distribution of amenities. According to Isiguzoro: “Ndigbo urges the President-Elect not to victimize any section of the country who voted against him but as the new Political leader of the Country, he should ensure that Nigerians, especially Ndigbo are accommodated in the distribution of public amenities and provide an enabling environment for businesses to thrive in the country.” Ohanaeze further retracted its earlier stance on the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. The body stressed that Igbos in the state should vote their conscience in the March 11th governorship elections. Ohanaeze asked the governor to provide adequate security across all markets in Lagos State.
