Flying Eagle’s Solomon Agbalaka and Ibrahim Muhammad’s goals have been picked by the Confederation of African Football, CAF, among the top five goals scored in the group stage of the 2023 Africa U-20 Cup of Nations. Agbalaka scored from a wonderful header in the Flying Eagles’ 1-0 win against hosts Egypt last week. The left-back was also included the Best XI of the group stage. The goal against Egypt was Flying Eagles first in the competition. Muhammadus blistering strike came in Flying Eagles’ 2-0 win against Mozambique. The forward fired home a rasping shot from outside the box. The superb strike will certainly be in the mention for the Goal of the Tournament.
