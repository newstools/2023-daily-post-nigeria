The Interim Management Committee (IMC) has lifted the ban on Shooting Stars media officer, Tosin Omojola. Omojola was suspended for one year in June 2022 for his comments after the Oluyole Warriors matchday 31 encounter against South West rivals, Remo Stars in Ibadan. The IMC stated that Omojola was pardoned following his recent apology and appeal for leniency. The IMC said the lifting of the ban takes immediate effect. The league body warned the media officer to uphold the strictest standard of professionalism going forward. Omojola is expected to start his duties when the Nigeria Premier Football League resumes later this month.
