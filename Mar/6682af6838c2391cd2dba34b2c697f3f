The Alara of Ilara Mokin, Oba Abiodun Adefehinti, referred to the situation as disturbing and urged the state government to act quickly. According to the monarch, some indigenes whose houses were badly damaged had been sleeping in open spaces. “More than 100 houses are affected and the number of people who slept outside during these past nights would be close to 200 or more than that. “Some of them have taken time to repair those that were not terribly damaged. “We know the government has a lot of things to do, however, we are appealing to them that we need their assistance.” On his part, the Commissioner for Energy, Mines and Natural Resources, Razaq Obe, said the damage caused by the rainstorm was unprecedented.
