The Olympic Eagles will now host Guinea in the first leg of their 2023 Africa U-23 Cup of Nations qualifying fixture at the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja. The game was initially fixed for the Lekan Salami Stadium, Adamasingba, Ibadan. The ground hosted the previous encounter between the Olympic Eagles and Tanzania. However, the poor state of the playing surface has necessitated a change of venue. The final round qualifying contest is slated for Wednesday, March 22. The reverse fixture will be played in Morocco on Monday, March 27. The overall winners over two legs will qualify for the 2023 U-23 AFCON to be staged in Morocco in November.
