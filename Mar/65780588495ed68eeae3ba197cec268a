The Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate in the February 25 presidential election, Peter Obi, has urged his supporters not to turn the court to a rally ground. DAILY POST reports that Obi would be physically present in the Appeal Court today for the hearing on the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, application seeking to set aside earlier order granted to both Obi and Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to inspect the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System, BVAS, machines. Obi and Atiku had sought and obtained the order of the Court to inspect INEC materials used during the presidential election. However, the INEC is asking the court to set the order aside as it may affect the conduct of the gubernatorial election on Saturday. Meanwhile, Obi wants his supporters not to flood the Court premises to enable his legal team the space and peaceful environment to carry out their duties. “As we go about seeking redress for our stolen mandate, I plead with OBIdients to respect the sanctity of the Court premises and give our legal team the space and peaceful environment to carry out their duties. “The Court Premises is not and should not be turned into a rally ground. I urge the Obidients to go about their businesses peacefully,” he tweeted.
