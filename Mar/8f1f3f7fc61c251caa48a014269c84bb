Former Premier League goalkeeper, Ben Foster, has heaped praises on Chelsea’s record signing Enzo Fernandez. Foster said Fernandez means business, adding that the midfielder works hard for Chelsea. Fernandez arrived at Stamford Bridge from Benfica last month for £106.8 million. “Enzo Fernandez, I like the way he’s settled in already. He looks like he means business. He looks like he wants to do it properly, run around, and work hard,” Fernandez said on his The Cycling GK podcast. “You can immediately tell that the World Cup winner has the bite and aggression that supporters love.”
