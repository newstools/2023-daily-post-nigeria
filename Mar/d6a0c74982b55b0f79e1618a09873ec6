A police Sergeant has died inside the residence of the former Commissioner of Police in Ogun State, Lanre Bankole. The deceased police officer, who was identified as Sgt Gbenga Onakomaya, died Saturday at Bankole’s house located at Kemta Housing Estate, Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. DAILY POST reliably gathered that the cop, who was on guard duty at the former Commissioner of Police’s house, slept but could not wake up in the morning. He was reportedly rushed to the Federal Medical Centre, Abeokuta, where he was pronounced dead by the doctor on duty. An internal source told our correspondent on Monday that the body of Sgt Onakomaya had been deposited at the mortuary of the FMC. “The family has been contacted and an autopsy will be carried out to confirm the real cause of the death,” the source stated. The Ogun State police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, has confirmed the incident, saying anybody can die in his sleep. Asked about the incident, Oyeyemi said: “How does that concern you? It doesn’t concern you. A police officer went on duty, he slept and he couldn’t wake up in the morning. “It is a case of sudden and unnatural death. It is not something that is beyond the ordinary. It is not something that has not happened before. Anybody can be sick and die anywhere, even in your house, you can be sick and… somebody can be sick and can die anywhere. Or did they tell you that any other thing happened to him aside from that?” Bankole was transferred from the Ogun State police command and was replaced by former Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, barely a month ago. The Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, had deployed Bankole to head the Force Criminal Investigations Department (FCID) X-Squad at its Annex in Lagos State.
