Former Premier League defender, Rio Ferdinand has slammed Leicester City supporters for being disrespectful to a player like Ben Chilwell, who gave his all to the club before joining Chelsea. Ferdinand backed the England international left-back after the Chelsea star goaded Leicester fans with his goal celebration. Chilwell, a former Leicester star, left the King Power Stadium for Stamford Bridge in 2020 in a deal worth £45million. He became his former fans’ target on Saturday when he filed out against his former club at the King Power Stadium. He scored Chelsea’s first goal after 11 minutes and celebrated by sliding in front of the home support with his ears cupped, giving it back to the home supporters who had given him a frosty reception back at his old club. Kai Havertz and Mateo Kovacic were the other scorers for the west London Blues in the 3-1 victory. “They booed him!” Ferdinand told Five. “They got 50-odd million for this kid, a left-back right, out of Covid, and they are [still] booing him. “He did a great job there, and they are booing him for going to Chelsea. “It doesn’t make sense. So good, I’m glad he did that[celebrated in front of the fans], gave them a bit back, they deserved it. They should respect him.” Normally, players would not want to celebrate when they manage to score against their old clubs but that was not the case with Ben Chiwell and the England defender would not be blamed for deciding to do otherwise.
