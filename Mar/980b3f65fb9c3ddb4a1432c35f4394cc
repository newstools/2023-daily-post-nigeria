The Bayelsa State Coordinator of the Tinubu-Shettima Campaign Council (ICC) has hailed the election that produced the All Progressives Congress (APC) Candidate, Ahmed Bola Tinubu, as the President-elect describing it as free, fair and credible. The Coordinator, Preye Aganaba, said no election in the history of the country threw up the kind of upset that came with the 2023 poll, which produced Tinubu. Aganaba, in a statement sent to DAILY POST, on Wednesday said in his community in Odi, Kolokuma-Opokuma, the local government area of the Bayelsa incumbent Governor, Senator Douye Diri, he delivered Tinubu against all odds. Aganaba said the people of his community, who followed the gospel of Tinubu preached by the ICC rejected the governor’s candidate, Atiku Abubakar and identified with Tinubu. He said: “Apart from winning my polling unit with 60 votes against the PDP’s 45 votes in the presidential election, we defeated Atiku in Ward three, Odi as Tinubu polled 547 votes against Atiku’s 535 votes. “The people believed in the gospel of Tinubu, and stood their ground against the array of PDP political leaders in my community. The Jagaban was a movement and our people joined the winning train”. Aganaba congratulated Tinubu on his well-deserved victory describing it as the acceptance of the people’s will. He said: “The 2023 elections is a true reflection of the people’s desire for a more prosperous Nigeria. Nigerians spoke with a strong voice and changed the face of politics forever. “I thank the people of my community, Odi for coming out en masse and voting massively for Tinubu. What we witnessed is a free and fair election. I congratulate the incoming President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his victory. “As Nigerians, we look forward to enhanced security, sustained democracy, social development and economic prosperity.”
