As reactions continue to trail this year’s International Women’s Day, IWD, marked every 8 March, a group known as the Centre for Public Policy and Research says most African women are mainly caregivers, calling for a change in the narrative. DAILY POST reports that this is contained in a statement by the Centre’s Chairman, Dr Sam Amadi. The Centre explained that such digital skills for women and girls would drive sustainable economic development and inclusive well-being for all. It advocated for more women in the technology and innovation sector to boost participation. The group added that innovative online content should be developed to address gender challenges in Nigeria and Africa. “Women innovators have continued to grow, particularly in technologically advanced countries; however, on a global scale, only 15% of innovators are women. Women are the primary caregivers in Africa, with 75% of these women living in rural communities. “Most of these women are responsible for their families’ energy, food, shelter, and clothing. As climatic conditions change, women are developing local strategies to mitigate and adapt to these changes. With an increase in local climate mitigation and adaptation strategies, there is an increase in female participation in climate action in Nigeria. “Online content should be developed to solve gender challenges specifically for women and girls that will promote human rights of women and girls in Nigeria”, the statement contained.
