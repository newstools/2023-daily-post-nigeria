Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola has urged leaders of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Lagos State to work for Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s reelection. The politician chaired a meeting in Ikeja attended by stakeholders, artisans, Igbo community and high level players in Alimosho politics. Aregbesola, according to a statement by spokesperson Sola Fasure, urged them to embark on door-to-door campaigns to ensure victory. The former Osun governor said a win for Sanwo-Olu would attract more development when President-elect Bola Tinubu is sworn in. The minister urged them to put all grievances behind and work in unison for the success of the party at the polls. “We cannot allow those who have not been with us since the days of the struggle from SDP, AD, AC, ACN and now APC to take what belongs to us. “We worked tirelessly for the success of what we have today in Lagos,” he added. Aregbesola charged members to shun “those fanning the embers of discord” in an attempt to derail the party
