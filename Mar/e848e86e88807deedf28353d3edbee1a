Shooting Stars head coach, Gbenga Ogunbote has revealed he is looking to make more quality additions to his team. The Oluyole Warriors struggled to make much impact during the first half of the campaign. The Ibadan club garnered nine points from nine matches during the first part of its campaign. Shooting Stars are currently battling to avoid relegation from the Nigeria Premier Football League. “Maybe we should get one or two quality players to tighten up and enhance our performance,” Ogunbote told reporters “We are looking between three to five players to block the loopholes.” Shooting Stars will face Akwa United when action resume in the NPFL on March 25.
