A 22-year-old tailor in Adamawa State, Muhammed Bala, has been arrested by the Police for allegedly stabbing a rival to death. Muhammed who hails from Mararaba in Madagali LGA allegedly killed his rival in the neighbourhood, identified simply as Bakura, during a quarrel over a girlfriend that they were allegedly sharing. Muhammed was reported to have caused the death of Bakura in the brawl which occurred on February 15, at the compound of the 17-year-old girl who is identified as Maryam Mohammed. Muhammed admitted stabbing Bakura by the neck over the teenager who he said he had proposed to marry after dating her for three years. According to the Police, Bakura himself had insisted that the teenage girl was his and had warned Muhammed to keep away from her. The stage was thus set when they both met at the girlâ€™s place on the fateful February 15 and began the fight when Muhammed allegedly used a knife in his possession to stab Bakura who slumped and died instantly. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in Adamawa State, SP Suleiman Nguroje, who confirmed the incident on Tuesday, assured that the suspect will be charged to court for prosecution.
