Former Liverpool star Michael Owen has revealed why the Reds thrashed Manchester United 7-0 in the Premier League at Anfield on Sunday. The Red Devils were condemned to their heaviest defeat in 92 years by Liverpool with 2 goals each from Mo Salah, Cody Gakpo and Darwin Nunez and one from Roberto Firmino. Manchester United came into Sunday’s clash flying very high and winning the Carabao last weekend. Owen, who played for both Liverpool and Manchester United during his playing days, noted that Jurgen Klopp’s side made use of every opportunity presented to them. “They were rootless. They scored virtually every chance in that second half. They were pretty rootless with whatever they were given. Gakpo.was rootless, Mo Salah breaking the record. You almost need to see it to believe it. It was stunning,” he said on Premier League Productions “And this is the Manchester United that came into the game with everybody raving about them that they were flying high in all four competitions and won one competition, maybe an outside chance of winning the Premier League. They were coming here flying high and the question was Liverpool’s name.”
