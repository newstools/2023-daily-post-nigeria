Former presidential aide and social media influencer, Reno Omokri has said despite Peter Obi of Labour Party patronage in the Nigerian Christendom, he could not get the national spread needed to win the just concluded presidential election. Omokri, a known supporter of Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, made this known via his official Twitter handle on Sunday. He was reacting to the fallout of the presidential election where the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, declared Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the All Progressives Party the winner and returned elected president. “Despite jumping from church to church, Obi could get neither the numbers nor the spread needed to win. It is even with three strong Muslims dividing the Muslim vote on the same ballot. Obi just demystified the Christian bloc vote. Oya, insult me”, he tweeted. Omokri has been critical of politicians not under his political party, PDP.
