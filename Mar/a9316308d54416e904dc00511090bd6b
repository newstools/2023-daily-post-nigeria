The CAF Confederation Cup matchday four encounter between Rivers United and Daring Club Motema Pembe have been put off following the non arrival of the Congolese. The encounter was scheduled to take place at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium, Uyo this evening. CAF is now expected to make a decision on the game soon after the Congolese failed to honour the game. The continent’s football governing body is expected to award three goals and three points to Rivers United. The Nigerian champions defeated Motema Pembe 1-0 in the first leg two weeks ago in Luanda. Stanley Eguma’s side top Group B with six points from three games.
