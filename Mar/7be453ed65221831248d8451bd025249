On Thursday, President Muhammadu Buhari commissioned a 50MW gas-electricity plant in Borno State to the cheer of residents. Residents of Maiduguri, who spoke to the media, disclosed they were happy as the electricity project would guarantee a steady power supply in the state and environs. According to the News Agency of Nigeria, Usman Ibrahim, a resident, said, “The project would remain memorable for the people who for several years our power supply has been inadequate due to activities of vandals, particularly insurgents.” “The electricity project will restore the glory of Maiduguri as the major business hub in the Northeast,” Sani Abubakar, Maiduguri trader, disclosed. Borno state, especially Maiduguri, has been a stronghold of a terrorist group, Boko Haram, for years, not until the Nigerian Military’s intervention.
