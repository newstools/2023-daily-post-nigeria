Nigeria’s former ambassador to the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, Alhaji Hassan Jika Ardo, has alleged that the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, is plotting to destabilize the forthcoming governorship and state House of Assembly elections in Taraba State. Ardo, who is a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, said the plans to scuttle the election in the state by using Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, officials and security agencies to rig, have been uncovered. He said this on Sunday during an interactive session with media men in Jalingo, the state capital, urging the electorate to tread extra legitimate miles to halt the plans from seeing the light of day. Ardo, who doubled as the State Coordinator of the Independent Grassroot Presidential Campaign Council, IGPCC, of President-elect Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, insisted that extensive interaction with people at the grassroots and other relevant stakeholders shows that the PDP is jittery due to the outcome of the Presidential election. The PDP, who according to him, is piqued by the general acceptance of the APC in the state, has resolved to use other means to win the election at all costs. “The scheme is to ensure that election materials arrive very late especially in the hinterlands so that the election will run into the night when they will perform their devilish acts. Another tactics is to make sure that certain sensitive materials do not come to the polling units at all or they will bring fake results sheets and create confusion,” he alleged. He admonished the electorates not to take the law into their hands but to protect their votes at all costs in line with the laws of the land.
