Gift Orban is full of excitement after scoring four times in KAA Gent’s 7-2 win against Zulte Waregem on Sunday night. After failing to register a goal in the first half, Orban netted four times in the second half. That made him the first Gent player to score four times in a Belgian Pro League game this century. The 20-year-old was on target in the 53rd, 68th, 75th and 83rd minutes respectively. “For me, it is the first time that I am taking the match ball home,” he said after the game “As a professional, I never scored a hat trick, now it’s the first time. And then immediately four, that’s very nice. ” Orban has now scored nine goals in his last eight games for Gent. He only moved to Gent from the Norwegian second-division club, Staebek in January.
