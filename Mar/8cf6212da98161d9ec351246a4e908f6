The pastor of Restoration Bible Church, Itiam Street, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, Prophet Anwana Peter Essien has been sentenced to 21 years in prison for defiling his 10-year-old step daughter. The Prophet, a native of Afaha Ise in Ibiono Ibom Local Government Area, defiled his victim, a JSS 1 student on 9th August, 2019, when her mother brought her and her younger sister for holiday to their stepfather’s house. The convict in his evidence admitted to the crime saying that the “devil pushed him at midnight to forcefully have a carnal knowledge of his step daughter.” Delivering his judgement, the presiding judge, Justice Okon Okon, who condemned the act, held that the confession was direct and unequivocal that the convict committed the crime. He said the evidence of prosecution witnesses such as the medical report and the confessional statement have proven beyond every reasonable doubt that the convict was guilty of the crime. While committing him into prison for 21 years, justice Okon said it was with effect from the time the convict was taken into custody in the Uyo Custodial Centre.
