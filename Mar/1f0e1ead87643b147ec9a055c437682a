Ekiti State athletics have scooped four nominations in the fifth edition of the Athletic Heat Awards. General Manager, Ekiti State Sports Council, Mr Kunle Adeyemi who made this known in Ado Ekiti described the award platform as one that recognises, celebrates and rewards Nigerian athletes who excelled in the past year. He noted that Fakorede Adekalu was nominated in the Junior Male Athlete of the Year and Next Rated Athlete of the Year categories while Aladeloye Adetutu was nominated in the Under-18 Female Athlete of the Year category. Adeyemi noted that producing two of the athletes among the nominees, it was only natural that the state’s athletics coach, Isiaka Oluyemi would be nominated in the Coach of the Year category. “I am happy with the nominations and it is a sign of the hard work that has been put into making sure that the athletes perform well at events. “Two of our athletes were nominated this time around; we are sure that with more effort and better performances by our athletes and coaches, we will have more nominees from Ekiti next time, ” he said. Adeyemi appreciated Governor Biodun Oyebanji for the efforts aimed at the continued development of sports in Ekiti. He also used the opportunity to appeal to well-to-do individuals and corporate organisations to support the efforts of the state government at developing sports, stressing the importance of using sporting activities to curb youth restiveness and making a career out of sports among other benefits accruable from the sector.
