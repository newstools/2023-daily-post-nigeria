Justice E. Okpe of the Federal Capital Territory High Court, Nyanya in Abuja has convicted and sentenced a property owner, Mercy Yusuf and her company, T.M. Properties Limited. She got 24 years jail term for fraudulently obtaining $298,000 and N40million from Bacab Properties Limited after claiming ownership of Plot 1721 Jahi District Cadastral Zone B08, Abuja. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on October 20, 2021 arraigned Yusuf on a four counts charge on obtaining money by false pretence, forgery and using false documents as genuine. The defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges, prompting the commencement of trial on February 1, 2022. EFCC prosecutors called six witnesses and tendered 14 documents that were admitted in evidence as exhibits. The defendants opened their defence on November 1, 2022, with Yusuf testifying on behalf of herself and the second T.M. Limited. Delivering judgment, Justice Okpe held that the prosecution proved the case against the defendants beyond reasonable doubt. They were found guilty on all the counts: 10 years imprisonment on counts one and two, and 2 years imprisonment on counts three and four to run concurrently. The court further ordered the convicts to make restitution in the sum of $298,000 and N41million to the nominal complainant.
