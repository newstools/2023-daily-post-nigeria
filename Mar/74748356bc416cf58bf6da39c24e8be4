Bashir, son of Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State, has predicted that Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, would become the next President Muhammadu Buhari. He disclosed this while commending Kwankwaso over the outcome of the presidential election. Kwankwaso came fourth in the just-concluded presidential election behind Peter Obi of Labour Party, Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party, and Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress, APC. During the election, Kwankwaso polled most votes in Kano State, a situation that made some critics describe him as “President of Kano.” In a tweet, Bashir wrote: “Those laughing at Kwankwaso that he is only the President of Kano State will not be laughing so much in a few years. He is the next Buhari, potentially.”
