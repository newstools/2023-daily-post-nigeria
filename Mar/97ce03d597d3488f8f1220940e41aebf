The Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has called on the President-elect, Bola Tinubu to stop rejoicing over his victory at the just-concluded elections. The popular clergy who addressed journalists in Akure, Ondo State, on Sunday, asked Tinubu to return the certificate issued by Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, stressing that Nigerians would reclaim their mandates. Giwa’s assertion is coming amid protests by opposition parties including the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and the Labour Party, LP, over alleged fraud in the election process. The electoral body had, however, frowned at the allegations raised against it by the parties and other concerned Nigerians, promising to be better in the governorship and state assembly poll. According to Giwa, there would be no Nigeria if the president-elect takes the mantle of leadership from President Muhammadu Buhari on May 29. While describing Tinubu as biblical Abimelech, the son of Gideon in the book of Judges Chapter 9, Giwa said, “Tell him not to rejoice, Nigerians will reclaim their mandate because Tinubu forced himself on them. “I doubt if Mr. Bola Tinubu would be the one to transform Nigeria and lead the people to God. There will be ethnic and serious religious crises if this injustice stands. “This will have painful repercussions if they fail to listen and allow the will of Nigerian people. You can’t force yourself on people, it’s dangerous”.
