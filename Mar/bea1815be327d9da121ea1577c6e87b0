Tottenhamâ€™s first team players and staff are privately pleading with former manager Mauricio Pochettino to return to the club. Antonio Conte is fighting for his future at Tottenham and their exit from the Champions League on Tuesday evening has not helped matters. Spurs fell to a 1-0 defeat to the Italians at San Siro, Milan and were held to a 0-0 draw in the second leg at the Tottenham Stadium. They have also been knocked out by Sheffield United in the FA Cup last week. There is no talk of Conte, which expires at the end of the season, with the Italian keen to return to his homeland. Sky Sports that Spurs senior players have contacted Pochettino to ask for him to come back to the club. Tottenham sacked Pochettino in 2019, just months after he guided them to the Champions League final. Jose Mourinho, Nuno Espirito Santo and Conte have since coached the team but none of them have come close to playing the free-flowing football that made Pochettino so popular.
