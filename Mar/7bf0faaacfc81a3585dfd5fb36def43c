Dr Alex Otti, the gubernatorial candidate of the Labour Party LP, in Abia State, has declared that the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, is dead and shall be buried at the polls on March 11. He was speaking at a reception organised in his honour by the CY Nwankwo Foundation which took place at Isiala Ngwa Local Government Area of Abia State at the weekend. Otti boasted that the Labour Party killed PDP, having won one of the three senatorial seats and six out of eight House of Representatives seats in Abia State in the concluded National Assembly elections conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, on February 25, 2023. Describing LP as the leading party in Abia State, he further claimed the PDP in its last ditch effort to hang on to power has gone to town with evil propaganda against him. His words: “If you listen, you will hear all the things coming out from this sinking state government of PDP. How they would unleash violence, how they would ensure that there won’t be any voting, how they would write results, how they would use money and buy up everybody and all that.” Continuing, he said: “They have also gone ahead to reappoint some miscreants they had sacked earlier [including a] local government transition committee chairman. “I think they’re just reacting like a man that is drowning. But they’re already drowned and we are going to bury them on the 11th of March 2023.” Otti added: “If you check the social media space, all they’re doing now is releasing fake reports purportedly coming from me. One of the things they have said is that I am going to sack most of the civil servants. “In fact, it is the government appointees that are the ones circulating this on the various social media platforms.”
