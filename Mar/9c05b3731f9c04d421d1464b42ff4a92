Anambra State Governor, Chukwuma Soludo, has denied reports that he held a meeting with the president-elect, Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the All Progressive Congress (APC), at the Imo State Government House, Owerri, on how to stop the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate, Mr. Peter Obi from pursuing the process to reclaim his mandate through a court process. Tinubu was declared the winner of the Feb. 25 Presidential election by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC. The former Lagos State governor polled 8,794,726 votes to beat Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, who got 6.96 million votes and Obi, who garnered 6.1 million votes, according to INEC announcement last Wednesday. Reports had emerged that a helicopter allegedly flew into Awka by 1:30am on Sunday and took Soludo to a secret meeting at Government House, Owerri. Details of the said meeting were unknown but it was gathered that Tinubu was said to be expressing concern about the growing popularity of Obi and solicited the help of Soludo to find a solution. However, in his reaction, Soludo, through his Press Secretary, Christian Aburime, said the allegations were false and disgusting. Aburime, in a statement made available to journalists in Awka, on Monday, said, “The general public is advised to disregard the allegations. Ndi Anambra should also disregard all the insinuations and come out to vote massively for APGA this Saturday for the State House of Assembly election in order to sustain the developmental strides of the present administration of Governor Soludo. “If certain people could sit somewhere and cook up a story of this nature, it becomes highly reprehensible and certainly deserves to be condemned by every right-thinking person.”
