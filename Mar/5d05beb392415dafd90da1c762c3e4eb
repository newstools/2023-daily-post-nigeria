The All Progressives Congress, APC, Presidential Campaign Committee, PCC, has stated that it has no standing agreement with the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, in respect of the forthcoming governorship election as is being speculated. Revealing this in Ibadan on Wednesday during an interview with journalists, Nike Ajagbe, a member of the committee, noted that there was no agreement between the President-elect, Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Makinde. Reacting to the news emanating from the meeting between the aggrieved candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the state and the governor, Ajagbe disclosed that Tinubu was a party man who could not joke with the success of his APC across the country, especially the South-West, which is regarded as his stronghold. ”It was in the campaign committee programme to visit opposition governors whenever they were in their state for the campaign. The visit had nothing to do with the endorsement of the Makinde.” Governor Seyi Makinde is said to have disclosed to the aggrieved candidates, who lost the National Assembly election to the opposition party APC, that he had agreed with the president elect to defect to the APC after the election, which Tinubu supported.
