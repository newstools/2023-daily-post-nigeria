The Lagos State Police Command has vowed to prosecute people spreading fake news and “provocative content” on social media with the intent to cause panic in the state. The spokesman of the command, Benjamin Hundeyin, stated this on Monday. Hundeyin was reacting to the increase in the level of propaganda and inciting ethnic statements among social media users ahead of the March 11 gubernatorial election. He also revealed the police in the state have begun investigations into related cases with the aim of prosecuting those found guilty. “The command has begun investigating this scaremongering with a view to apprehending and prosecuting those found culpable. “The good people and residents of the state are urged to disregard all forms of messages, especially on social media depicting fictitious, fallacious, and preposterous claims aimed at jeopardizing the peace currently being enjoyed in the state,” Hundeyin said.
