Chukwueze, who was on target in his previous two league games, provided the assists for the Yellow Submarine’s two goals. The winger set up Gerard Moreno for the opening goal in the 76th minute. The Nigeria international also provided the assist for Jose Luis Morales’ second goal two minutes from time. Chukwueze is now the first Nigerian player to reach 10+ goals and assists in a single season while playing for a top-five European league team.
