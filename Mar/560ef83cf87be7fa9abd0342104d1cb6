Transfer guru, Fabrizio Romano, has reacted to rumours linking Napoli striker Victor Osimhen with a summer move to Arsenal. Osimhen had been linked with a move to Arsenal at the end of the season. Arsenal’s English Premier League rivals Manchester United and Chelsea are also interested in the 24-year-old. However, according to Romano, Arsenal seem to have cover in the centre-forward position, and their priority in the summer is to strengthen Mikel Arteta’s squad with the signing of a midfielder. He added that Osimhen’s price tag would be really huge. Writing in his column for Caughtoffside, Romano said: “I don’t have it confirmed, as of now. Arsenal have Gabriel Jesus, Nketiah, Balogun and also, Osimhen’s price tag will be really huge. “I think Arsenal have different priorities for this summer, including a new midfielder.”
