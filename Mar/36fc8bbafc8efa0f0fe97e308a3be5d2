Mohamed Salah has penned his name in Liverpool’s and English Premier League’s history books by overtaking Robbie Fowler as the Reds’ all-time highest Premier League goalscorer against rivals Manchester United. Salah smashed in Liverpool’s fourth goal to grab his brace and wrote his name in the annals of EPL football history. Liverpool ran riot over the Red Devils, whitewashing their rivals 7-0 in a game that will be remembered for ages. The brace means the Egyptian King has netted 129 top-flight goals for the club, beating Reds icon Fowler in the process. Impressively, Liverpool’s No11 managed the feat in just 203 matches, significantly fewer than the former striker. The 30-year-old has been a revelation at Anfield and has played his part in helping the Merseyside club win the Premier League title in 2019-20 — their first since the top flight was rebranded in 1992.
