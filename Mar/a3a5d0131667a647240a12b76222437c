The chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, in Kogi State, Comrade Onuh Edoka has told workers that no government in power can seal their secretariat if they embark on industrial action. Edoka disclosed this on Monday during the commissioning of the first ultra-modern NLC secretariat in Lokoja, Kogi State. The NLC chairman in his speech said: “No government can come out and close this secretariat if workers embark on strike. This secretariat belongs to us. The government offered little support in the building of our secretariat. We know what is happening in other states where [for example the] NLC secretariat was built by the state government. So we are careful. That is why we went all out to source funds to build [this] NLC secretariat by ourselves, with little support from government.” Edoka, who will be handing over to a new executive of NLC this week, appreciated the Kogi State governor, Yahaya Bello, for his support towards ensuring that NLC in Kogi State has its secretariat after over 30 years of existence. He also commended the Kogi State Auditor-General of Local Government, Alhaji Usman Ododo for his support in the completion of the secretariat. Edoka appealed to Kogi workers to always support NLC towards achieving their goals in the state. In his remarks, the national president of NLC, Comrade Joe Ajaero, who was represented by General Secretary Emmanuel Ogwaja, commended the leadership of NLC for its remarkable achievement in the state. Ajaero commended the unity among unions in Kogi State, stressing that when workers unite, their struggles will not go in vain. He enjoined them to make the office accessible to every worker in Kogi State stressing that nobody can proscribe labour union in the country.
