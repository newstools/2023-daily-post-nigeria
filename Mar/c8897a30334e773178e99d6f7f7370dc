Chelsea head manager, Graham Potter, has responded to rumours linking midfielder Mason Mount with a move to the club’s Premier League rivals, Liverpool. Mount is likely to leave Chelsea this summer after talks between his representatives and the Bleus hit a wall over a contract extension. Liverpool are increasingly confident of signing the England international at the end of the season. Mount has less than 18 months to run on his current contract with Chelsea and he has made it clear that his preference is to remain at the west London club. However, after spending over £600million since Todd Boehly’s takeover last summer, Chelsea are walking a Financial Fair Play tightrope. When asked about reports linking his Mount to Liverpool in his pre-match press conference on Friday, Potter said ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League tie with Leeds United on Saturday that the 24-year-old is suffering at the moment. Potter said, “Mason has been great to work with. He’s been top. He Is suffering like the rest of us because we want to do better. “In terms of the contract, that Is between him and the club. I am the head coach, so my focus is on helping the players improve. That is the focus for me.”
