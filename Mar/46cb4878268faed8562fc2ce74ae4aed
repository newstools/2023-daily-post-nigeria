A special adviser to Ekiti State governor, Chief Jide Awe, has described the victory of All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Bola Tinubu, at the presidential poll as the will of God that beats all political and religious permutations. Chief Awe noted that Tinubu’s presidential victory is long envisaged before now, saying he is a “man with a bold heart despite the challenges he faced on his way, and he can still go ahead to win the election.” Awe, a former two-time chairman of the APC in Ekiti State, said Tinubu is not just a politician but a distant runner that is focused and straightforward in all ramifications. Awe, addressing newsmen in Ado Ekiti, pointed out that Asiwaju’s time has come as the president, adding that the victory is not for a single man, but it belongs to the entire citizens of the country. describing the election as “very technical,” he avowed that the APC candidate “won in some key areas in the north where the giant fell.” He noted that if Obi could have the whole South East, there is no basis for agitation, stressing that restructuring and good governance are what Nigerians are agitating for. Losers in any election will always complain, Awe said. “Victory has come for Asiwaju and for Nigerians,” he added.
