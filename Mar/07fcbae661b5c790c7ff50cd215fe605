Police operatives from the Bauchi State Police Command on Friday foiled a kidnap attempt at Rafin Cora village in Ningi Local Government Area of the state. The operatives killed a member of the gang. The gang, according to the command’s Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Ahmed Mohammed Wakil, had invaded the residence of one Alhaji Abdulhamid Muhammad in the village and attempted to kidnap his 28-year-old son, Usman Abdulhamid. Following the victim’s resistance to be taken away by the kidnappers, he was shot multiple times in his lower abdomen. The police spokesman, a Superintendent of Police (SP), stated in a press release he signed and made available to DAILY POST on Sunday in Bauchi that a joint team of police and vigilantes, led by the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in charge of Ningi, later arrived the crime scene and engaged in gun duel with the kidnappers. According to the spokesman, “On receipt of the information, the police operatives, jointly with a local vigilante group, led by DPO Ningi swiftly mobilised to the scene to counter the kidnappers from accomplishing their mission in the village. “The kidnappers welcomed police operatives with sporadic gunshots. “While responding, the operatives engaged them in a gun duel which forced them to scamper in disarray with possible gunshot wounds. “Consequently, one of the kidnappers met his waterloo on the spot, while one AK-47 was retrieved during the encounter,” Wakil stated. He added that the victim was rescued and immediately taken to the Federal Medical Centre in Birnin Kudu, Jigawa State, for treatment. Wakil then assured that the police were making concerted efforts with a view to trailing and arresting the fleeing suspects in order for them to face the full wrath of the law.
