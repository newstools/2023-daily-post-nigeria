Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State has said the Igbo alone can’t make themselves president. Umahi made the remark while noting that he’s not against the Southeast voting for Peter Obi during the last presidential election. He spoke with his supporters at the Ebonyi international airport on Monday, NAN reports. The governor said the Southeast must work with other regions to stand a chance of producing Nigeria’s president. Umahi said: “The Southeast must work. It is not right to condemn Obi’s feat as the south east has made a strong statement with it. “One digs with two arrowed woods so that when one fails to stick on the target, the other wood will stick to it. “Soludo of Anambra harped on this fact and was crucified but his words have come to pass. “The wise thing for the Igbos to do is to tell themselves the truth that we alone cannot make ourselves president. “We have to work with other tribes as the south west did with the north and have succeeded.”
