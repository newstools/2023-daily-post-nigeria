Spokesperson of the Okechinyere Abia Campaign Council of the PDP gubernatorial candidate, Hon. Uzo Azubuike asked Ndi Abia to vote massively for Chief Okey Ahiwe of the Peoples Democratic Party as governor on Saturday. Azubuike, A former Abia State House of Assembly Deputy Speaker, asserted: “Okey Ahiwe is the one who would get Abia working quickly and efficiently. “Ahiwe knows what to do. He would not waste our time learning how government works. “Let us end the confusion about Peter Obi and the governorship election. Obi is not a candidate. Obi’s qualities belong to him; nobody can pretend he will confer them on a candidate in Abia State. “Alex Otti is not Peter Obi and cannot be Peter Obi. He should quit the pretence. Chief Ahiwe has qualities he is bringing to the table when elected Governor. He has public and private sector experience, knows the issues, would not make the mistakes of a neophyte in government, and is accessible and offers listening ears to people.” According to him: “Ndi Abia will have in Chief Ahiwe of PDP the best option in the parade of candidates for the election.” Azubuike further explained that Ndi Abia played national politics in the presidential election. “The governorship and state assembly elections deal directly with our local matters. The issues at stake are very different from the election of 25 February,” he said while appealing to Ndi Abia to vote for the PDP in the March 11 governorship election. Chief Ahiwe, the PDP candidate, is a Political Science graduate of the University of Lagos and a Catholic Knight who started his education at Ahiara Technical School. He has promised to run an inclusive government that would put Abia State on the path of development and progress.
