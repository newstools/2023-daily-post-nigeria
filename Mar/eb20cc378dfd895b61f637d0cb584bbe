The campaign convoy of Labour Party’s governorship candidate, Jonathan Asake, was attacked by thugs on Friday in Gidan Waya, Jema’a Local Government Area of Kaduna State. A statement issued by James Swam, media aide to Asake, said: “Four youths were injured in the process, including two boys and two girls while no vehicle was damaged.” The incident happened when the campaign convoy was passing through Gidan Waya during Friday prayers on its way to Godogodo and other towns as the campaign team tour the local government. After the first three vehicles in the convoy made their way through the old tyres used to demarcate the road, thugs started throwing stones, sticks and other harmful objects at the convoy. It took the timely intervention of the security personnel attached to the candidate to forestall the situation from snowballing into a crisis.
