The approval covers civil servants working in polytechnics and colleges of education run by the state government. The government also approved 40 years as the length of service year for its teaching and non-teaching staff. Commissioner for Information, Charles Aniagwu said the decision was taken at the State Executive Council meeting on Monday. Other approvals included the upward review of road projects, new roads contracts, among others. “Teachers and non-teaching staff in the public schools of Delta can be in the office up to 65 years of age. “And teachers can also be in the office for as much as 40 years,” the official said. Until now, 60 years was the retirement age, while 35 years was the permitted years of service.
