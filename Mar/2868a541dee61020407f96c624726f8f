As lobbying for the 10th National Assembly intensifies at the upper and lower legislative chambers, a group operating under the aegis of Movement For Democratic Consolidation (MDC) has called for a balancing of power to foster unity in the country. The group noted that the procedure for the selection of principal officers in the House of Representatives should accommodate various interests. In a statement issued by MDC’s national coordinator, Hon. Olaleye Olusegun and South West coordinator, Otunba Oladokun Charles Aridunnu-Omo, the group called for support for the candidature of Hon. Prince Olaide Akinremi (Jagaban) for Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives. Hon. Akinremi is a member representing Ibadan North Federal Constituency of Oyo State. The group argued that zoning the deputy speakership to Oyo State would balance power among the six geopolitical zones. The group applauded the APC hierarchy for organizing a meeting on Monday, March 13, 2023, to address the proposed leadership issues ahead of the inauguration of the 10th National Assembly. According to Olusegun: [This move] will also give assurance that only members-elect with track records and competency are saddled with the responsibility of piloting [the] affairs of the National Assembly for the next four years. “The President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, his Vice-President-elect, Sen. Kassim Shettima and the APC National Working Committee members have shown more commitment about who become principal officers and will not disappoint Nigerians who trusted APC with majority votes in the Presidential and National Assembly elections.”
