Arsenal striker, Gabriel Jesus, was part of the team’s training session on Wednesday ahead of their Europa League tie with Sporting CP on Thursday. But the likes of Leandro Trossard, Eddie Nketiah and Kieran Tierney were among those absent. Jesus has not featured for Arsenal since the 2022 FIFA World Cup after requiring knee surgery last December. However, the Brazil international is now closing on a return as he joined his Gunners teammates for Wednesday’s training session before they travel to Lisbon. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta is likely to confirm on Wednesday evening whether Jesus will be able to play any part in their Europa League tie on Thursday. But Arteta’s side are set to be without Trossard, Nketiah and Tierney for the trip to Portugal. Trossard was forced off in the first half of Arsenal’s Premier League 3-2 victory over Bournemouth last Saturday due to a groin injury, while Nketiah missed the win against Bournemouth due to an ankle problem and was not able to train on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Tierney, who had started just two games for Arsenal in 2023, will also miss the Sporting clash due to illness.
