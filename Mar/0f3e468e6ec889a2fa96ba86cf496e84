Former Chelsea winger, Florent Malouda, has urged his former club to sign ‘world-class player’ Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur at the end of the season. Malouda said it would be a great signing if Chelsea brought Kane to Stamford Bridge. Kane, 29, has been linked with a move away from Spurs following their Champions League exit at the hands of AC Milan in mid-week. Speaking to DAZN Bet, Malouda said: “Chelsea should definitely join the race for Harry Kane. Kane is a world-class player who knows the Premier League, and it’s an era where Chelsea needs a striker with his goalscoring record and the ambition to win trophies. If Kane ever leaves Tottenham, it will be because of the lack of trophies. “Kane would be a great signing, but I would be surprised if he left Tottenham for Chelsea because of the rivalry. It is not like leaving Tottenham for Arsenal, but to leave Tottenham for Chelsea, I would be surprised, but anything is possible. He is a great option for any club in the Premier League, and for Chelsea, he’d be a great pick.”
