The All Progressives Congress (APC) said it respects the decision of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to postpone the governorship and state house of assembly elections. The national exercise was Wednesday night moved from Saturday 11th March to Saturday 18th March 2023. The shift followed the ruling by the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal on the reconfiguration of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) used for the presidential election. APC noted INEC’s assurance that data from the presidential and national assembly elections will be properly backed up on its cloud facilities. A statement on Thursday by National Publicity Secretary, Felix Morka urged the commission to “preserve and protect the integrity of the extracted data from BVAS”. The ruling party advised INEC to use the opportunity presented by the postponement to address gaps or hitches identified during the last poll. The APC, however, insists President-elect, Bola Tinubu emerged as “the overwhelming choice of Nigerians in the presidential election which was free and fair” in accordance with the Electoral Act. Morka urged supporters and other Nigerians “to double down on their support for our great party, and its candidates” next Saturday.
