President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated Vice President Oluyemi Oluleke Osinbajo on the occasion of his 66th birthday. According to a statement on Wednesday by Femi Adesina, Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to Buhari, the President equally felicitated with the entire Osinbajo family, wishing them many happy returns, as their son, husband and father turns another year, in good health and sound mind. He lauded the sterling service the celebrant has provided to the country, as an academic, Attorney-General of Lagos State (1997-2007), and Vice President (2015 till date). Buhari applauded the deft way Osinbajo, a pastor with the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), has combined scholarship with governance, and pastoral work, commending such dedication to the younger generation whom the number 2 man serves as a torchbearer. “President Buhari wishes the Vice President and his family joyful celebration, and greater grace ahead,” the statement said.
