Ahead of the March 18 election, Prof. Shuaibu Oba-AbdulRaheem, the Kwara State governorship candidate of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), has claimed that Mahmood Yakubu, the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is being manipulated by some people. According to Oba-AbdulRaheem, he used to know Yakubu as an honest and upright man. Oba-AbdulRaheem spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Ilorin. He said, “The law is there to protect the poor masses, “he said. “The preparation has been very poor and it’s unlike the character of Mahmood Yakubu that I know. “I used to know him as an honest and upright man, but I think he’s being manipulated by some people. “The conscience of INEC has been touched because they appear to be the instrument that may be used by corrupt people to destabilise Nigeria,” he said. Recall that the gubernatorial election, earlier slated for March 11, was moved to March 18 to enable INEC to re-configure the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS).
