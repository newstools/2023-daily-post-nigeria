Former Manchester United player, Paul Parker has hit out at midfielder Scott McTominay, saying he should leave Old Trafford at the end of the summer. Parker said McTominay is not even good enough to play for Scottish Premier League giants, Celtic. McTominay has struggled for regular game time since Man United manager Erik ten Hag’s arrival at the club last summer. The 26-year-old has made 30 appearances, amassing a total game time of only 1,282 minutes so far this season. Speaking about McTominay, Parker told Mybettingsites, “Scott McTominay has to move away from Man United in the summer. “He wants to stay in the Premier League, but it is going to be tough for him to find a new club. “He’s not good enough to play for a top side and the smaller clubs can’t pay his wages.” He added, “I think it could be a possibility for him to go to Rangers. He’s not good enough to play for Celtic. There’s no way he would be able to play regularly for Celtic in the way they play. He’ll have a better chance of playing if he moves to Rangers.”
