Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan has said that Manchester United supporters should perish any hope of the Red Devils winning the title this season. As much as he believes that the Red Devils could close the gap on Arsenal and Manchester City, he said they still have a long way to go to be truly back to what they used to be. United have won the Carabao Cup already beating Newcastle 2-0 at the Wembley Stadium last weekend and are chasing the Europa League and FA Cup but Jordan believes that winning the Premier League would send a clear message that United are back to their old selves. “But when you’re talking about Man United being back, you are talking about Man United winning the Premier League,” he told talkSPORT. “Ask yourself, are they close to Manchester City, are they close to Arsenal? Possibly they may well be, but I still think there’s a journey they’ve got to go on.” The former club chairman pointed out that the Red Devils have not won the Premier League for a very long time now and still have a long way to go to achieve that.
