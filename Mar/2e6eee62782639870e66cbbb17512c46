The newly elected vice chairperson of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Ekiti State, Mrs Sanyaolu Adebola, who doubles as the Women leader of the Association of Nigeria Woman in Business Network (ANWBN), revealed that SMEs will be collaborating with the administration of Governor Biodun Oyebanji. Speaking with DAILY POST correspondent in Ado-Ekiti, she declared that the objective of the partnership is to entrench SMEs as a pillar of development in the state and thereby make them globally competitive. She said: “We are in partnership with Ekiti State Government; although we are yet to align ourselves with this particular government, we are planning to go and see him (Gov Oyebanji) to let him know that we exist.” Adebola urged youths to identify new concepts that would enable them to become self-employed rather than seeking salary jobs. “I want to advise our youths [that] immediately they graduate, and after their [national] service, they should not delight themselves in looking for white collar jobs or waiting for government to give them appointment; they can go into farming. I am also a farmer. They can grow in financial intelligence, using their hands and brain,” she said.
