A former National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Ahmed Makarfi has accused Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna-led government of planning to intimidate members of the party. Makarfi said the El-Rufai-led government was planning to arrest some key members of PDP based on trumped-up charges. He alleged that the plan was to use security agencies to arrest the PDP members so they won’t be able to participate in the forthcoming governorship and state assembly elections. The former governor said the state government has identified up to 80 members of the party it plans to arrest over alleged inciting statements. He added that the plan is to target the PDP strongholds and weaken them ahead of the forthcoming March 18 elections. Makarfi, who stated that the PDP already has the list in its possession, made the allegation while reacting to the arrest of the Director of Media and Publicity, Kaduna state PDP Campaign Council, Saidu Adamu, and two other PDP officials. According to him, “Our attention has been drawn to a list of our field officers, drawn up by the government to be arrested and detained until after the elections. This has grievous implications. “Those pencilled down for arrest were drawn from Kudan, Sanga, Igabi, Lere, Kachia, Jaba and Kaduna North Local Government Areas of the state which are believed to be PDP strongholds. “Honourable Adamu is still in detention and we do not know the alleged offenses he is being detained for and he has also not been charged to court, it is a very sad development.”
