The otherwise serene Adamawa State Muslim Council is currently rocked with a row relating to endorsements of politicians in the ongoing political transition. Trouble started when a majority number of the leadership announced the endorsement of Governor Ahmadu Fintiri, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the 2023 governorship election. In a move which confirmed that the endorsement did not go down well with some officials of the Council, the Secretary of the Council in Michika Local Government Area, Alhaji Abdulrahman Maina Yaji, has resigned. Yaji left his office in the Council, expressing sadness that it had been politicized and reduced to bread and butter organisation by some of its self-serving leaders. “The leadership has pinched their support to a particular governorship candidate, thereby derailing from its constitutional obligations of being a father to all shades of opinions,” Yaji said in his letter of resignation seen on Sunday. “The selfish and partisan activities of the Adamawa state leadership of Muslim Council, has seriously become a source of embarrassing jokes… As the Secretary of Muslim Council Michika Branch, I resolved to put my resignation from the position,” Yaji added. Endorsement questions similarly rocked the Adamawa State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) when the mainstream leadership reportedly endorsed Fintiri while the youth wing allegedly went to the side of Senator Aishatu Ahmed Binani of All Progressives Congress (APC).
