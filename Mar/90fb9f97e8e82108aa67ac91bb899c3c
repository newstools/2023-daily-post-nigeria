A former Governor of Anambra State, Dr. Chukwuemeka Ezeife has said that cancelling the 2023 presidential election is not the right thing. The former Governor said that all that the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has to do is go back to the documents and technology used in conducting the election and declare the original winner based on the results there. Ezeife was reacting to the call by individuals, civil society organisations, groups and foreign observers for the presidential election to be cancelled due to irregularities. He pointed out that so much of the country’s resources have been spent by INEC in organising the polls and that it would be wasteful going through that again. “Foreign countries are calling for cancellation [of the election] but I don’t think that’s the solution. It cost money,” he said on Arise Television. “How much did we spend in this election? [The solution is], go back to the documents, we go back to all the systems we used and look at the correct results that came out, especially those that came out before the problems arose [if there were any problems] or those that came out before the stoppage of uploading and declare winner on the basis of those results. There’s no point in wasting money,” he added.
