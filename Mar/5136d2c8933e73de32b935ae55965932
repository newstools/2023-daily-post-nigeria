Concerned residents of Enugu State have demanded justice for the murdered Labour Party Senatorial candidate for Enugu East district, Barr. Oyibo Chukwu. Chukwu was murdered a few days before the Presidential and National Assembly election. Angry residents of Enugu, across party divides, are now demanding that his death must not be swept under the carpet. Led by the immediate past Enugu State Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Dr Ben Nwoye, they said Chukwu, who was brutally murdered alongside five others by yet to be identified gunmen, must get justice. The protesters, clad in black attires, called for an end to political killings in the state. Nwoye said what we are demanding is nothing but, “justice over the death of Barrister Chukwu who was brutally murdered on the 22nd of February on his way back from campaign.” He said the Amurri people have lost a rare gem who had contributed meaningfully to the development of the area. “We are calling for an investigation into his murder; our demand is that the perpetrators should be brought to book,” he further stated. The concerned citizens carried placards with various inscriptions such as: “we demand justice for Oyibo Chukwu”, “What has our brother done to be murdered like a goat”, “Enugu State has wasted our brother without recourse”. They were at the premises of the Court of Appeal, Enugu Division, the State High Court, as well as several other strategic locations in the state capital. Some of the protesters, who spoke to journalists, were embittered about the gruesome killing of the former chairman of NBA Oji River branch. Another protester, who gave his name as Mr. Kenneth Egbo, said: “Today it is Oyibo Chukwu, tomorrow who knows who will be the next?”
