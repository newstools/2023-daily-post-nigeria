Ahead of Saturday’s gubernatorial election, a former lawmaker and social critic, Senator Shehu Sani, has said that the Kano State branch of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, is in a bad shape and won’t be able to win the election. Sani’s statement is contained in a post via his verified Twitter handle on Monday. Recall the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, came a distant third in the state in the just concluded February 25 presidential election. “PDP in Kano is in a state of paralysis. A vote for the Governorship is a waste,” Sani tweeted.
