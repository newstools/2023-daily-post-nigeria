Abdullahi Adamu, national chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, said the party’s presidential candidate Bola Tinubu won the election fair and square. “Jagaban is the informed choice of the electorate. He clearly won fair and square,” his statement on Thursday reads. The politician noted that with Tinubu’s victory, the people have “renewed the tenancy of our political party in Aso Rock.” Adamu said Nigerians spoke “loud and clear” and congratulated the president-elect as well as party members and supporters “celebrating the resounding victory of our party at the polls.” The former Nasarawa governor commended Buhari for “the peaceful conduct of the elections” and for delivering on his promise to provide a level-playing field for parties and their candidates. Adamu, however, condemned “the shameful conduct” of the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and the Labour Party, LP, in their “attempts to sabotage the elections.” He said their demand for suspension of the announcement of results could have thrown the country into “chaos and avoidable crisis.” “It is a pity that they take their loss so badly. They ought to be good sportsmen and women in the political arena,” the statement added.
