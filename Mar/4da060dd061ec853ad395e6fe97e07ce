Atiku Abubakar, the Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has said his party protested at the national headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, in Abuja because all the provisions of the current Electoral law were completely contravened. DAILY POST had earlier reported that Atiku led a protest at the national headquarters of the INEC in Abuja. The Chairman of the PDP, Iyorchia Ayu, other party leaders and supporters were also present during the protest at INEC headquarters. Speaking to newsmen outside of the gate of INEC headquarter in Abuja, Atiku also vowed that the protest would continue. Atiku said, “All the provisions of the current Electoral law have been completely contravened. We were protesting and then INEC was not listening and went on to announce the result. “That is why we are protesting. We have the right to protest and it will continue for a very long time, either every day or any other day. “We have the right to protest under the constitution, and it doesn’t stop us from going to the court,” he said. Atiku and his Labour Party counterpart Peter Obi lost the Feb. 25 Presidential election to the APC’s Bola Tinubu. The former Vice President came in second position behind the winner and President-elect Tinubu.
