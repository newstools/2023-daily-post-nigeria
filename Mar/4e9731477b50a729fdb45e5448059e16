Succour came the way of victims of the recent fire incident that gutted some shops at the popular Muda Lawal Market in Bauchi as the State Governor, Bala Mohammed, donated N10 million to them with a promise to reconstruct the affected shops. The governor made the donation when he visited the market to assess the level of damage done by the midnight inferno and directed the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) to take inventory of the loss. While saying that the money, to be shared among affected victims, was meant to provide immediate relief for them, Governor Mohammed also promised to install a transformer to boost the power supply in the market with a view to improving commercial activities there. Speaking on behalf of the victims, the Chairman, Muda Lawal Market Association, Bala Mai Kaji, expressed appreciation to the governor for the visit. Mai Kaji informed that the association was already assessing the extent of the damage for it to identify those directly affected, assuring that the money donated by Governor Mohammed would be given only to the affected persons.
