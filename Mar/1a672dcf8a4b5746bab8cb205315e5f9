Party chieftain and former governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress in Abia State, Chief Daniel Eke, on Tuesday, applauded the re-election of former governor of the state, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, for a second term in office. DAILY POST gathered Kalu garnered a total of 30,805 votes to defeat his major opponents, Mao Ohuabunwa of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, who polled 15, 175 votes and Nnamdi Iroh of the Labour Party who had 25,540 votes. Kalu was declared the winner of the Abia North senatorial zone election at the Ohafia collation centre by INEC’s returning officer, Chinedu Nnamdi. Earlier, Eke, while reacting to the outcome of the keenly-contested and concluded 2023 senatorial election in a statement on Wednesday, noted the people of Abia North had unequivocally spoken through the ballot, as a sign of gratitude and reciprocation on unequalled representation the federal lawmaker has offered to people of the area. He pointed out that the current Majority Chief whip of the Nigerian Senate has proportionately touched many lives of the people and also attested that Orji Kalu’s stay in office as governor and current senator “yielded massive sustainable economic and political development to our people.” “We are earnestly desirous of your elevation to higher office at the 10th Senate to serve our beloved nation, Nigeria, at a higher capacity,” the APC chieftain stated.
