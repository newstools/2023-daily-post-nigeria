The All Progressives Congress, APC governorship candidate in Benue State, Rev. Fr. Hyacinth Iormem Alia has condemned the new phase of attacks on communities in the state particularly Kwande and Gwer-West Local Government by gunmen suspected to be herders. DAILY POST reports that over ten persons have been killed in separate attacks in the Local Government Areas since the Saturday presidential and National Assembly. Reacting Fr. Alia in a statement issued on Friday by his Media Aide, Isaac Uzaan, wondered why the herdsmen invasion of Benue Communities and gruesome murder of innocent citizens could not be curtailed. The APC candidate faulted the resurgence of the brutal killings lamenting why such attacks were coming on the heels of the elections that produced the president-elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. While calling on security agencies to deploy enough personnel and intensify surveillance at the troubled areas, Fr. Alia warned those who may be cashing â€“ in on insecurity in Benue State and also using it for political gains to rethink and consider turning over a new leaf immediately to avert the wrath of God. The priest of God wondered in particular why Benue State has remained vulnerable to such attacks considering the number of security agencies domiciled in the state, and answerable to the state Chief Security Officer.
