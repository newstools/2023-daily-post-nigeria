The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, on Wednesday revealed that Nigeria would witness unprecedented development under the government of President-elect Bola Tinubu. Gbajabiamila said this while congratulating Tinubu on his victory in the recently concluded 2023 presidential election. He said that God has answered Nigerians’ prayers, adding that Tinubu’s victory is a testament to his years of hard work and building bridges across Nigeria. This was contained in a statement by Gbajabiamila’s Special Adviser, Lanre Lasisi. The statement reads in part: “The victory of the president-elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is a victory for democracy. I have said time and again that Tinubu is the best for Nigeria at this time, and God has answered our prayers. “Since the beginning of the journey, we were convinced that Nigerians would vote for him because he did it before and he will do it for the country. Today, Lagos is what it is courtesy of Tinubu’s vision. With Asiwaju’s victory, Nigeria will witness unprecedented development.” “But this victory didn’t come on a platter of gold. It was a well-fought and deserved one.” Tinubu was declared the winner of last Saturday’s presidential election by the Chairman of INEC, Professor Mahmood Yakubu. The former Lagos State governor defeated the likes of Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and Peter Obi of the Labour Party, LP, to emerge the winner. Tinubu received his Certificate of Return on Wednesday in Abuja.
