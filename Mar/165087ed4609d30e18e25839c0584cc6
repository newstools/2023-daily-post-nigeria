Festus Keyamo, the spokesman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Presidential Campaign Council, has mocked the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, over its protest in Abuja. Keyamo said the protest was actually a funeral procession led by undertakers who refused zoning prior to the presidential election. PDP’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar led a protest at the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, over the outcome and results announced. INEC had declared Bola Tinubu of the APC winner of the presidential election after defeating Atiku and Labour Party’s Peter Obi. But, Atiku and his party had frowned at the election, which they claimed was flawed with irregularities and electoral malpractice. However, Keyamo mocked the PDP leaders for adorning black dresses during the protest. In a series of tweets, Keyamo wrote: “The adorning of black dresses by the PDP leaders in their protest to INEC office did the right thing because the event was actually a funeral procession. “The undertakers of PDP who refused to adhere to the principle of zoning took the corpse to the gates of INEC for proper burial. “If you observe the way a spokesman for PDP cries like a baby every minute on video, you will realise that his entire bogus life and future depended on their warped expectation of Atiku’s victory. “That is what happens to you when you venture into politics without a second address.”
