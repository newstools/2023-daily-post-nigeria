The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), led by its National Chairman, Sen. Iyorchia Ayu and National Working Committee members on Monday urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to cancel the Feb. 25 Presidential election and to re-conduct a very credible election. Ayu stated this while presenting a party protest letter to INEC in Abuja. Recall that INEC had declared the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu as the winner of the presidential election. Tinubu defeated the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar and his Labour Party counterpart, Peter Obi. The former Lagos State governor has since received his Certificate of Return. “On behalf of the people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the teeming members of the PDP, we present this protest letter to INEC, addressed to the Commission Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu,” Ayu said. “We don’t accept the charades of what has been presented to Nigeria people as election and what has been declared. “We, there, call on INEC not only to cancel the election but to re-conduct a very credible election, not only to Nigerians but also the international community.” Receiving the letter, Mr Festus Okoye, the INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, commended the PDP for a peaceful protest. Okoye promised to submit the letter to the appropriate authorities for necessary action. “I have received this letter on behalf of the commission, if there are remedial issues to be dealt with, we’re going to deal with those remedial issues. This commission is for the Nigerian people. Our allegiance is for the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” he said.
