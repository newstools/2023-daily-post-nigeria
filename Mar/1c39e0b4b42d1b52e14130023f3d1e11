Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has reacted to forward Mohamed Salah’s penalty miss against Bournemouth in their 1-0 Premier League defeat on Saturday afternoon. Salah missed a penalty during Liverpool’s defeat against Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium. The Egyptian international had the golden opportunity to peg one back for Klopp’s side in the 69th minute when Adam Smith gave away a penalty by handling the ball. However, the former Chelsea and AS Roma winger, who is ever-reliable from the spot, absolutely blazed his penalty wide. Despite a strong start to the game, Liverpool faded as the game went on as Philip Billing scored the only goal of the game in the 28th minute. Liverpool’s defeat against Bournemouth is coming after they thrashed Manchester United 7-0 last weekend. Reacting to Salah’s penalty miss after the game, Klopp said at his post-match press conference: “He scores a lot of goals, he missed a penalty. That’s life.
