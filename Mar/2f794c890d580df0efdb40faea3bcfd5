Twelve legal practitioners are part of Peter Obi’s legal team to challenge the victory of President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The Senior Advocates of Nigeria, SANs, in order of seniority, are Dr Livy Uzoukwu, Chief Awa Kalu, Dr Onyechi Ikpeazu, P.I.N. Ikwueto, Chief Ben Anyachebe. Others include S.T. Hon, Arthur Obi Okafor, Ik Ezechukwu, J.S. Okutepa, Dr Mrs Valerie Azinge, Emeka Okpoko, and Alex Ejesieme. “These are not all the Senior Advocates on the team. More are still signing up,” an inside source told DAILY POST. On Wednesday, the Court of Appeal in Abuja will rule on the application filed by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC. INEC is seeking to reconfigure the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System, BVAS, used to conduct the 2023 presidential election on February 25. On Tuesday, the legal team of the Labour Party presidential candidate moved a motion to stop INEC from tampering with the evidence in a matter going to the Presidential Election Tribunal. The lawyers argued that the data on the BVAS contains the substance of Obi’s case against INEC’s “unlawful manipulation” of the February 25 election results and processes. They informed the court that its forensic experts had not been granted access to INEC systems to inspect them before the said transfer of data. But the umpire said it will transfer the data on the BVAS to a backup server ahead of the governorship and state legislative elections billed for March 11. The case is being heard by a three-person Court of Appeal panel headed by Justice Joseph Ikyegh. INEC declared Tinubu of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, the winner last Wednesday. The three main opposition parties, LP; Peoples Democratic Party, PDP; New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP; have all rejected the results. On February 28, the LP and PDP called for the resignation of the INEC chairman Prof Mahmood Yakubu and the cancellation of the election.
