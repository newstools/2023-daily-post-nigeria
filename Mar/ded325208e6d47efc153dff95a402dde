Scores of residents of the Olomo community in Apete, Ibadan, Oyo State capital, are currently in panic over the invasion by some armed robbers. Apete is one of the communities in the Ido Local Government Area in Oyo State. DAILY POST gathered on Saturday that some armed robbers invaded the Eleshin area in the Olomo community in Apete and robbed one Mr Dotun Adefisoye around 1 am. It was gathered that the armed robbers also transferred some amount of money from the bank account of Adefisoye’s wife. A source who spoke with DAILY POST said the matter had been reported at Apete Divisional Police Command. The residents added that some of them are currently in a state of confusion due to the robbery incident. “Dotun Adefisoye was robbed last night around Eleshin Olomo Apete Ibadan. “The robbers, about two, came around 1:00 am and carted away two phones, iPhone 11 Pro Max and XS Max. The matter has been reported at Apete Police Station. “They transferred undisclosed amount of money from the wife’s account,” a source told DAILY POST.
