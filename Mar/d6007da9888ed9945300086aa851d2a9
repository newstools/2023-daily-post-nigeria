Manchester United legend, Gary Neville has slammed Bruno Fernandes for demanding that manager Erik ten Hag took him off during their 7-0 defeat at Liverpool. Neville labelled Fernandes as “disgraceful” and “embarrassing”. Braces from Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez, Cody Gakpo and a late seventh from Roberto Firmino secured a stunning win for the Reds. Fernandes spent most of the second half making petulant challenges, arguing with officials and losing possession. He then threw his hands in the air when he saw it was Rashford who was being taken off after the fifth goal. “Bruno Fernandes is stood in the centre circle with his arms raised asking: ‘Why is it me not coming off? “Honestly, I have to say some of his behaviour in the second half has been a disgrace,” Neville said on Sky Sports.
