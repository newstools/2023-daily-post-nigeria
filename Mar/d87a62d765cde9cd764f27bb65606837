Former Aston Villa captain, Gabriel Agbonlahor has singled out Chelsea star Kai Havertz for criticism after he missed a seemingly easy chance during the Blues’ Premier League 1-0 win against Leeds United on Saturday. Recall that Chelsea defeated Leeds United at Stamford Bridge, thanks to Wesley Fofana’s second-half headed goal. Havertz’s miss was particularly glaring, as the Germany international failed to beat Leeds’ goalkeeper Illan Meslier in a one-on-one situation created by Raheem Sterling’s well-placed pass. And Agbonlahor was clearly unimpressed with Havertz’s performance against Leeds. Speaking to TalkSPORT, the former England international said, “Chelsea were there for the taking. They were not great. They were better than they were recently. “But I think Havertz, that one-on-one he had in the first half… It is like watching me go through 1v1, wasn’t it? It wasn’t convincing but they [Chelsea] would see it as ‘we won 1-0’ and it takes the pressure off [Graham Potter] a little bit.”
