Ahead of the March 18 gubernatorial and House of Assembly elections, a Civil Society Organization, Speak Out Africa Initiative, SOAI has urged that the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC and pro-democracy groups should do everything possible to gauge voters’ apathy. The group’s executive director, Kenneth Eze, made this call on Thursday in Abuja while launching Nigeria Votebeat Survey, NVS, to boost democratic participation. According to him, the commission must work toward redeeming its already broken trust in the minds of Nigeria electorates following the aftermath of the February 25 presidential and National Assembly Elections. He added that the judiciary should air the ongoing presidential/National Assembly Appeal Court Tribunal Hearing live for Nigerians to participate and feel a sense of belonging. “Thus, we are committed to safeguarding the participation of voters in an election. Whatever will create voter apathy is an enemy of democracy and should be confronted headlong. “And other future elections; – a task the CSO have laboured so much to make the Nigerian voter confident in INEC. It must not be eroded. Hence, why we launched the Nigeria VoteBeat Survey (NVS) to gauge, identify, diagnose & address the possible electoral deficits”. Esther Ogbono and Oluchi Alphonous, members of SOAI, said the survey would further deepen democracy in Nigeria.
