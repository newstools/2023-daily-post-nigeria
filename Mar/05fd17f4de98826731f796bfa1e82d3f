Liverpool legend, Jamie Carragher, has predicted that Bayern Munich will qualify for the Champions League quarter-final stage ahead of Paris Saint-Germain. Bayern and PSG will clash in the Champions League round of 16 second-leg fixture on Wednesday night in Germany. The Bundesliga giants defeated PSG 1-0 in the first leg in Paris last month. Bayern Munich head to the game after winning 2-1 against VfB Stuttgart in the Bundesliga. “I think it will be the last time we see Messi play in the Champions League this season,” Carragher said on CBS Sports. “I think Bayern Munich will go through.”
