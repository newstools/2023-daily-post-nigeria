Former Chelsea and Arsenal midfielder, Cesc Fabregas, has revealed two biggest regrets of his career as a footballer. Fabregas, who currently plays for Serie B side Como, said his lack of silverware with Arsenal when he was the captain of the North London club and also his failure to win the Champions League final with the Gunners in 2006 was his two biggest regrets as a professional footballer. The Spanish star said on Kammy and Ben’s Proper Football Podcast, “The biggest regret of my career will always be not winning that Champions League final [in 2006] that we were so, so close. “The first-ever, or the only Champions League final that Arsenal has ever played, and I was only 18. And we were so close. “Also, not lifting a trophy as an Arsenal captain was something that’ll always be in my heart because I gave so much. I exhausted myself so much.”
