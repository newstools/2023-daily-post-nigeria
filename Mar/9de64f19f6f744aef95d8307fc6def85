Gummen have threatened Paris Saint-Germain superstar, Lionel Messi and opened fire at his family-owned supermarket in his hometown of Rosario in Argentina. Although the Argentina international was not present during the attack, the gunmen left a message which read: “Messi, we’re waiting for you,” according to Metro. The gunmen said in their message, “[Rosario mayor Pablo] Javkin is also a drug trafficker, so he won’t take care of you.” The gunmen were two in number and came on a motorcycle. They fired shots but nobody was injured during the incident at the supermarket – owned by Messi’s wife’s family – Antonella Roccuzzo. Celia Arena, the justice minister for the Santa Fe province, reacted to the attack on social media, She posted: ‘With the mafia attack on the Roccuzzo family’s business, knowing that it will be an event of global significance, the aim is to [install] terror in the population and unease in those of us who are in the battle against criminal violence. It is, neither more nor less, the definition of terrorism.”
