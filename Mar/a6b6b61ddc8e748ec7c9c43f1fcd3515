Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has said their next three fixtures will define their season. Guardiola was speaking after their 2-0 win over Newcastle in Saturday’s early kick-off. Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva scored for the Premier League champions as they kept track with leaders Arsenal. “We played a really good first half and after the game went up and down we put Bernardo on to make our possessions longer, we needed to keep more of the ball. “It’s part of his intuition to do high pressing… “An incredibly good result for us because it was a tricky game. Now we have three games in different competitions before the international break which will define our season,” Guardiola said. City travel to Crystal Palace in the Premier League next Saturday, before hosting RB Leipzig in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on March 14. They then face Burnley in the FA Cup quarter-finals on March 18.
