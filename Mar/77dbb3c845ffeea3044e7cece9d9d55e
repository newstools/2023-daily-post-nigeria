Mr Tony Okocha, a former Chief of Staff to the Rivers State Government and member of the Tinubu/Shettima Presidential Campaign Council in Rivers State, has alleged that former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, voted for the Peoples Democratic Party candidate, Atiku Abubakar, during the February 25 presidential election while he was still a member of the All Progressives Congress, APC. Okocha alleged that the action of Amaechi was the height of anti-party activity, claiming he had long abandoned the party. He disclosed this while speaking to newsmen in Port Harcourt on Sunday. Okocha also claimed that Amaechi is no longer the leader of the APC in Rivers State. Okocha said, “It’s clear cut and certain that our former leader, Rt Hon. Rotimi Amaechi, became the leader of the party on the grounds of him being a serving Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “A day to the presidential election, he ordered his supporters to go and vote for the presidential candidate of the PDP.” “And himself, we’ve it on record that he voted for the candidate of the PDP, Atiku. “That naturally disqualifies him as leader and that I, Okocha, who won the election with my own faction for our presidential candidate, is now the leader of APC in Rivers State.” Recall that Atiku came second in the presidential election. The former Vice President was behind APC’s Bola Tinubu, who won the election with over 8million votes.
