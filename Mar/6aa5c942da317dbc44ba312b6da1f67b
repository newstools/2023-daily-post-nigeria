Chelsea defender, Ben Chilwell has hailed teammate Raheem Sterling, insisting the England international has helped the club on and off the pitch. This is despite the player’s underwhelming first season at Stamford Bridge, especially under Graham Potter. Sterling has scored just four domestic goals for the Blues since his £50m move from Manchester City last summer. Chilwell said the winger has been a valuable member of the Potter’s squad this season. “He’s a brilliant football player, so on the pitch we all kind of knew what we were getting,” Chilwell told Parimatch. “We knew he was going to impact our team with a lot of goalscoring opportunities, with goals and assists. He has a big impact. “He’s brought a lot of experience.”
