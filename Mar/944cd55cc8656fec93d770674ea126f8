Leaders of Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA), on Monday, denied endorsing the Deputy Governor of Kaduna state, Her Excellency, Dr. Hadiza Sabuwa Balarebe, ahead of Saturday’s governorship election and state House of Assembly election. In a statement issued by the ECWA Chairman and the Secretary, Rev. Dr Yunana Tanimu and Rev. Nehemiah Bature, respectively, the group said “the attention of Pastors and leaders of the 21 District Church Council (DCCs) in Kaduna State has been drawn to a misleading news item on the social media alleging that ECWA endorsed the Deputy Governor of Kaduna State, Her Excellency, Dr. Hadiza Sabuwa Balarebe when she met with some clergies parading themselves as executive of the 21 ECWA DCCs.” The statement described the news item as misleading, false, and strange. According to the statement, ECWA, as a non-partisan body, has adopted a neutral stance in the past and forthcoming elections. “But embedded in ECWA’s neutrality, is our total objection to any same faith ticket – either Christian-Christian or Muslim-Muslim ticket – in line with the same objection that the national headquarters of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has expressed,” the statement noted. It reiterated its stance that ECWA has not mandated the impostors to speak for it.
