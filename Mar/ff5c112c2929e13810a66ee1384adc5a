Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has described their 3-2 win over Bournemouth as “madness”. The Gunners came back from two goals down to beat the Cherries at the Emirates and maintain their five-point gap at the top of the table. Phillip Billing and Marcos Senesi gave the visitors a shock 2-0 lead, before Arteta’s men fought back through Thomas Partey, Ben White and Reiss Nelson. “It was madness from the first second. We kept trying and dominating the game. We had a mountain to climb and we took it bit by bit. “We had the hunger to go for the first goal. From then the atmosphere changed. Reiss Nelson hasn’t featured much because he has been injured. He comes on and puts in that performance. It was incredible to experience the emotion with the crowd. It’s going to stick with us,” Arteta told BBC MOTD.
