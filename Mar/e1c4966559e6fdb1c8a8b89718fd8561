Despite the ruling by the Supreme Court, traders, transporters and fuel stations in Kwara State are still rejecting the old N500 and N1000 notes as legal tender. While some fuel stations accepted bank transfers, others insisted on direct cash payments for the purchase of fuel. Complaints by fuel stations range from poor network service to delays in confirming payments by the stations. Findings by DAILY POST further revealed that only a few commercial banks in Ilorin, the state capital, dispensed either the new naira or old N200 notes to the public. Sources at the First Bank informed our correspondent that the bank has shut down temporarily following an alleged hacking of its website, hence the inability to attend to customers. However, customers at the UBA in Ilorin went home with N3,000 cash withdrawals across the counter. In what appeared to be a positive impact of the cashless policy of the federal government, petty traders have started to imbibe the policy by having bank accounts through which customers could pay when purchases are made. However, the only problem confronting the traders presently is how to withdraw the cash needed to buy more products. A meat vendor who spoke to DAILY POST correspondent expressed worry that she has no choice but to collect cash because Fulani cattle dealers donâ€™t believe in bank transfer but in cash.
