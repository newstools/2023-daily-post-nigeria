The delay in the payment of the ad-hoc staff of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has been attributed to irregularities in their account details. Some ad-hoc staff had approached DAILY POST in Taraba over the delay in paying their allowance by the commission. They told our correspondent they would distance themselves from the governorship and State House of Assembly elections slated for March 18. Narrating their ordeals during the last exercise, they expressed dismay at the alleged inability of the Commission to encourage them to participate in the next exercise. But when contacted on Monday in Jalingo, the state capital, the commission said arrangements to begin the payment have commenced. The commission’s voters education desk officer, Olasupo Adeoye, blamed the delay on irregularities in bank details, including omissions of names in their bank details and names not corresponding with account numbers. Adeoye, who said the Commission has been working round the clock to address this, said the ad-hoc staff would be paid their allowance before Saturday’s elections. He also denied the allegations making the rounds that the ruling Peoples Democratic Party PDP, in the state have mapped out plans to collaborate with the Commission to scuttle Saturday’s polls. Adeoye described the allegations as false, stating that ” such can not be possible because the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS), has addressed the whole thing”. He urged the public to disregard the allegations as the Commission will not cease from treading every legitimate path to create a level playing field for all the candidates and their political parties.
