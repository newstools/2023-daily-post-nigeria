The Presidential Campaign Council of Mr Peter Obi and Yusuf Datti of the Labour Party in Akwa Ibom State said it has enough evidence to show that its party convincingly won the February 25 presidential election in the state. The Director-General of the PCC Capt. Augustine Okon, at a joint press conference with the leadership of Civil Society Organisations on Friday, expressed confidence that the mandate given to Peter Obi, during the just concluded Presidential Elections would be recovered through legal means. Earlier Peter Obi had while addressing a world press conference in Abuja on Thursday said he was ready to engage in a legal battle to retrieve his mandate. The PCC however expressed reservation for the failure of INEC to upload results to IReV portal despite assurance by its chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, adding that resorting to manual collation and announcement of results not only gave room for suspicion but an indication of a ‘grand gang up’ to suppress the will of the people. His words, “I want to assure you that the PCC Akwa Ibom State has collated enough evidence to prove that, His Excellency, Peter Obi,won the presidential election in this state. We shall liase with our legal team to ensure that the stolen mandate is recovered.” In their separate remarks, the leaders of the Coalition Comrades Nathaniel Ifot, and Bernard Titus, tackled INEC for failing to honour its promise of delivering credible, free and fair elections. Comrade Titus on his part, regretted that votes at his unit in Ini Local Government were allegedly upturned against the LP but urged the people to be steadfast and ensure that all LP candidates in March 11, governorship and House of Assembly polls are voted for.
