Senator Dino Melaye of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, of imputing wrong figures while transferring results to the backend server. Melaye, a spokesperson to the presidential candidate of the PDP in the just concluded February 25 election, Atiku Abubakar, disclosed this in a post via his Twitter handle on Monday. He said his party would expose any wrong imputation and change in figures by the commission as it transfers election results to the backend server. Recall that the Electoral Commission recently obtained order from the Court to allow it reconfigure the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System, BVAS, for the March 18 gubernatorial election. However, the former lawmaker said they would shock INEC and its ICT department. “INEC is doing the wrong thing, wrong imputation going on. We will expose any wrong imputation and figures changing as upload and backend transfer is going on. We will shock INEC and the ICT department. Jail loading for many,” he tweeted.
