A group of aggrieved Nigerian youths invaded the office of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, in Minna, the capital of Niger State, over alleged irregularities during last Saturday’s polls. The group numbering about 100 stormed INEC’s office and protested over what they described as ‘rigged’ election results in Niger State. They carried placards with various inscriptions such as “Taxpayers money wasted,” “We can’t continue like this, ” “INEC Chairman a disappointment,” and “This is Election is Fraud,” among others. The protesters, who were not deterred by the presence of security personnel, queried the electoral body on why the presidential election results were not transmitted electronically to the INEC result viewing portal. INEC’s Secretary of Administration, Yakubu Doko addressing them on behalf of the Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Alhaji Ahmed Yusha’u Garki, assured the angry youths that whatever the headquarters of INEC says will be communicated in due course. He stated: “INEC is transparent, we are open. We have nothing to hide, but for clarifications on the uploading of results, we will wait to hear from the INEC headquarters in Abuja.” The leader of the group, Mike Junior, said: “Our anger is the result. We demand an IReV result, electronically transmitted results, the ones Prof Mahmood Yakubu promised us that made us come out to cast our votes. “From the polling units to wards to area councils to the states. So, that’s what we demand. We will not take rigging for an answer. We need original results.”
