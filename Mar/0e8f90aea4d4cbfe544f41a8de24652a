According to the charge read out in court, Igwe is alleged to have been in possession of $498, 100 on February 24, 2023, during a police stop-and-search operation. When the charge was read, the accused pleaded not guilty. His counsel, however, made an application for bail which was objected to by the police counsel. Trial judge, Justice Stephen Daylop-Pam after listening to the argument, adjourned till March 14, 2023, for bail consideration. He, thereafter, directed that the accused should be sent to Nigerian Police Clinic for medical attention.
