The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi has said he is challenging Bola Tinubu’s victory at the February 25 presidential election. Obi, while appearing on Arise TV on Monday, claimed he was not interested in challenging the “outcome” of the election. The former Governor of Anambra insisted he wants to contest the process leading to INEC’s declaration of Tinubu as the president-elect. “Following my response to a question while appearing on Arise TV earlier today, I want to state categorically that at the Presidential Elections Tribunal (PET), I am challenging the INEC electoral process that led to the declaration of Tinubu as president-elect as well as the declaration itself,” Obi tweeted Tinubu was declared as the winner of the election on March 1. Obi has since gone to court, alleging irregularities by the electoral commission. Consequently, the Appeal Court granted leave to access all the sensitive materials used for the election. —
