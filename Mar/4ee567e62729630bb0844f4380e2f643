Hajiya Kulu Abdullahi, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Women Leader in Sokoto State, has defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) ahead of March 11 governorship and state assembly elections in the state. This development was contained in a statement issued by Mr Bashar Abubakar, the Special Assistant, Media and Publicity to Sen. Aliyu Wamakko (APC-Sokoto North) on Wednesday. According to the statement, Abdullahi, the PDP North West Women Forum Chairperson, was warmly received by Wamakko, the APC leader in the state assisted by the partyâ€™s governorship candidate, Alhaji Ahmed Aliyu. He said the former women leader wrote a letter to the state PDP Chairman, dated March 6, hinging her defection on protracted non-reconciliatory issues bedeviling the party in the state. The special assistant quoted Wamakko, while receiving the new APC members, as assuring her of equal treatment like any other member of the party for the overall development of all.
