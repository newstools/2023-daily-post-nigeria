The Labour Party governorship candidate in Kaduna State, Jonathan Asake, has called for calm in Atyap chiefdom, Zangon Kataf Local Government Area, following an attack on Saturday night on Ungwan Wakili village that claimed 17 lives. Expressing shock at the attack, Asake, through his media aide, James Swam, condoled the bereaved families and those that sustained injuries while he prayed for the repose of the souls of the departed and quick recovery for those injured. He also called on Governor Nasir el-Rufai to muster the political will to solve the lingering cases of incessant Killings in the local government in particular and the state in general. Asake decried a situation where innocent old men and women as well as little children would be attacked and killed in their sleep, describing such as a barbaric act that should never be condoned in any sane society under the rule of law. He lamented that the attack, suspected to have been carried out by terrorists who continually invade and displace helpless and defenceless communities with impunity, has become a regular affair in the communities around the local government. The Labour Party governorship candidate urged the Kaduna State government to act fast against the perpetrators of last Saturday’s crime to serve as a deterrent to other criminal elements in the society, and to forestall reprisal in other communities. “The security agencies must swing into action immediately by arresting and prosecuting those criminal bandits suspected to have murdered the 17 villagers in Ungwan Wakili of Zangon Kataf Local Government Area,” Asake said. According to him, it is only when the long arm of the law is seen to have acted against criminality that criminals would fear committing crimes. He appealed to the various communities in the local government to live in peace and harmony irrespective of ethnicity and religion, saying this is the only panacea to development.
