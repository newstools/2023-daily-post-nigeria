Rangers players have been charged to go all out for a win when they take on holders Rivers United in a rescheduled Nigeria Premier Football League game on Wednesday. Rivers United have enjoyed good results in the CAF Confederation Cup in recent weeks. The Pride of Rivers will shift focus to the defence of their NPFL title when they do battle with Rangers at the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium, Port Harcourt, in midweek. Rangers secretary, Ferdinand Ugwuarua, tasked his players to beat Rivers United in front of their fans. “We are going to Port Harcourt to get the maximum three points in this game,” Ugwuarua stated during a chat with the team before they departed Enugu on Monday. “We are not scared about the form Rivers United are on currently. We have what it takes to beat them.” The seven-time champions currently occupy the ninth position on the Group B table.
