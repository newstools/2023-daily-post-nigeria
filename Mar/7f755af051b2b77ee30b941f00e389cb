President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness over the fire incident that engulfed the Akere Spare Parts Market on Kirikiri Road, Akere Bus Stop, Olodi-Apapa in Ajegunle on Wednesday morning. The President also expressed deep sadness over the death of a 65-year-old security guard and the loss of properties and means of livelihood of some Nigerians at the Akere Spare Parts market, Lagos. Buhari sympathized with the traders and their families, who bear the brunt of this sad, unfortunate incident. The president is equally concerned that a similar fire incident occurred at the popular Balogun market some weeks ago, calling on relevant authorities to take precautions to stem the tide. This was disclosed in a statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu. Buhari, however, commended the Lagos State Fire Service for responding to the incident, salvaging a nearby filling station with a 33,000 litres PMS tanker, amongst other adjoining buildings.
