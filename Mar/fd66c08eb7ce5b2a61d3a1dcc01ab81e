Arsenal legend, Ian Wright, has said Liverpool will likely miss out on a top four spot in the Premier League. According to Wright, “you can’t trust” Jurgen Klopp’s side. The Reds lost 1-0 at Bournemouth just six days after they demolished Manchester United 7-0 at Anfield. It continued an erratic campaign, which has seen Liverpool lose against Leeds, Nottingham Forest, Wolves, Brighton and Brentford in the league. Klopp’s side are currently sitting in sixth place on the table, six points off fourth-placed Tottenham, who have played one game more. Wright told Premier League productions: “I think Tottenham are going to be okay simply because they have got Harry Kane. He’s going to score goals. “You look at Newcastle. They are missing chances. Yes, they scored a couple and it was good for them, but they will have to do that with their two games in hand. They have to score goals. I can’t see Tottenham not scoring goals.”
