The Oyo State council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) has said that it is not in any way in support, nor has it anointed any of the gubernatorial candidates in the state. The union said that it remained neutral as a professional body. It made these disclosures in a communique issued at the end of one of its congresses on Friday. The union in the communique prepared by the trio of Seye Ojo, Funmbi Bello and Amos Oladimeji and made available to DAILY POST by the union’s secretary, Sola Oladapo, tasked the electorate to beware of the fifth columnist and fake news ahead of the March 11, 2023 election. It added that it will continue to uphold the ethics and principles guiding the journalism profession at all times. The NUJ enjoined the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to correct all anomalies reported during the last presidential and national assembly elections. The union further advised politicians to play the game according to the rules. “That NUJ, as a body, does not have an anointed candidate for the Saturday, March 11, 2023, governorship poll in Oyo State. “We urge INEC to correct all anomalies reported during the last election on February 25, 2023 and ensure the gubernatorial poll is better organized with the expected outcomes to be free, fair, transparent and credible,” it said.
