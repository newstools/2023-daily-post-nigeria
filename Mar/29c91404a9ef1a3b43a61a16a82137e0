The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has said the issues with the result viewing portal have been rectified ahead of the March 18 gubernatorial elections. INEC had promised to upload results from polling units during the February 25 presidential elections in real-time. However, the IReV portal remained inactive for a long time, even after voting was finished in some polling units. INEC National Commissioner, Festus Okoye, speaking on Channels Television on Sunday, disclosed the electoral body had activated a second option in case they have issues with uploading of results. “So we have made the necessary amendments, we have learned the necessary lessons from this and we have also activated an option B in terms of how we approach the issue of result upload. “If we have any challenge relating to the uploading of polling unit results, the ICT knows what to do so that we don’t have the type of challenge we had during the presidential election,” Okoye said.
