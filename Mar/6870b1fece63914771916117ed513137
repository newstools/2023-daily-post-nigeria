The Action Alliance (AA) has denied endorsing any gubernatorial candidate in Kaduna State. AA said that the announcement by Mohammed Lawal Kayahaya, was fraudulent and not from the party. The National Secretary of AA, Ambassador Suleiman Abdulrashid, the party’s National Secretary, while briefing newsmen in Kaduna on Saturday, explained that AA was not in alliance with any party, saying that it is preparing very well for the March 18 governorship and House of Assembly elections in the state. According to him, “Mohammed Lawal Kayahaya is not the state gubernatorial candidate of AA, therefore, warned Ashiru and others to be wary of people like him with sinister motives.” He added that Kayahaya is playing the script of the expelled former National Chairman of the party, Barr. Kenneth Udenze, who was recently in Adamawa State to endorse Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, after doing so with another presidential aspirant. Ambassador Abdulrashid called on security agents to go after Kayahaya and his associates for using the name of the party without authorization to satisfy their selfish desires to the detriment of the party. He called on the party supporters to remain calm and wait for further directives from the national Secretariat of the party that would be issued before the March 18 gubernatorial and state assembly elections.
