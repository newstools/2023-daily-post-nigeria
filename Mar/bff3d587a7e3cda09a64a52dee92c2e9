The General Overseer of Goshen Freedom Tabernacle, GFT, in Effurun, Uvwie Local Government Area of Delta State, Prophet Austin Ariole JP, on Sunday told the opposition who lost that no Court would upturn the 2023 presidential results in their favour. The cleric made the assertion during a sermon on Sunday. Prophet Ariole said Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu had been declared the winner of the election by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, and there is nothing anyone could do about it. While noting that he is not a supporter of any of the presidential candidates, Prophet Ariole said the opposition would not obtain any judgement to upturn the results. According to him, “There’s no Court that can deliver that judgement. The tribunal cannot. The cabal control the Court.” He added that the opposition should just allow the president-elect, as well as the result by INEC stay, saying, “There’s nothing anyone could do about it “. It would be recalled that the Presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Mr. Peter Obi, as well as that of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, had approached the Court to contest the 2023 presidential election result after INEC declared Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress, APC, winner and president-elect of the just concluded election which held on February 25.
