Former Italy international, Antonio Cassano, has tipped former Chelsea manager, Jose Mourinho, to make a sensational return to the Premier League giants if the Blues decide to sack Graham Potter. Potter has endured a hard start to life at Chelsea as they have won just one of their last eleven matches in all competitions. Chelsea sits in 10th position in the Premier League table, with 14 points adrift of fourth position Tottenham Hotspur. Chelsea have decided to stick by Potter, who is currently under intense pressure at Stamford Bridge, but the bookies have earmarked the Englishman as the most likely manager to be sacked next in the Premier League. “If Inzaghi were to be fired, I would rule out the return of Jose Mourinho [to Inter Milan],” Cassano told Bobo TV. “If an offer from the Premier League were to arrive, the Special One [Jose Mourinho] would choose England. “The fans fell in love with his attitude [in Italy], but he intends to leave, and for me, he can only go back to Chelsea.”
