The Petroleum Product Retail Outlet owners Association of Nigeria, PETROAN, says the illegal extortion from retail outlet owners around the country, by Community Development Committees, CDC, across the country, affects the price of petrol in filling stations. The national president of PETROAN, Billy Gillis-Harry, during a press conference in Port Harcourt, said every payment impacts the cost of landing. He called on CDCs nationwide to desist from illegal extortion from its members. Gillis-Harry also called on the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, NMDPRA, to “sustain the priority loading scheme that has commenced with PETROAN members and other retail outlets.” He noted that if marketers get products later than scheduled, selling petrol at N205 per litre as recommended by the NMDPRA will become difficult. On the naira redesign, Gillis-Harry said the scarcity of the naira is affecting the distribution of products to different states. He said: “The naira reprint that has come up is a major challenge to us. It is affecting product distribution in the station because, every time one customer is served, payment becomes a challenge. Especially when he has to look for cash or has to do a transfer. “Transfers cannot be done and then the driver runs away. They must be there to make sure the transfers are effected and that takes a long time. “For that reason, we want the CBN to work closely with us on their new technology on the eNaira. The eNaira will be the best option for Nigerians. Most of our members are willing to work with that eNaira technology.” On his part, the Zonal Chairman for System 2E, Sunny Nkpe, assured that PETROAN is currently working on partnering with NMDPRA to ensure the availability of petroleum products in the country. Nkpe advised Nigerians not to panic-buy especially during this election period, adding that they are working to ensure an adequate supply of petrol.
