The gubernatorial candidate of the Accord party in Oyo State, Adebayo Adelabu has maintained he is not stepping down for anyone in the forthcoming election. Adelabu made this declaration in a statement issued by Bayo Adelabu Campaign Organisation (BACO) on Saturday. Adelabu in the statement made available to DAILY POST on Saturday insisted there was no time he met with anyone where he said that he would step down for anyone. He described the rumour that he has stepped down in the forthcoming election as fake and unfortunate, saying those spreading the rumour were enemies of the state. Adding that the sponsors of the fake news are those jittery of his popularity, he maintained that those who are spreading the rumour are people whose political careers are built on falsehood and manipulations. The former Deputy Governor (Operations) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) maintained that the people of the state are already aware of the antics of some politicians which cannot take them anywhere in the governorship election. The Accord candidate noted that his doors are open to anyone who wished to liberate the state. “We want to inform the good people of Oyo State that there was no time Chief Adebayo Adelabu held any meetings with any candidates or political parties with a view to stepping down. This was another lie from a political schizophrenic whose political career was built on falsehood and manipulations. Chief Adebayo Adelabu is not stepping down for anyone. “My focus is on getting electorates to know where their fingerprint will go on March 11. Adelabu is contesting to win the gubernatorial election in Oyo state under Accord and our door is open to any candidate who wish to join us in liberating the state”.
