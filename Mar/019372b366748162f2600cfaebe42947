A socio-political activist, Deji Adeyanju, has disclosed why the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, didn’t resign from his position. Adeyanju claimed that Ayu refused to yield to calls for his resignation because he believed the PDP’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, could not win the 2023 election. Atiku had lost the 2023 presidential election to Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress, APC. The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, declared Tinubu president-elect after polling 8,794,726 votes to win the 2023 presidential election to defeat Atiku with 6,984,520 votes. Labour Party’s Peter Obi had 6,101,533 votes to come third and candidate of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) Rabiu Kwankwaso with 1,496,687 votes. However, Adeyanju said Ayu would reactivate his friendship with Tinubu following the conclusion of the presidential election. Adeyanju tweeted: “Ayu didn’t resign because he didn’t believe Atiku could win. He will now reactivate his friendship with Tinubu to sabotage PDP every step of the way. “Imagine having a National Chairman and National Secretary of opposition that are in cohort with the president.”
