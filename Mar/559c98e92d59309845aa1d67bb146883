The All Progressives Congress in Bende Local Government Area, Abia State, has applauded the reelection of the former governor of the state and representative of Abia North senatorial district at the National Assembly, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu. Kalu secured another term in office at the just concluded February 25 presidential and senatorial polls conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC. Kalu garnered 30, 805 votes to defeat his major opponents, Mao Ohuabunwa of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, who polled 15, 175 votes and Nnamdi Iroh of the Labour Party who had 25,540 votes. Kalu was declared the winner of the Abia North senatorial zone election at the Ohafia collation centre by INEC’s returning officer, Chinedu Nnamdi. The chairman of the Abia Local Government Area chapter of the All Progressives Congress, Prince Ulu Onwuchekwa, in a statement on Thursday, said the party is overwhelmed by the electoral victory of Kalu, who is the current Majority Chief Whip of the Senate. Onwuchekwa described Kalu’s triumph in the recently-conducted senatorial poll in Abia North district as well deserved. The APC leadership, according to him, commended members of the party and the electorate across all electoral wards of the local government areas under the Abia North senatorial zone for reaffirming their trust in one of the finest leaders through the ballots. The party also reaffirmed its unwavering belief in Senator Kalu’s character, capacity and competence to represent the senatorial zone in the yet-to-be-inaugurated 10th Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Appealing to all politicians to sheath their swords and work for the common good of the zone, Onwuchekwa said: “To opponent and political fraternal comrades who just lost out, we at APC Bende LGA appreciate your doggedness and participation which helped to enrich and virilize the democratic space and we urge you to accept your defeat with equanimity and stoicism and to rally support for Senator Orji Uzor Kalu.”
