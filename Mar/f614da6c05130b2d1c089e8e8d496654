The Labour Party presidential candidate in the just concluded February 25 presidential election, Peter Obi, has paid a visit to Jennifer Efedi who was attacked by hoodlums during the election. One of the spokespersons for the Obi-Datti Presidential Campaign Council, Ndi Kato, disclosed this on Monday via her Twitter handle. Recall that Efedi was attacked by hoodlums in Lagos during the presidential election and sustained injuries in the process. Her resilience to cast vote amidst the pains of the injuries she sustained attracted her commendations and applause from the well-spirited Nigerians. Kato revealed that though the political season had been torturous, she hoped they would get through it together. “A leader like no other. Peter Obi visited Mrs Jennifer Efedi who was attacked on the 25th of January while trying to cast her vote. This has really been a torturous season but we will get through it together,” she tweeted.
