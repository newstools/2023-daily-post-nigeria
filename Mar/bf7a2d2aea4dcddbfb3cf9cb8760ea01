Femi Fani-Kayode, a member of the All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council, has reacted to claims by the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, that he won Saturday’s election. On Thursday, Obi declared that he actually won the 2023 presidential election. The Labour Party flagbearer said he was robbed of his mandate, adding that he would reclaim it in a court of law. Obi said this during his first media briefing after the Saturday presidential and National Assembly elections. The Labour Party candidate who came third had 6, 101,533 votes, while Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party had 6,984,520 and Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress was declared the winner. Reacting, Fani-Kayode tweeted: “Peter the Pooh says he won the election? Wonders never cease! Now I know where the Obidients get their mass delusion & hypnotic psychosis from. “Can someone tell this poor, lost soul to stop shedding tears on national television? He can leave that to Datti the Daft: he is good at it.”
