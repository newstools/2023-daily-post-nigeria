EDITED- Former England man, Rio Ferdinand has reckoned that Nigeria international, Victor Osimhen will join Chelsea when the transfer window reopens in June. He also believes that England captain Harry Kane tops Manchester United’s striker list. Osimhen, Kane and Benfica’s Goncalo Ramos are the three strikers in Erik ten Hag wishlist for the summer transfer as United prioritise signing a new striker Chelsea also are in need of a new striker with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang having flopped since joining from Barcelona in the summer of 2022. The Blues have also been credited with interest in Osimhen. Erik ten Hag is said to have made Kane his first choice target and Ferdinand expects Stanford Bridge to be the destination for Osimhen this summer. “I reckon Chelsea this summer will go for Osimhen,” Ferdinand told Five. “Man United are going for Harry Kane. Harry Kane isn’t going to Chelsea from Spurs, no chance.” Ferdinand further demanded from Kane to make the decision about his future clear. “But you have to ask him the question, that is the question we need answering from him. Tell us man, ‘I want to be a one club man, I want to have the statue outside, I’m Mr Spurs’. We will all say, well played, that’s fine,” he added.
