Famous Nollywood actor and film director, Yul Chibuike Daniel Edochie, popularly known as Yul Edochie, has stated that the Igbo-speaking part of Nigeria has largely contributed to the growth of Lagos State. He said it was wrong to describe Lagos as no man’s land because the Yoruba people have been accommodating. Speaking in a post on his Instagram page on Saturday, the actor explained that it was well known that the Igbo, including other tribes, had also contributed to Lagos State. He wrote: “I’ve lived in Lagos since 2011. I built my house there. Not have I experienced any form of rejection or hate from the Lagosians. “Anytime Yoruba boys see me on the street, they gather to greet me, and it’s all love always. And this talk flying around that Lagos is a no man’s land is wrong. “Lagos is a Yoruba state in Yoruba land. Imagine anyone calling Anambra a no-man’s land. That’s crap. Anambra is an Igbo land. You are looking for trouble if you come into someone’s land and tell the person it’s now a no man’s land. “Igbos’ immense contribution to Lagos development is undeniable. Other tribes also contributed in their own ways too. And the Yoruba as well have been largely accommodating. It shouldn’t take away the fact that Lagos is a Yoruba land. We are not dragging ownership. Let’s kill tribalism before it kills us.”
