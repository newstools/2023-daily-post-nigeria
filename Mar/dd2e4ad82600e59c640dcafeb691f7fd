Former House of Representatives Speaker Yakubu Dogara has refuted claims that he’s back in the All Progressives Congress, APC. The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, chieftain on Monday responded to an enquiry by DAILY POST. “It’s complicated. I am supporting candidates not parties,” Dogara replied. Dogara was at the weekend seen with the APC governorship candidate in Bauchi State, Sadique Abubakar. The 63-year-old retired Air Marshal was Nigeria’s Chief of Air Staff from July 2015 to January 2021. Dogara is being courted by politicians because he played a major role in the PDP’s defeat of the APC in the 2015 gubernatorial poll. He commands large followership, which helped a protégé in the APC, Jafaru Gambo Leko, emerge victorious at the February 25 national assembly election. The young politician won the Bogoro/Dass/Tafawa Balewa Federal Constituency seat, which Dogara occupied from 2007 to 2019. “They procured thugs to attack us and stole BVAS from some polling units, but regardless, a protégé of the one they wanted to forcibly retire will succeed him. “We took a righteous stance based on justice, fairness and accommodation for all regardless of tribe/creed and the God of justice showed up,” Dogara tweeted after Leko’s victory. The former lawmaker defected to the PDP last year in protest of the Bola Tinubu-Kashim Shettima Muslim-Muslim ticket of the APC. Others who opposed it were ex-Secretary to the Government of the Federation Babachir Lawal, and Senator Elisha Abbo, among others.
