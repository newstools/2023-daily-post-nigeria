The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, at the weekend said it would start the presentation of Certificates of Return to elected members of the National Assembly on Tuesday. The INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, stated this during a meeting with the commission’s Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) in Abuja on Saturday. Yakubu explained the members-elect of the House of Representatives would be presented their certificates on Wednesday, while senators-elect would receive theirs on Tuesday. The INEC boss said: “However, for effective crowd management, each Senator/Member-elect should be accompanied by a maximum of two guests. “The comprehensive list of all members-elect will be uploaded to the Commission’s website shortly.”
