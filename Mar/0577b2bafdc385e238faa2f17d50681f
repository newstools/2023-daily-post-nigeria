Leicester City forward, Kelechi Iheanacho was disappointed to see the Foxes exit the Emirates FA Cup. Iheanacho was on target in Leicester City’s 2-1 defeat to Blackburn Rovers at the King Power Stadium. Brendan Rodgers’ side were the overwhelming favourites to win the second Round of 16 contest but were stunned by the visitors. Blackburn Rovers led 2-0 before Iheanacho reduced the deficit. The 26-year-old has now scored 18 goals in 24 appearances in the competition. The Nigeria international could not hide his disappointment after the game. I am so disappointed, I don’t even have the words now especially because we were at home,” Iheanacho told LCTV. “We did our bit but it was not enough. If you don’t do what you have to do, you get punished. We just have to look forward to the Premier League and do better.”  Leicester City will face Southampton in a Premier League clash this weekend.
