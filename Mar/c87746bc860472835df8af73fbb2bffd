Manchester City legend, Yaya Toure, has insisted that he watches Arsenal’s matches every weekend because of midfielder Thomas Partey. Toure described Partey as an unbelievable player, adding that the Ghanaian international is just brilliant. Partey’s Arsenal career has been regularly blighted by injuries, although the former Atletico Madrid star missed key games over the last month. But his return to Mikel Arteta’s side against Everton and Bournemouth has coincided with a run of seven goals from two matches. “Yeah, he is brilliant, it is really nice to see,” Toure told talkSPORT. “I think now, every weekend when Arsenal have to play, I have to be honest, I would go just to watch him. He is just unbelievable.”
