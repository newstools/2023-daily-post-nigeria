Comedian, Oluwaseyitan Aletile, popularly known as Seyi Law, has tendered an apology to followers and supporters of opposition parties he offended during his campaign for the president elect, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. This is coming after the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, declared the All Progressive Congress, APC, presidential candidate as the winner of Saturday’s election. The Comedian, who, in a post shared on his Instagram page on Wednesday, expressed his happiness about how people are passionate towards their preferred candidates, stated that Nigerians should not develop bitterness and hatred towards one another. “My fellow Nigerians, I’m happy you are as passionate as you are about your preferred candidates. That is the way politics should be. However, hatred and bitterness towards each other shouldn’t have a place between us. “You might not see things the way I see it. That doesn’t mean I’m right and you are wrong. It just means that we are different. If your candidates had won, I would have prayed and worked for their successes and mine. “I apologise to those offended by my support. I seriously condemn all the violence across Nigeria. I have mixed feelings for your genuine anger and not for my candidate’s winning. I, however, pray that Nigerians’ lives get better,” he said.
