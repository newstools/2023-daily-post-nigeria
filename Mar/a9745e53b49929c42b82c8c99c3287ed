The Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III, has described the victory of Nigeria’s President-Elect, Bola Tinubu, in the just concluded presidential election as the work of God. Abubakar said Tinubu’s victory was the act of God Almighty. The Sultan of Sokoto spoke yesterday at the coronation of the new Emir of Dutse in Jigawa State, Alhaji Hameem Nuhu Sanusi. The monarch urged Nigerians to accept the outcome of the 2023 presidential election. He urged Nigerians to support their leaders because they “can’t fight God’s making.” “Leadership is from Allah Almighty given to whoever He wishes at any time He wishes and nobody can query Him or change what He did. “God Almighty did what He wished. We should consider it an act of God. He made the winners and nobody can stop or change what God Almighty did,” he said. Tinubu had defeated his close rival, Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and Peter Obi of the Labour Party, LP, after polling the highest number of votes.
