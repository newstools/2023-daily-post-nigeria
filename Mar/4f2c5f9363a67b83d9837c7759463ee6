Ahead of Saturday’s governorship election, the Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate, Peter Obi on Tuesday urged the Obidients to campaign for the party’s governorship candidates in Nasarawa, Lagos, Enugu, Abia, Delta, Edo, Rivers, Plateau, and Borno States. Obi urged the Obidients to vote for LP candidates in all the states during Saturday’s governorship and State Assembly elections. He made the call while lamenting over his inability to campaign for the party’s candidates across the country. In a series of tweets, Obi wrote: ”I am supposed to commence our whistle-stop campaign for our various Labour Party Governorship and State Assembly Candidates today. Initially, my trip was to take me to Nasarawa, Lagos, Enugu, Abia, Delta, Edo, Rivers, Plateau, Borno, etc. ”However, following INEC’s refusal to allow our party to inspect the materials (including BVAS) from the 25th February presidential elections, I am personally heading to the Court today with our lawyers. ”As we pursue due process and defer to the rule of law, I urge all the Obidients in the various states to continue campaigning for our candidates, namely, Gbadebo Rhodes Vivour in Lagos, Chijioke Edeoga in Enugu, Patrick Dakum in Plateau, Alex Otti in Abia, Ken Pela in Delta, Ibrahim Mshelia in Borno, to name just a few.”
