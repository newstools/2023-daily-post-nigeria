Manchester United’s players chatted about reeling in Arsenal and Manchester City, before they were hammered 7-0 by Liverpool on Sunday, dealing them a reality check. The Red Devils only conceded once in the first half, but allowed six goals after the break as Jurgen Klopp’s men ran riot at Anfield. It was a shocking result for United who came into the game with good form. Erik ten Hag’s men had defeated Newcastle 2-0 the previous week to lift the Carabao Cup – their first piece of silverware for six years. The Daily Mail reports that, on their squad WhatsApp chat, the players spoke about catching up with City and Arsenal, who have set the pace for much of the season. Optimism had been growing but the heavy loss on Merseyside all but kills any slender hopes they had of challenging for the title.
