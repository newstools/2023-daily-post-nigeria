A human rights activist, Israel Joe has commended the Labour Party, LP and its presidential candidate, Peter Obi for seeking legal redress over the alleged fraudulent presidential election held recently. Warning that the court of law goes side by side with evidence and facts, Joe said, “What was seen and experienced during the election was not enough to cancel the elections until it is transmuted into raw sizeable facts and presentable evidence.” In a press statement, the activist urged political parties in Nigeria to create websites with large databases where Nigerians can upload tested and accredited original copies of results and evidence from the Polling Units to Ward and Local Government levels and subsequently submit hardcopies at their disposal to the parties. According to Joe, “Pictures and videos of violence across Nigeria, especially those where security forces, INEC Nigeria, politicians and other anti-Democratic actors were seen in action, should also be uploaded to the website, along with location, time and date.” He opined that “This will enable Nigerians to test the transparent powers of the judiciary and return the power of the presidency to the people of Nigeria according to the justice-able rulings of the court.”
