A coroner’s inquest into the death of a Lagos-based chef, Mrs Peju Ugboma has determined that her death was avoidable. Giving his verdict on Thursday in Lagos, the Coroner, Chief Magistrate Mukaila Fadeyi said Peju died after medical negligence. Ugboma died on April 25, 2021, after undergoing hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) to remove fibroids. The surgery was done 48 hours earlier at the Premier Medical Centre in the Lekki area of the state. Ugboma was transferred to Evercare Hospital due to complications but she was pronounced dead shortly after. The coroner said an autopsy revealed that the deceased died from massive intra-abdominal bleeding, as 500ml of blood and 900ml of clotted blood were found in her abdomen, NAN reports. Fadeyi observed that the deceased’s medical history was poorly documented and that doctors of Premier Medical Centre failed to engage appropriate surgeons. He questioned the absence of vital machines and unwillingness of the doctors to address the issues immediately after surgery. The coroner recommended that state governments should not limit funds to public hospitals but extend funding to private hospitals. “Government and medical regulators should ensure that the standards by the World Health Organisation for Packed-Cell Volume (PCV) of 38 per cent before any surgical operation should be maintained,” he added. Fadeyi added that he could not award damages as requested by counsel to the Ugboma Family, noting that he only carried out an inquest.
