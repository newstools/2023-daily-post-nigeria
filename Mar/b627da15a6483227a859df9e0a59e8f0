The Croatian star told GOAL: “I was only 21 years old, and there were some big players but, in the beginning, I was a little bit nervous. “I learned a lot and there [Real Madrid] are a lot of great characters. Of course, with my relationship with Luka [Modric], he was one of the leaders there and then you had upfront Ronaldo. He was a leader on and off the pitch. “My relationship with all the players is amazing, especially with Luka [Modric]. He was my idol when I was a child and then when I came to Madrid, we obviously connected more and now we share this friendship. It is amazing to have such a big player and a big person as a friend.
