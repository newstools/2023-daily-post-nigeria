Governor Aminu Tambuwal’s wife, Mariya has called for peaceful conduct of the March 18 governorship and house of assembly election. On Saturday, Prof. Aisha Madawaki, Commissioner for Higher Education, represented Mariya at the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, rally in Sokoto South Senatorial District. At the event organised by the Women Wing, Tambuwal’s wife thanked women for coming out massively to vote on February 25th and advised them to monitor their children to ensure they are not used as political thugs. “We should monitor their activities in order not to be deceived into violence by desperate politicians,” NAN quoted. “Any politician who asks them to create violence should be told to align with his children in carrying out the task.” The governor’s spouse further charged the electorate to remain peaceful and stand firm on Saturday during and after voting. Mariya added that the PDP is a party “built with the mission of peace and peaceful coexistence” and therefore must be law-abiding.
