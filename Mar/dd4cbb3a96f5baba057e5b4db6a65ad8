President Muhammadu Buhari, on Friday, said sacrifices of the Armed Forces remain appreciated by Nigerians. Buhari commended the patriotic role the armed forces played in maintaining law and order during last Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections. The President, who virtually commissioned 700 Ashok Leyland Troop Carrying Vehicles assembled in Lagos, from Daura, Katsina State, promised more support for the welfare of the military personnel while assuring that their “labour will not be in vain”. Buhari said, “I wish to commend the resolve of our armed forces towards the defeat of insurgency and its support in maintaining law and order as was demonstrated in the just concluded Presidential and National Assembly elections. “I want to assure you all that your labour will not be in vain. The Administration will continue to support you in every respect, including improving your welfare.” Buhari also said the war against terrorism and criminality in Nigeria would be sustained and boosted with supplies of hardware and better care for the security outfits.
