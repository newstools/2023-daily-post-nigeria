Conference of Nigeria Political Parties (CNPP) at the weekend called on the international community to hold the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, responsible for the observable manipulations of the collation process, especially the presidential election conducted on February 25. CNPP also called on the Nigerian judiciary to give justice to all electoral petitions by aggrieved political parties in the February 25 Presidential and National Assembly elections, appealing to the Judges and Justices to do better than the INEC. In a statement signed by Chief Willy Ezugwu, CNPP’s Secretary General, the group also warned that the present peace of the graveyard in the country must not be abused. The CNPP statement read in part, “But it’s shocking that INEC failed to upload the results to its IREV servers even in urban cities where there were sufficient Internet network connections across the country. “We, therefore, call on the international community and lovers of democracy across the world to hold the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, responsible for the observable manipulations of the collation process, especially the presidential election.” DAILY POST reports that APC’s Bola Tinubu won the 2023 Presidential election. The former Lagos State governor defeated PDP’s Atiku Abubakar and LP’s Peter Obi.
