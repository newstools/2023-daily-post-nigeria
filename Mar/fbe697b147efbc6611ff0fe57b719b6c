National Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Samuel Nnaemeka Anyanwu on Monday expressed displeasure over the existence of saboteurs in the party in Imo State, adding that all their efforts are tailored towards the liquidation of PDP in the state. Anyanwu said the primary objective of the alleged saboteurs during the just concluded presidential and National Assembly elections was to starve the party and its members of funds earlier approved and released as election intervention funds. The PDP scribe stated this in a statement, signed by the Special Adviser (Media) to the National Secretary of PDP, Ikenna Onuoha, made available to DAILY POST in Owerri, Imo State capital. He regretted that all entreaties, appeals and convictions to release the funds approved to appropriate authorities in line with the national template to enable them to deliver candidates of the party were flagrantly ignored, noting that the ulterior motive of the saboteurs was to frustrate PDP by ensuring that its candidates lose the election. According to him: “After hijacking the election intervention funds released to the party in Imo State, some of the saboteurs turned against candidates of PDP and played anti-party [politics] in order to justify the deal they had with leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC).” The PDP national scribe, therefore, called on the party’s candidates and other aggrieved members who were betrayed by saboteurs to remain calm, assuring that all legal means shall be utilized to bring those directly and indirectly involved to book. While assuring them of efforts to revive the party and make it more viable and formidable ahead of the November 11 governorship election, Anyanwu expresses optimism that those that betrayed PDP will soon be exposed in public.
