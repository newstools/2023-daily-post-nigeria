The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, has said the President-elect, Bola Tinubu’s campaign team admitted they rigged last Saturday’s presidential election. Atiku said he was seeking the cancellation of Saturday’s presidential election because Tinubu’s campaign team admitted the poll was rigged. He noted that Tinubu’s presidential campaign team’s admittance that there was rigging in the southeast was evidence that the election witnessed irregularities. The PDP flag bearer stated this in a statement by his spokesman, Phrank Shaibu. He lamented that Tinubu’s campaign team had continued to attack and mock Nigerians despite stealing their mandate. Atiku stressed that Tinubu’s loss in Lagos was an indication that Nigerians don’t want him. The statement reads: “Festus Keyamo’s claim that there was massive rigging in the southeast and that the APC will be challenging the votes in that region validates our position that this election was fraught with irregularities. “Is it not funny that Tinubu claimed he wanted to replicate the developments of Lagos across Nigeria, and yet the same people of Lagos rejected him at the poll? “He and his minions unleashed thugs on the people of the state and yet still lost.”
