Legal luminary Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa on Friday hailed the Supreme Court for overruling the federal government‘s cash policy and naira redesign. The apex court ruled that all old N200, N500 and N1000 be allowed to circulate along with the Naira new notes until the end of December. Adegboruwa, in a statement, described the judgment as courageous and a confirmation of the sanctity of the rule of law and due process. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria said it was “a soothing relief” from the hardship that citizens have been subjected to over the past few weeks. “I salute the courage of the justices of the Supreme Court for rising up to rescue Nigerians from the pangs of death, frustration and looming economic recession.” He advised President Muhammadu Buhari to direct the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, to comply fully with the judgment of the Supreme Court. The SAN observed the people are happy because businesses will bounce back while they “celebrate their freedom from dictatorship and arbitrariness”. Adegboruwa added that the court should always be the platform for the resolution of all disputes by all aggrieved persons.
