A businesswoman, Mrs Joy Abu on Thursday, dragged her husband, Daniel before a Customary Court in Nyanya, Abuja, for allegedly denying her conjugal rights. Joy, who resides in the Jikwoyi area of Abuja, also accused her husband of being irresponsible. The woman, who is seeking a divorce, told the court that her husband does not care about her and their children. “My husband has practically denied me of my conjugal rights; he doesn’t care to know how I feel, he doesn’t know that marriage is not only about food. “A responsible man will cater also for the emotional needs of his wife,”she said. The petitioner stated that her husband doesn’t provide for the family and also abandoned them for one year. She prayed the court to grant her divorce; the custody of the children and compel her husband to pay N100,000 for the upkeep of their children every month. Daniel, who was present in court, denied all the allegations. The Presiding Judge, Labaran Gusau, however, adjourned the matter until March 30, for hearing. (NAN).
