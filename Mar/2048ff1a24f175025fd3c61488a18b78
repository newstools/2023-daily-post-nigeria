Famous Nollywood Actor Kenneth Okonkwo has alleged that the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu who is seeking re-election on March 18 took the people of the state for granted by ignoring gubernatorial debate. Okonkwo who was a spokesperson for the Obi/Datti Campaign Council in the just concluded presidential election stated this in tweets on Monday. According to him, prior to the presidential election, Sanwo-Olu had believed power comes “from Bourdilion.” The actor who called on Lagos residents to vote for the Labour Party candidate, Gbadebo Chinedu Rhodes-Vivour for better governance, said it’s time to liberate the state from “bullion van instigated democracy.” He wrote: “Sanwo-Olu was too big to join other contestants in Lagos State gubernatorial debate. He took Lagosians for granted because he thought that power comes from Bourdilion. “He will learn on March 18 that power comes from the people. His recent voluntary humility of visiting every nook and cranny of Lagos to solicit for support must be disregarded as an exercise in hypocrisy. “Lagosians must liberate Lagos from bullion van instigated democracy. Vote Gbadebo Chinedu Rhodes-Vivour of Labour Party for a new and free Lagos State. We moovee!”
