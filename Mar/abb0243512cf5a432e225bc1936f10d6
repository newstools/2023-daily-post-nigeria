Paris Saint-Germain defender, Sergio Ramos, has admitted they don’t have the quality required to compete in the Champions League. Ramos was reacting to their 2-0 defeat at Bayern Munich, which saw their exit from the competition in the last-16 stage. PSG had lost 1-0 at Parc des Princes three weeks ago. “Deeply disappointed in you and in us. We were not at the level required by #UCL. “We didn’t know how to handle the key details and we miss the main objective. “It’s painful, but champions are reborn from defeat and forged in adversity. We’ll be back!” Ramos said on Twitter.
