Members of Isuofia community in Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State, have commended the Anambra State Governor, Chukwuma Soludo, for numerous road construction in all parts of the state. The community, which is also the home community of the governor, also commended him for good governance. The President General of Isuofia Peoples Assembly, Chief Jude Chikadibia-Okeke, who spoke to journalists in Awka said the massive road construction and re-construction going on in different parts of Anambra State is a clear indication that Governor Soludo is determined to transform the state. “The governor is a man who knows where he is taking Anambra, and he has so far done very well, even within the short period of being in office. “The people need to support the governor by voting for APGA (All Progressives Grand Alliance) candidates in Saturday’s election, so that he will have a formidable House of Assembly members to work with. “The recent recruitment of 5,000 teachers shows that Governor Soludo has achieved a feat that has never been achieved before. The newly employed teachers need to reciprocate the gesture by being alive to their responsibilities. “There is no community you will go to today, and not find road construction going on. These are the things we need from government,” Okeke said. Chikadibia-Okeke called on voters in Anambra State to vote for APGA legislators that will work with the governor to achieve greater development for Anambra people.
