Manchester United manager, Erik ten Hag has warned his players about Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse. Ward-Prowse is widely regarded as one of the best free-kick takers in the history of the Premier League. The 28-year-old is only behind United legend David Beckham in the all-time list. Ahead of Southampton’s trip to Old Trafford on Sunday, Ten Hag has said his players must not give away silly fouls. “It’s always a problem when you play against Ward-Prowse. You shouldn’t give him easy free-kicks because he has the ability to score. “We have a good goalkeeper, but you shouldn’t take that risk,” Ten Hag said.
