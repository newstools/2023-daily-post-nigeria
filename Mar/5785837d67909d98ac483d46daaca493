The politician said their decision on election day “can be a miscarriage or safe delivery point”., depending on how they handle it. On possible collaboration by parties in the race, the gubernatorial hopeful said anything can happen within one day. “The unity of opposition parties is possible within 24 hours in order to chase out APC government from Kaduna State Government House,” he said.
