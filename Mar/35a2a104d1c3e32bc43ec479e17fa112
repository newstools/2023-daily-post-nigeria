Ene Obi, Convener Situation Room, has claimed that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has taken Nigeria more than 50 years backwards following the conclusion of the Feb. 25 Presidential election. Obi also claimed that INEC did not even get to some of their polling units during the last general election, adding that it was very shocking. She stated this during an interview with Arise TV on Monday. Obi said, “Because we are not bothered about who [APC’s Bola Tinubu, PDP’s Atiku Abubakar or LP’s Peter Obi] wins. All of them are Nigerians that are contesting. But the process is as good as the result that you get. So the process is very disappointing. “INEC, that is, the umpire that has the authority to conduct this election, is not talking to Nigerians about what they do. I think they should come out. “We are appealing for Nigerians not to give up. This is an experience of a lifetime, and we are going to experience it together. Many of us are here. We are not leaving this country for anybody. “So, whoever is trying to twist us will have to be responsible to answer for it. But we are appealing for calm. We are appealing for calm and for people not to give up, to go and cast their votes. “But we from the Civil Society are holding INEC for what they have done. We are holding the security sector also accountable for where we saw that they are guiding politicians to go and vote. This is the first election that we are hearing that INEC did not even get to polling units, which is very shocking. They have taken us more than 50 years back.”
