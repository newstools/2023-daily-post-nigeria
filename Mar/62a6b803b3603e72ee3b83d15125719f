Former Paris Saint-Germain forward, Pauleta, has tipped forward Kylian Mbappe to take over from Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in the near future. Messi and Ronaldo, two of the greatest players of the 21st century, are well into their 30s and are in the twilight of their football careers. The duo have won 12 Ballon d’Or awards between themselves. Speaking to L’Equipe, Pauleta said Mbappe can break all records in football, adding that the France international is the best player in the world at the moment. Pauleta said: “We are faced with a phenomenon that will mark history. He is the best player in the world today. He deserves this record, and I hope he’ll continue to score goals for PSG for a very long time. “He’s a goalscorer but above all, his mental and physical strength and his speed. He has everything to succeed like Zinédine Zidane, Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.” “Kylian can break all records and follow the same path as Messi or Ronaldo, that is for sure. It’s a phenomenon that can break all records.”
