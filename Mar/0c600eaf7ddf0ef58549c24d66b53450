The Accord Party’s House of Assembly candidate for Ogba-Egbema-Ndoni Constituency II, Rivers State, Chukwudi Ogbonna, has been reportedly kidnapped. Ogbonna was said to have been taken at gunpoint to an unknown destination by unidentified criminals around Rumuigbo community in Obio-Akpor Local Government Area of the state. The victim, who is said to be a popular candidate for Saturday’s election, was kidnapped at about 8:30 pm. Ogbonna was in a vehicle with a friend on his way back home when the incident occurred. The incident was confirmed by one Ifeakachukwu Nwakiri, who identified himself as the brother of the victim. Nwakiri claimed the kidnap was politically motivated, but noted that the police have been alerted. He also called on the Independent National Electoral Commission to consider suspending the State House of Assembly election for Onelga Constituency II slated for Saturday, pending the release of his brother. “He was double crossed and taken to an unknown destination. Up until now we have not heard from him. So we don’t know where he has been taken to. “Our plea and our call is to the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, the Commissioner of Police Director of DSS, NSCDC for all of them to swing into action to make sure they rescue Engineer Chukwudi Ogbonna.” He added.
