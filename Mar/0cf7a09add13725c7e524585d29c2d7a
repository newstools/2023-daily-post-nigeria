A group of legal practitioners, the Body of Bauchi Lawyers of Conscience (BOBALAC), on Tuesday, condemned the violence recorded at the campaigns of the gubernatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Air Marshal Saddique Abubakar (retd), saying that the life of every innocent citizen is priceless. A statement jointly signed by BOBALAC’s chief convener, Barrister Abdullatif Isa and secretary, Barrister Abubakar Idris was made available to journalists in Bauchi, the state capital. The group noted that since the electioneering processes commenced in the state, virtually all the major governorship candidates have been conducting their campaigns peacefully, devoid of violence or any security breach. “Unfortunately and from the news and information out there, it is only the APC and its governorship candidate that have been holding themselves out as an exception in this regard. “This is because so far, they are the only people whose campaign activities have been marred by one form of violent conduct with attendant negative consequences or the other. “Now as the issue has been dominating the public space across the state, it has become absolutely necessary for us as an assemblage of learned minds who have been in the vanguards of the advocacy for a responsible, orderly, civilized and lawful conduct in the state to call on the security agencies to rise to the occasion,” the group stated.
