Former Manchester Defender, Paul Parker, has urged his former club to sign Barcelona’s Frenkie de Jong at the end of the season. Parker said De Jong is a different type of player than midfielder Casemiro, adding that the Netherlands international is agile. De Jong was linked with a move to Man United in the last two transfer windows but ended up remaining at Barcelona. Speaking to SoccerNews.nl, Parker said, “I would love it if Manchester United signed De Jong. “He is a different type of player than Casemiro and he is quite agile on the ball. “He would fit perfectly in Ten Hag’s midfield.”
