Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni has described the emergence of Bola Ahmed Tinubu as president-elect and Kashim Shettima as vice president-elect as the best team for Nigeria at this time. Buni, who stated this in a congratulatory message on Tinubu/Shettima victory at the recent poll issued through his Media Aide, Mamman Mohammed, also noted that the people of Nigeria have spoken with great hope for a better Nigeria through the Tinubu/Shettima Presidency. He argued that Tinubu is a true Nigerian who accommodates Nigerians from various ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds. “His experience in transforming Lagos State would no doubt be used for the transformation of a larger Nigeria,” Buni said. He, therefore, called on Nigerians, including other candidates who contested along with him to support the President-elect to build a more united and prosperous Nigeria. He prayed God to guide the incoming Asiwaju/Kashim administration for a more united, prosperous and a better Nigeria. The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, declared Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the APC as the president-elect after scoring the highest votes of 8,794,726 in the keenly contested February 25th, 2023 presidential election.
