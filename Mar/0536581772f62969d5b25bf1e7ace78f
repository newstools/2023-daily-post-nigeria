Muhammad Shehu Molash, the Spokesman, North West All Progressives Congress, APC, Presidential Campaign Council, said that the zone gave the highest votes to its presidential candidate in the last Saturday’s election. This is following the declaration of the presidential candidate of the party, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the winner of the February 25th election. Briefing newsmen in Kaduna on Saturday, Molash disclosed that North West gave Tinubu the cumulative votes of 2,950,393 out of the 8,794,726 total votes he polled. According to him, the votes represented about 33.55 percent of the votes cast for the President-elect, calling voters to give governorship candidates massive votes to ensure success in the 11th March election. He explained, “The North West APC Presidential campaign council under the able leadership of the zonal Coordinator, Governor Bello Matawalle and his deputy, Salihu Lukman wishes to express their most profound gratitude to all those who contributed immensely towards the success of the APC in the just concluded 2023 Presidential elections.” The spokesman stated that the votes given to the presidential candidate of the party are a vindication of their earlier convictions that the North West geo-political zone is the strongest stronghold of the APC compared to the votes other zones gave the party in Nigeria. “The massive votes recorded, Despite the hurdles and conspiracies within and outside the zone, he said that the massive votes recorded are a clear manifestation of the mass appeal that the greatest politician of the time enjoys in the zone, pointing out that the tenacity and doggedness of the 6 APC governors, despite the stiff attempt to whip up ethnic sentiments by some supposed elders from the zone rejected the antics of these “Atiku’s elders” masquerading as Northern elders,” he said. In light of the foregoing, he added that the North West APC presidential campaign office appealed to all the people of the zone to come out en masse and vote for all APC gubernatorial candidates in the zone on the 11th of March 2023.
