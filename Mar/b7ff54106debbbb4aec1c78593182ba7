Real Madrid ace, Eden Hazard has revealed the extent of his damaged relationship with manager, Carlo Ancelotti. Hazard said that he and Ancelotti don’t talk with each other as the Italian gaffer has frozen him out of the first team. The 32-year-old has endured a miserable time at Real Madrid because of injuries and inconsistency. The Belgian joined Real Madrid from Chelsea in a €100million deal back in 2019. Hazard has not played a single minute of La Liga or Champions League action since his return from the World Cup, despite being fit to play. He has now opened up on the situation, admitting he would like to stay at Real Madrid beyond this summer. “I would like to stay. I have always said that. I hope to play and to show that I can still do it,” Hazard said, as per reports from Diario AS. “People have doubts, that is normal, I understand. But for me, I am still here next year. You never know, but a transfer is not in my plan. “There is respect between Ancelotti and I. But I am not going to say we talk to each other, because we don’t. But there will always be respect. “I have to have respect for a guy like Ancelotti. For what he represents in football and for what he’s done in his career.”
