A former presidential aide, Reno Omokri has said that Christians must discard the approach they deployed in the just concluded Presidential and National Assembly elections. According to him, Christians must avoid the temptation of approaching elections the way and manner they went about this one. Many electorates in the country believe that their votes did not count. There are allegations of massive rigging of the Saturday’s polls by some state governors. But Omokri believes that approaching the election through religious lines did not help Christians, who according to him, turned out for the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi. According to the results read out by the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Mahmood Yakubu, Tinubu polled a total of 8,794,726 to defeat his closest rivals and candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi of the Labour Party, LP who scored 6,984, 520 and 6,101,533 respectively. The former Lagos State helmsman also fulfilled the 25 percent votes from 24 States as stipulated in the Electoral Act 2022 as amended. “The Islamic vote was divided 3 ways amongst Atiku, Tinubu and Kwankwaso. The Christian vote was united behind Obi. “Yet, look at the result! No matter the provocation, Christians must NEVER allow future elections to be about religion. It won’t serve us well!”
