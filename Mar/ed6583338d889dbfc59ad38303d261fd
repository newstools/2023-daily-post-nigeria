The Chief Imam of Nurul Yaqeen Jumma’at Mosque Life Camp, Abuja, Sheikh Yahya Al-Yolawi, on Friday called on the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to release more redesigned naira notes as the months of Ramadan is fast approaching. Al-Yolawi made the plea while delivering his Jumma’at sermon, titled, “The Significance of Ramadan Fast: Health, Spiritual, Social and Psychological Benefits of Ramadan Fast,” in Abuja. He noted that Muslims spend more money during Ramadan on charitable activities and food items. The cleric said: “And that largely depends on the accessibility of cash in and out flow of individuals and organisations and that is essential in the world of business. Keeping that spirit even after Ramadan is very crucial to the growth and development of your business. “I would like to use this medium to call on the Federal Government and the Central Bank of Nigeria to release more cash to the country as Ramadan is fast approaching. “People are in utmost need of money for Ramadan expenses and other activities. May Allah make it easier for all of us, Ameen.” This year’s Ramadan is expected to commence on Wednesday, March 22 and end in the evening of Friday, April 21. DAILY POST reports that the cash crunch has been biting hard across the federation, including the Federal Capital Territory, FCT.
