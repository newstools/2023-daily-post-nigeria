President-elect Bola Tinubu has sent a special birthday goodwill message to Pastor Enoch Adeboye. The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, regarded as the largest pentecostal church worldwide, clocked 82 today. The former Lagos State governor’s media adviser, Tunde Rahman issued a statement, praising the influential cleric. Tinubu noted that Adeboye has been a tremendous blessing to Nigeria, Africa and the world with his ministerial work as a preacher and leader. He recalled their relationship since his time as governor and how the annual Lagos State Thanksgiving Service started then. Tinubu said Adeboye has been “an exemplary model” whose teachings and counsel have continued to moderate and stabilise the country. The President-elect wished the clergyman many glorious years in the service of God and the unfailing service to humanity.
