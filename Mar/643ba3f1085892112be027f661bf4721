Former lawmaker and social critic, Shehu Sani, has likened the relationship between Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and the Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate in the February 25 election to that of a man who jilted his lady and married another woman. Senator Sani said one could not be trying to be nice to continue a relationship with a lady he jilted. His statement is contained in a post via his verified Twitter handle on Saturday. Sani was referring to how Wike supported Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress, APC, during the presidential election and is now making nice remarks about Obi ahead of the gubernatorial and State House of Assembly elections. Recall that some Nigerians and supporters of the Labour Party, LP, felt governor Wike worked against the interest of Obi in favour of Tinubu during the presidential election, an action Wike has denied. However, the Rivers Governor on Saturday said Obi was his hero of the presidential election, claiming Obi ensured a president-elect of the Southern extraction emerged. He made the statement while addressing Igbo traders at a town hall seeking their support for the March 18 gubernatorial election in the State. Meanwhile, Sani believed Wike was trying to be nice in recent times to Obi and his supporters when he had supported and shifted camp to Tinubu during the presidential election. He wrote, “Wike and Peter; it’s like trying to be nice in order to continue a relationship with a lady you jilted, after marrying another.”
