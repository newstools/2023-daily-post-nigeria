Cremonese manager, Davide Ballardini has showered encomium on Cyriel Dessers after the Nigerian impressive display in the defeat to Sassuolo. Dessers, who came in as a substitute for Ghana forward, Afena Gyan scored a brace in the 3-2 defeat at the MAPEI Stadium. The 28-year-old was injured for several weeks and was an unused substitute in the club’s previous two games. The former Feyenoord star, however, showed his class with a superb showing against Sassuolo. “He was very good, he did well. His assignment is to always play this way: bold, determined and then decisive,” Ballardini told reporters. Dessers has scored five goals in 19 league appearances for Cremonese this season.
