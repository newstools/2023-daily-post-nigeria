Flutterwave’s Founder and CEO Olugbenga ‘GB’ Agboola said the leading tech company is happy to be a lead sponsor at this year’s AFTS event. “We believe that the AFTS network has been instrumental in developing and shaping the fintech industry in Africa and Flutterwave has been an active enabler of the ecosystem growth. “We’re always enthusiastic to work with the Africa Fintech Summit team in engaging stakeholders and partners who help us create endless possibilities. We’re excited for all this opportunity provides as we continue on our vision to connect African countries through payments,” GB added. “It is with immense gratitude and great pleasure that we are welcoming back Flutterwave as our Lead Fintech Sponsor for both our April & November summits this year,” said Zekarias Amsalu, Co-Founder of AFTS and MD of Ibex Frontier. “Flutterwave has been and continues to be an impactful, progressive, and innovative Fintech that enables the wide Fintech ecosystem in Africa and beyond and demonstrates the Africanization of Tech in its global growth trajectory.”
