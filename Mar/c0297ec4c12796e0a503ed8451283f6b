The spokesman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Presidential Campaign Council, APC, Festus Keyamo, has disclosed why the Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate, Peter Obi can’t come to court to demand that he should be declared winner of the presidential election. Keyamo said Obi must fight the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to prove he came second. He said after proving they came second, then they can wrest the position of the presidency with the President-Elect, Bola Tinubu. In a tweet, Keyamo wrote: “Peter Obi & Labour Party cannot even come to court & ask to be declared winner straightaway. “They have to first fight PDP in order to prove they came second, before they can have the temerity to face @officialABAT. So, there is no room for cooperation b/w Labour & PDP in court.” Obi came third in last Saturday’s presidential election after PDP’s Atiku Abubakar and Tinubu, who was declared winner of the poll.
