The Court of Appeal in Abuja on Wednesday evening granted permission to the President-elect, Bola Tinubu to have direct access to the server of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to inspect all materials used for the February 25 presidential election. The court in a ruling on ex-parte application by Tinubu ordered the electoral body to permit the President- elect to make photocopies of documents during the inspection. Justice Joseph Ikwegh who delivered the ruling said that he was satisfied that there is merit in the request of Tinubu to access, inspect and make photocopy of documents required for his whatever purpose. Justice Ikwegh held that the President-elect is entitled to have access to the INEC server in addition to making photocopies for his use to defend his election from any petition.
