Chelsea boss, Graham Potter, has singled out three of his players for special praise following his side’s Premier League 3-1 win over Leicester City on Saturday. The three players are Marc Cucurella, Mykhailo Mudryk and Enzo Fernandez. Potter said Mudryk’s attitude is fantastic, while Cucurella has put in two great performances for Chelsea and Fernandez is a fantastic player that sees everything on the pitch. The Englishman watched as goals from Ben Chilwell, Kai Havertz and Mateo Kovacic gave Chelsea all three points against Leicester City at the King Power Stadium. Speaking at his post-match press conference after the game, Potter said, “It’s been a team performance over the week. It takes time to develop that, but the spirit is growing. The togetherness I really like, fighting to play, ready to play. Marc Cucurella has been out of the squad for a while but has now put in two great performances. “[Mudryk] He will get better and better. He is a young player that hasn’t that much experience, so with each game he will get better and better. His attitude is fantastic. “He [Enzo] is a fantastic player, a young player. I think he’s going to get better and better when he’s with us more. You can see his quality, when he gets the ball, he passes forward. He sees everything.”
