A single mother, Ifeoma Ossai, is currently in police net for allegedly killing her landlord, Surulere Oladele, in Ogun State. Ossai was arrested by the police on Saturday following a report lodged at the Sango Ota divisional headquarters by one Olaleye Taiwo. The complainant had reported to the police that his brother, Oladele had a disagreement with his tenant over the payment of electricity bill, and in the process, she “grabbed the manhood of the deceased and dragged him with it.” In a statement by the Ogun State police spokesman, the landlord was said to have gone unconscious on the ground and was rushed to the General Hospital, Ota, where he was pronounced dead by the doctor on duty. Upon the report, Oyeyemi said the DPO of Sango Ota Division, CSP Saleh Dahiru, had immediately led his men to the scene where the suspect was arrested. During interrogation, the suspect had claimed that “the deceased asked her to pay for electricity bill, but she insisted that until water is directly connected to her apartment as promised by the landlord before she packed in, she will not pay the electricity or any other utility bill.” This, it was learnt, led to a scuffle between them and she grabbed the deceased’s manhood and dragged him with it. Oyeyemi said the corpse had been deposited at the mortuary for post-mortem. Meanwhile, Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Frank Mba, has ordered that the suspect be transferred to the homicide section of the State CIID for further investigation and diligent prosecution.
