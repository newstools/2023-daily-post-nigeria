Manchester United legend, Paul McGrath, has explained that getting rid of Cristiano Ronaldo and buying Casemiro from Real Madrid has been key to the Red Devils’ revival this season. Recall that Ronaldo left Man United after his contract was terminated last year, while Erik ten Hag’s side also signed Casemiro last summer. “The two key pieces in the United jigsaw for 2022/23 have been selling Cristiano Ronaldo and buying Casemiro,” McGrath wrote in his Sunday World column. “It’s strange to write that getting rid of one of the greatest players there has ever been was a good thing for United. “But all the evidence is that it was just that. Within weeks of Ronaldo departing, his Portuguese team-mate Bruno Fernandes said ‘we are playing like a team now’.” Man United are currently in the third position in the Premier League table behind leaders Arsenal and Manchester City. The Red Devils recently won the Carabao Cup trophy after beating Newcastle United in the final at Wembley Stadium.
