Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes, has admitted that he was wrong about the credentials of Liverpool and the Red Devils earlier this season. Liverpool and Man Utd will lock horns against each other in a Premier League tie on Sunday evening at Anfield. But Scholes has now revealed that he was wrong to consider Jurgen Klopp’s side as title challengers this season, adding that Man United were miles apart from their Premier League arch-rivals last season. The former England midfielder told Premier League Productions, “Not a chance (of him expecting Manchester United to be ten points clear of Liverpool compared to their defeat at Anfield twelve months ago). “Working at the game on the night. The teams were miles apart.” He continued, “I’ve been a little surprised by Liverpool’s season. I was actually on here thinking Liverpool have a great chance of winning the league this year. I was so wrong.”
