The Postmaster General of the federation and CEO of the Nigerian Postal Service, NIPOST, Rt. Hon Adeyemi Sunday Adepoju, has said the emergence of president-elect Bola Ahmed Tinubu would triple the growth of Nigeria’s digital economy and all aspects of the Nation’s economy. The PMG disclosed this to DAILY POST in an interview on Wednesday while reacting to Tinubu’s victory at the general election. He stated that hope is back in the nation with the emergence of Tinubu. Adepoju said Tinubu would not renege on his promise to rebuild Nigeria. He added that the President-elect would restore security and investors’ confidence in Nigeria. “The message is clear, renewed hope. Hope in every aspect of human endeavour is back. Hope in security because it is the number one thing to tackle to attract investors. For an improved economy, you need a secure environment; Asiwaju is capable. He did it in Lagos. “He is on familiar terrain; he will better the Nation. Expect the best from nobody else than the president-elect. “You should expect that the digital economy will grow triple because he is a leader that is well exposed. For instance, when he became the governor of Lagos in 1999, the state’s revenue generation was N600 million. Before he left, it was around N8 billion; now Lagos is coasting home with over N50 billion. “Nigerians should be happy, the hope is back, and within a short period, you will see changes. You will have foreign investors because Tinubu is capable. He will build on the good side of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration”, he said. Tinubu emerged winner of the keenly contested presidential election with 8,794,726 votes.
