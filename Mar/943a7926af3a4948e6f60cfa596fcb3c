Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar, has been ruled out for the rest of this season. The Brazilian will need surgery on an ankle injury he suffered last month. Neymar was forced off during PSG’s win over Lille on February 19. The club has now said Neymar will miss between three and four months. “Following his last sprain contracted on February 20, the medical staff of Paris Saint-Germain recommended a ligament repair operation, in order to avoid a major risk of recurrence. “All of the experts consulted confirmed this need. A delay of three to four months is expected before his return to collective training,” an official club statement reads.
