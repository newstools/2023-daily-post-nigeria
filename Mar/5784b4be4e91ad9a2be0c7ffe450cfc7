As lobbying for the 10th National Assembly principal officers begins behind the scene, the Campaign for Democracy, CD, has advocated that the slot for Senate President be zoned to the North Central. The foremost Civil Society Organisation and pro-democracy group stated it would promote unity, fairness and justice if the number three position is cited in the North Central by the ruling party. In a statement which was issued by the Secretary General, Ifeanyi Odili, and sent to DAILY POST on Thursday in Abuja, he maintained that citing the position to the North Central would take care of the perceived marginalisation of the geopolitical zone. The zone has not produced the President or Vice through any political platform since 1999 despite being consistently supporting the two known dominant parties. Odili said: “The Zone has not produced the president nor vice president of the country, and it was only proper that the zone should be allowed to produce the next Senate President in the 10th National Assembly. “Some people are arguing that the South-East should be favoured in the interest of fairness, equity and justice, forgetting that the North Central has suffered the worst fate since Nigeria’s independence in 1960.” The statement argued that the zone experienced the worst form of insecurity because of the lack of representation in the nation’s highest political hierarchy, noting that it would serve the nation’s interest to allow North Central get to the third seat in the nation. Citing the case of Niger State, the group maintained that the State produced the single largest votes for the ruling party which has been consistent since 1999 till February 25, 2023, presidential and parliamentary elections. This feat, the group said, was despite the lack of commensurate compensation and attention which they have demonstrated much more in voting for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu yet again.
