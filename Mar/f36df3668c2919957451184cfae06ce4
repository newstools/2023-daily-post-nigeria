The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has commenced the rehabilitation of flood victims in Anambra State. The organization yesterday flagged off a three-month medical outreach in 10 local government areas of the state that were submerged by the 2022 flood. The Reproductive Health Coordinator, in the Anambra State Ministry of Health, Dr Obianuju Okoye who spoke with journalists during the launch of the programme in Onitsha North Local Government Area said the programme was a partnership between the Anambra State Government and UNICEF. “We’re carrying out a three-month medical outreach of flood-affected areas. There are 10 local government areas in all. We have 21 health facilities we are using as a hub from where we distribute medicals to various wards. “This is fully sponsored by UNICEF, and Anambra State is providing the manpower for the programme. It’s an integrated approach, and we are checking and giving care to HIV, and cervical cancer patients. We are also diagnosing and treating victims for various other ailments, “she said. Okoye said among the rural people that have been attended to, many were found to have peptic ulcer, malaria parasites, pains, hypertension and diabetes. UNICEF had late last year paid an assessment visit to the flood-ravaged parts of the state and mapped out ways of assisting flood victims with medication, water projects and toilet facilities.
