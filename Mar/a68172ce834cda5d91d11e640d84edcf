Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State has expressed optimism that the electoral victory of APC presidential candidate Bola Ahmed Tinubu will reinvent Nigeria. This was contained in his congratulatory message to the President-elect today as signed by his chief press secretary, Barrister Christian Ita. In the message, the governor described Tinubu as a pathfinder whose presidency will reinvent Nigeria. “Our incoming President is a rare gift to Nigeria, he is a pathfinder, a talent hunter and an achiever whose reign will usher in a new vista of hope and reinvent Nigeria for better,” Ayade said in the statement. The governor noted that the election of Tinubu as president was “Cross River’s prayer answered because he already has a blueprint for the economic development of our dear state.” “On behalf of the Government of Cross River State, I extend my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to you, Your Excellency, on your well-deserved victory.

Wishing the President-elect a successful tenure, Ayade said: “As you prepare to take up the responsibilities and challenges of your high office, I wish you a successful tenure. “My mantra, Mr President-Elect, during the campaigns was loud and clear. And it was that just as you laboured hard to fix Lagos during your time as governor, [the] same trajectory of performance will once again restore Nigeria to its greatness, given your dedication, boundless energy and a clear vision. “I am of the strong conviction that your long-term political engagement and vast experience are the very foundation on which you will carry out your responsible mandate and mission as President. Congratulations once again, Mr President.”
