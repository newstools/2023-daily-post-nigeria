Chelsea are reportedly interested in replacing under-fire manager Graham Potter with Brighton boss Roberto de Zerbi, according to Football Insider. Recall that De Zerbi is the man who took over from Potter at Brighton. De Zerbi is regarded as a top coach and Chelsea bosses reportedly rank him very highly. Potter is enduring a torrid spell at Stamford Bridge, having lost three games in a row in all competitions. The Englishman is believed to be living on borrowed time at the west London club, despite the fact that Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly had initially chosen to stick by him to turn the clubâ€™s fortunes around. The report added that although Chelsea are still sticking by Potter for now, there have been quiet talks behind the scenes on potential replacements, with De Zerbi on top of the shortlist. The 43-year-old Italian is viewed as an exciting young manager who could take Chelsea to the next level with his modern and radical way of management.
