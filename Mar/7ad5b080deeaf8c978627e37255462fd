A former chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Arewa Solidarity Forum, Shuaib Ganga and scores of supporters from Sagamu Local Government Area of Ogun State have defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Ganga, while leading 15 chairmen and other members of the executives of the forum to the country home of the governor, disclosed that they were tired of the PDP in the state and opted to join the moving train of the governor. Ganga, who disclosed that members of the forum were ready to endorse the governor for a second term in office, added that they would mobilise their kinsmen in the local government to vote massively for him. “We are here to decamp from the PDP to the APC [and] at the same time to endorse Your Excellency for another term of four years,” he said. Members of the forum who all spoke in unison on their eagerness to don the yellow colour of the governor, displayed their loyalty by tearing the identity cards of their former political party. Also, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youths, Ogun State, led by Kingsley Chukwuleta and members of the Igbo community have also thrown their weight behind the second-term ambition of Dapo Abiodun. Speaking, Chukwuleta, who noted that Igbo youths are proud of the achievements of the governor in the last three and half years, added that they would give 100% support to the governor. In his response, Governor Abiodun commended the Arewa Solidarity Forum and the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youths of Ogun State, for coming forward to show their support for his second-term ambition, saying that he was humbled by their support and endorsement. Abiodun, while assuring them that they won’t regret their decision to join the ruling party in the state, urged them to go all out and canvas for votes for his re-election.
