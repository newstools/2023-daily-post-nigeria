The Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, on Saturday revealed why God raised Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of Labour Party, LP. Keyamo said God raised Obi to make the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu a president. He noted that Obi was a means to an end for Tinubu’s emergence. In a tweet, Keyamo wrote: “Indeed, God Almighty raised Peter Obi for a purpose: that purpose was to make @officialABAT President. “Peter Obi was the means to an end, but not the end itself. Many Men of God, with the greatest respect to them, obviously missed this part of the visions that they saw about 2023.” Obi came third behind Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party, and the eventual winner of the 2023 presidential election, Tinubu.
