Labour Party’s House of Representatives candidate in Ogun, Tolulope Phillips, has denied defecting to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. The politician told reporters in his office at Olorunsogo in Abeokuta that he was still in the LP. Phillips said his parley with Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, governorship candidate, Oladipupo Adebutu should not be misconstrued as defection. He explained that the meeting with the frontrunner was after Adebutu requested “our support politically”. Phillips said democracy permits formation of alliance, collaboration or support for one party or the other. “Doing this for me doesn’t translate to defection to another party,” he noted. “Hon. Adebutu is one of the notable sons of Ogun and one of the governorship candidates soliciting our support”. Phillips reminded the public that the LP flagbearer had not been recognized by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC. He added that his camp was still consulting but would work with parties “ready to accommodate our plans for the people”.
