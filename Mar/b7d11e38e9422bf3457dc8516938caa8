Pa Reuben Fasoranti, the National Leader of the Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, at the weekend, appealed to other presidential candidates, Peoples Democratic Party’s Atiku Abubakar, Labour Party’s Peter Obi, among others, in last Saturday’s election, to allow the president-elect, Bola Tinubu, to settle down to tackle Nigeria’s myriads of problems. Fasoranti urged them not to do anything that would set Nigeria on fire. He stated this in a congratulatory message, which he signed to Tinubu and made available to newsmen in Akure, the Ondo State capital. Fasoranti said, ”l now appeal to all concerned Nigerians and the International Community, who might be aggrieved, one way or the other, not to do anything that will set Nigeria on fire. “We should all go peaceful, take lawful means, and thread legitimate and legal paths to rectify anything that might have, from their own point of view, gone wrong. ”Let Tinubu and all concerned settle down immediately to tackle the enormous Nigerian project of tackling insecurity, solving our economic downturn, restructuring the country, and rebuilding a nation never so badly divided into ethnic, religious and corrupt lines.” Atiku and Obi on Thursday declared their resolve to challenge the outcome of the presidential election. Obi, on Thursday, against the declaration of INEC, said he won the election and would explore all legal and peaceful means to prove that he won at the polls. Atiku of the PDP advanced to a similar position.
