Barcelona manager, Xavi Hernandez has criticized his team for not being able to keep the ball following their Copa del Rey semi-final first-leg 1-0 win against Real Madrid on Thursday. Xavi also said that Real Madrid are favourites to qualify for the Copa del Rey final despite losing the first leg against Barcelona. Eder Militao’s own goal at the Santiago Bernabeu gave Barcelona a slender first-leg advantage in the Copa del Rey semi-final tie against Real Madrid. Speaking at his post-match press conference, Xavi said, “We have not been able to keep the ball. It has been difficult for us to win duels to have possession, but we have defended very well. We have fought until the end and that is very positive. “The 0-1 gives us a certain advantage, but we are going to have to compete very well against a very strong Real Madrid side. I still see Madrid as a favourite.” The second leg of the semi-final will take place in the first week of April at Camp Nou.
