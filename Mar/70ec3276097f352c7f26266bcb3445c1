Vice-President-elect, Senator Kashim Shettima on Monday chaired a meeting attended by National Assembly members-elect of the All Progressives Congress, APC. House of Representatives Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila and Ali Ndume (APC Borno-South) briefed State House correspondents. The APC advised the incoming lawmakers to play down on issues of zoning and leadership of the 10th Assembly. Gbajabiamila disclosed they were urged to focus on the governorship election scheduled for March 18. He said the gathering was to celebrate the party’s victory at the February 25 presidential election. “On zoning, we did talk about it; it is neither here nor there yet,” said the Surulere federal constituency rep. “We have another election this weekend and we want to make sure that everybody goes back home, roll up their sleeves.”
