A former Commissioner for Justice and Attorney-General in Akwa Ibom State, Uwemedimo Nwoko SAN, said there is no dispute surrounding the status of Pastor Umo Eno as the authentic gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the state for the March 11, 2023 governorship election. He stressed that the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, acting on the orders of the appeal court, had restored Eno’s name of Pastor Eno on its platform as the eligible guber candidate of the party in the State. Speaking in a press conference in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State capital, Nwoko noted that currently, there is no court process filed against Pastor Eno that is before them, disclosing that the Court of Appeal had made a final pronouncement on the matter in respect of the Michael Enyong case while the Supreme Court rested the matter in respect of Akan Okon’s case. According to him, “All the court cases concerning Umo Eno’s candidature, the final decisions have been made, and there is no dispute as to that again.” Nwoke also maintained his earlier stance that Mike Enyong should present himself to the police for investigation, saying that the restraining order of arrest obtained from the court has already expired, having stayed for seven days.
