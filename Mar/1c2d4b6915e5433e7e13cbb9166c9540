Islamic group, the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), has said that Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has no right to rename the rebuilt Adogba Central Mosque in Iwo Road Ibadan, which his administration demolished in 2020 after himself. MURIC warned Makinde to remove his name from the mosque before next Saturday’s Governorship election. Prof. Ishaq Akintola, the MURIC Executive Director, stated this in a statement on Saturday. Akintola said, “Our attention has been drawn to the name of Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, which has been conspicuously printed on the newly rebuilt Adogba Central Mosque, Iwo Road, Ibadan. It’s an insult to the corporate dignity of the Muslim community of Oyo State, in particular, and the entire Muslim Ummah in Nigeria. “Makinde has no moral right to name the mosque after himself because it was a replacement of the original mosque, which was demolished by him. “MURIC advised the governor to effect the change before the gubernatorial election on Saturday to avoid a protest vote. “It doesn’t belong to him. It’s an attempt to rewrite history.” Meanwhile, the Governorship election will take place on Saturday, March 18 2023, across some states in Nigeria.
