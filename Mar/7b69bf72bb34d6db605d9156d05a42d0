The leadership of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, in Ebonyi State at the weekend condemned the gruesome murder of Mr Ogbonnaya Ugwu, the councillor representing Echara Ward 2 in Okposi community, Ohaozara Local Government Area. Ugwu, popularly known as SPACO, was killed by unknown gunmen around 10 pm on Saturday night as he was returning from his shop, a drinking joint known as Angle 90 in Okposi. DAILY POST reports that Ugwu was accosted and shot by gunmen at the Okposi Court Area junction. His murder, the second killing around the court area within a month, triggered protests in the community. The leadership of APGA in Ebonyi State expressed shock over the incident in a statement signed by Charles Otu, Director, Media and Publicity of the campaign council of the party’s gubernatorial candidate, Prof. Benard Odoh. “Just a few weeks to the last election, another youth, Mr Ogbonnaya Agwu was gunned down by yet-to-be-identified gunmen in the same Court Area [of] Okposi Okwu in Ohaozara Local Government Area,” the statement affirmed. The party tasked Governor David Umahi not to leave any stone unturned to apprehend and bring to book, the murderous gang that has been terrorizing Okposi community, Ohaozara LGA and the entire state. The party further urged the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba and other security agencies to mop up arms that are in the hands of unauthorised persons, especially thugs, before the forthcoming governorship and House of Assembly elections in the 13 LGAs of the state. APGA further tasked security agencies to retrieve all arms and ammunition given to the disbanded Ebubeagu security outfit, which according to them are stockpiled in the old Government House in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State.
