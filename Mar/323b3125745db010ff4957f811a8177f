Following the emergence of Bola Tinubu as Nigeria’s President-elect, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Bode George, has vowed to retire from partisan politics. George said he would retire from active politics after the governorship election on March 11. Featuring on Arise News on Thursday, George lamented over the presidential election that produced Tinubu. The elder statesman accused the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Prof Mahmood Yakubu of not living up to his promises of ensuring a free and fair election. He urged Yakubu to allow the will of the people to prevail during the governorship election. According to George: “I have decided to retire from partisan politics after the governorship election, and I can decide to go and live anywhere. I want a peaceful life for myself. “I know this fellow (Tinubu) and he’s not for them. If he had gone through the process, I would have congratulated him. You can’t go through darkness to get to light. I can go and live anywhere, it can be Ghana, Togo, or still remain in Nigeria.”
