The Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, CPPE, has commended the ruling of the Supreme Court on the use of the old currency naira notes validity. DAILY POST reports this in a statement by the CPPE’s Director, Dr Muda Yusuf on Friday. CPPE urged President Muhammadu Buhari, and the Central Bank of Nigeria to comply with the Supreme Court’s judgement for the good of the ordinary masses. According to CPPE, CBN has been defective in its Naira redesign policy implementation. Yusuf said the entire exercise is needless and insensitive. He stated that Nigerians deserve an apology from CBN and Buhari on the way and manner it went about the policy. “Hopefully, President Buhari, the Central Bank Governor and the Attorney General of the federation would comply with this court order in the interest of the rule of law, good order and public interest”.
