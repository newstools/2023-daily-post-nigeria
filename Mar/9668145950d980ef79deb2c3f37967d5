Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State has described the death of Coach Isma’ila Mabo as a great loss, not only to his immediate family but to the entire people of Plateau State and Nigeria at large, considering the impact he made in his sporting career and football in particular. He also said he received, with shock but with total submission to the will of God, the demise of the coach. DAILY POST recalls that Mabo’s death was announced in the early hours of Monday by family members. Lalong, through his Director of Press and Public Affairs, Dr Makut Macham, said the deceased, in his playing days, devoted his “strength, energy and talent” to playing for many great clubs, including the famous Mighty Jets Football Club of Jos and the national team, Green Eagles (Super Eagles). The Governor maintained that Mabo is credited with discovering and mentoring young talents, grooming them and exposing them to great clubs in the State, Nigeria and the world, thereby enhancing the sport. “We remember fondly his exploits as the Head Coach of the female national team, the Falcons, during the FIFA 1999 Women’s World Cup; 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics Games; as well as the Quarter Finals of the World Cup, among others. “During his lifetime on earth, Coach Mabo loved people and promoted peace, unity and oneness irrespective of ethnic, religious or political considerations”, he explained. Lalong said he had lost a personal friend and mentor who not only offered him support during his football days but also offered him advice on enhancing the game of football when he became Governor. The Governor, on behalf of his family, the people and the Government of the State, prayed to God to grant his soul eternal rest and comfort the family.
