Aare Onakakanfo of Yoruba land, Iba Gani Adams has urged the President-elect Bola Tinubu to restructure Nigeria to regionalism. The traditional leader made the appeal at the 2023 edition of the annual Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) Thanksgiving programme in Lagos. Adams said Nigeria has passed through difficult moments, insisting “restructuring into regionalism remains the best option for Nigeria”. Adams, the national coordinator of the OPC, said the socio-cultural Yoruba group scaled through “challenges either from within or outside the Southwest” in nearly three decades. “In the last 29 years, OPC has survived various challenges. We have been at the forefront of the war to reclaim the lost glory of our race. “We have remained the most formidable organization in Yoruba land. We have secured the Southwest region from internal and external aggressors.” The Aare added that “the current war is spiritual…that is where God has been the pillar of support for our organization”. In separate sermons, Sheikh Abdul Mumin Saliu and Pastor Ayobami Ojo of the Apostolic Garden Cherubim and Seraphim Church commended Adams for his activism and promotion of Yoruba culture and tradition.
