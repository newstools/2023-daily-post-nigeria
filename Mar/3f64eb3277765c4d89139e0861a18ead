Fulham head coach, Marco Silva has reportedly emerged as a leading contender to replace Antonio Conte at Tottenham Hotspur should the Italian leave Spurs. Conte’s future at Tottenham remains uncertain, with his contract set to expire at the end of this season. The former Chelsea manager has the option to extend his deal by 12 months, but it looks increasingly likely he will depart Tottenham in the summer. Tottenham are set to end another year without silverware, having been eliminated from both the FA Cup and Champions League in recent weeks. They also face a significant challenge from Newcastle, Liverpool and Brighton to finish in the Premier League top four. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy may be forced to part ways with Conte if their hopes of qualifying for the UEFA Champions League look in doubt. And, according to The Sun, Silva could be the club’s number one choice to replace the former Inter Milan manager if he departs as expected. Silva has overseen a remarkable rise with Fulham since returning to English football in the summer of 2021. His team currently sits in the eighth position on the Premier League table and also remains in contention for a European spot next season. The report added that Levy is likely to be impressed by Silva’s ability to transform Fulham without spending copious amounts of cash, although it remains to be seen if his appointment would be enough to convince Tottenham striker Harry Kane to remain at the club.
