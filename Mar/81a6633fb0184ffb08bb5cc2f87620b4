The Conference of Nigeria Political Parties, CNPP, has said that the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, not President Muhammadu Buhari, should be held responsible if the country burns following outcome of the presidential and national Assembly elections. The CNPP disclosed this on Thursday by its Secretary General, Willy Ezugwu, exonerate Buhari from all matters arising from the just general elections results. The group was reacting to Appeal Court judgment that granted INEC the permission to reconfigure its Bimodal Voter Accreditation System, BVAS for the governorship and state house of assembly elections. CNPP lamented that INEC would have foreseen the challenges of the BVAS before deployment. It called on International community to hold the Commission to account should crisis emanate from the forthcoming gubernatorial and House of Assembly Elections. “If INEC ends up tampering with the information in the BVAS machines or erases evidence of what actually transpired during the now contentious presidential election, it may lead to a disaster the country should not be allowed to happen to Nigeria and Nigerians”, the group said. The Appeal on Wednesday granted INEC permission to reconfigure the BVAS for use in the March 18 governorship and house of assembly elections.
