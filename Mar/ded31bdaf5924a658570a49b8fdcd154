Tottenham boss, Antonio Conte has branded his attacker, Richarlison ‘selfish’ after the player lambasted him after Wednesday’s Champions League defeat against AC Milan. Tottenham crashed out of the Champions League after playing out a goalless draw with AC Milan in the second leg of the encounter at the Tottenham Stadium during which Antonio Conte’s men mustered just two shots on target. Richarlison, who came on from the bench with just 20 minutes left, spoke to the press and slammed his manager’s tactics and described his side’s season as s***. Conte said: “First of all, I watched the interview of Richarlison. His season has not been good. “He’s scored no goals for us. I think he was really honest to say his season was not good. “I think he made a mistake. When you speak of ‘I’ and not ‘us’ you are being selfish. “He made a mistake and he apologised and it was good for me to clarify with the team again about this.”
