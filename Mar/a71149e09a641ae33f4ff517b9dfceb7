The feat that eluded Governor Darius Dickson Ishaku of Taraba State was achieved effortlessly by his deputy, Engineer Haruna Manu who on Wednesday emerged victorious as the senator-elect for Taraba Central senatorial district in the just concluded presidential and senatorial elections. Manu and his principal, Ishaku, had jostled for Senate positions in their respective senatorial districts in last Saturday’s election. While Manu triumphed in the exercise, the reverse was the case for Gov Ishaku, who could not even deliver his polling unit to the party’s presidential candidate. Announcing the results at Bali Local Government Council Secretariat, the venue of the collation centre, the returning officer, Prof Oladapo Olanrewaju Philips of the Federal University Wukari, declared Manu the winner, having satisfied the requirements of the law for the election. Manu, who contested the election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, scored 75,460 votes to win the election, defeating the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Bashir Marafa, who trailed behind him with 50,437 votes to emerge second in the election.
