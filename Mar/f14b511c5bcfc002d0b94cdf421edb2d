The South South National Vice Chairman of the Labour Party, Favour Reuben has alleged that members of the National Working Committee were not informed about the decision of the National Chairman, Julius Abure to dissolve the Rivers State executives. Reuben, who spoke during a media briefing in PortHarcourt, insisted that Dienye Pepple remains the chairman of LP in Rivers State because as a national leader of the party, he was not informed about the decision that was made in his region. He called on security agencies to arrest anyone who attempts to occupy the Labour Party office, in the name of Steering Committee. “I’m the National Vice Chairman in charge of South South. If there is any decision that is taken by the national committee, I should be in the know. None of the NWC members was in the know, which is an aberration. “It is against the law of Labour Party and our constitution, that a none member, Kenneth Okonkwo, who is not a card-carrying member, will announce the dissolution of Labour Party state exco. That is why the National Legal Adviser of the party came out to say that whatever was done by Kenneth Okonkwo, was null and void.” Reuben said the appointment of Hilda Dokubo as the Chairman of the Steering Committee in Rivers State is illegal. He claimed that members of the National Working Committee of the Labour Party are behind Dienye Pepple, except the National Chairman. DAILY POST reports that Dienye Pepple’s faction of the Labour Party has taken over the state office, which was initially under locks.
