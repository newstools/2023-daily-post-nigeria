The Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps, NSCDC, has condemned illegal oil refining activities in Rumuekpe Community in the Emohua Local Government Area of Rivers State. Recall that there was an explosion in the community on Friday that claimed the lives of 12, as confirmed by the police command in the state. The Rivers State Commandant of the NSCDC, Michael Ogar, condemned the incident and the defiant behaviours of those engaging in artisanal refining in the community shortly after an assessment tour of the scene of the unfortunate incident. In a statement by the Public Relations Officer of the NSCDC State Command, Olufemi Ayodele, Ogar stated that the incident should be a lesson to perpetrators of such dangerous activity. He noted that the identities of the victims of the explosion are yet unknown. Commandant Ogar said several attempts had been made to combat illegal oil refining in the area, especially during the command anti-vandal operations, when several illegal refineries were destroyed. The Rivers State Commandant of the NSCDC further reiterated the need for collaborative efforts of security agencies to strengthen the fight against illegal dealings in petroleum products in the area and the entire state. Ogar called on the traditional institutions, opinion leaders and respective stakeholders to work together and end illegal oil refining activities in various communities across Rivers State.
