Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to demand the withdrawal of the threat to revoke the licenses of broadcast stations over coverage of Nigeria elections. The organisation told the President to call Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information, and the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to order. The NBC last week threatened to shut down media houses “if they continue to allow unpatriotic individuals on their platforms to make utterances that are subversive”. The government agency criticized “hateful, inciting, and negative conversations particularly in the post-2023 Presidential Election”. But SERAP said the “last warning” if not immediately withdrawn, would limit freedom of expression and the ability of broadcast stations to cover important issues around the 2023 general elections.” In a letter dated 11 March, deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare warned that NBC’s directive to outlets carrying out their “watchdog role” is incompatible with Nigeria’s constitutional and international human rights obligations. Oluwadare wondered how the media would provide a platform for the critical assessment of the electoral process if they are scared of penalties. The official said they expect that action would be taken within 48 hours of the receipt and/or publication of the letter. SERAP hinted a legal action to compel President Buhari to comply with its request if he fails to align with the public interest. “Your government has a legal responsibility to ensure an environment in which a diverse range of political opinions and ideas around the general elections can be freely and openly expressed and debated,” it added.
