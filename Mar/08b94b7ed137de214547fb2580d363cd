Operatives of the Adamawa State Police Command have arrested two suspected armed robbers allegedly terrorising commuters along the Mayo Belwa-Ngurore highway. The highway lies south of the state capital, Yola. The two suspects are Ibrahim Sajo and Isiaka Yunusa of Baputolo and Kona communities in Numan Local Government Area. The Police said Thursday that one other suspect escaped as the identified two were being picked up on Saturday the 4th March, 2023, shortly after their operation along the road in the night of that day. Ibrahim and the two other suspects had armed themselves with machetes and sticks, blocked the road, and started what they hoped would be another successful day of robbing travellers. It was gathered however that fate was unkind to them that day as after they succeeded in making away with a bag from one vehicle, moves that would land them in the hands of the law began. The suspects picked the bag and gave it to Ibrahim who tied it on his motorcycle and left the road, but while on his way back home, Ibrahim had a flat tyre and managed and entered a village and fixed it. He had another flat tire shortly after he had repaired the first one, as a result of which he entered a house and pleaded with a man there to keep the bag for him. He was however suspected by some vigilates in the community who arrested him, and he confessed to the crime. He was subsequently taken to the Police where he has further confessed that he and his other gang members had been operating on the same road. Spokesman of the Adamawa State Police Command, SP Suleiman Nguroje, said the state Commissioner of Police, CP Afolabi Adeniyi, had ordered that the suspects be charged to court.
