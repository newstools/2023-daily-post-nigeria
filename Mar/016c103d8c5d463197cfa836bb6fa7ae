Senator Suleiman Hunkuyi, the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) gubernatorial candidate in Kaduna State, has expressed concern over candidates using religion and tribe to woo the electorate in the March 18 governorship election in the state. He also blasted some religious bodies for endorsing some governorship candidates, describing the scenario as a bad omen to the future of democracy. He said that using religion or tribe in a complex state like Kaduna for electioneering was dangerous. Speaking to newsmen in Kaduna on Saturday, the gubernatorial candidate advised eligible voters to shun divisive politics and vote for a credible candidate that will move the state forward in all spheres of life. He explained that he believed in an inclusive government that would carry everybody along, irrespective of age, religion and tribe when elected as governor, stressing that it was the only way to ensure sustainable peace in the state. According to him, “I think you are aware of a letter by the Kaduna State Christian Association of Nigeria’s chairman, which endorsed the PDP governorship candidate. We also have an audio where some Muslim clergymen have also endorsed the candidate of APC for the governorship election in Kaduna State.” He wondered where the people would go when a governor that would emerge after the poll would be tagged a governor for Christians or for Muslims in a metropolitan state like Kaduna.
