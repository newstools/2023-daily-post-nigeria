Fulham winger Willian has said that leaving Chelsea was a huge mistake. The Brazilian said he should not have left Chelsea to join Arsenal nearly three years ago. Willian dumped Chelsea after seven trophy-laden years at Stamford Bridge after he was only offered a two-year contract. Arsenal pounced on the opportunity and offered him a three year contract and signed him on a free transfer. Willian endured a miserable time in North London and failed to thrive under the tutelage of Mikel Arteta. The attacker has been in excellent form since his return to London to Fulham and will come face-to-face with Arsenal at Craven Cottage tomorrow. Asked if he regretted leaving Chelsea, told Sky Sports: “Yeah I wish I’d never left…. I say to myself ‘I wish I never left,”
