A legal practitioner and social critic, Inibehe Effiong has reacted to claims by some persons that Igbos would want to take over Lagos from the Yorubas. Effiong questioned the sanity of those making the claims, wondering if they would use the military to forcefully chase out the Yorubas from Lagos. His statement is contained in a post via his verified Twitter handle on Monday. Recall that ahead of the March 11 gubernatorial election, some politicians in the State had alleged that Igbos planned to take over Lagos through the Labour Party, LP. One of them, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Femi Fani-Kayode, said his party would not allow the Labour Party, LP, governorship candidate in Lagos State, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, hand over the state to Igbos. Fani-Kayode claimed that Yorubas and Igbos were subjected to torture in the Southeast during the presidential election. In a series of tweets, the politician also claimed some Igbos were killed in the Southeast for voting for Bola Tinubu. However, Effiong described the claim as a silly propaganda, insisting that God gave human brains to reason well. He wrote, “How will the Igbos take over? Will the Igbos use the military to chase out the Yorubas from Lagos? Will they forcefully take over people’s lands and businesses? Will they sack traditional rulers in Lagos? God gave us brains to enable us reason. Stop parroting silly propaganda.”
