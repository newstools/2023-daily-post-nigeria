A Kwara State High Court sitting in Ilorin, has ordered Mustafa Salman Isowo Secretary to stop parading himself as state secretary of the All Progressives Congress. The order was sequel to a motion ex-parte filed by counsel to members of the APC in Alanamu Central Ward, Ilorin West Local Government Area of the state. DAILY POST recalls that members of the party in Alanamu Ward, after suspending Isowo on the allegation of anti-party activities, dragged the state chapter of the APC to court to prevent his further recognition. The originating summons dated February 16, 2023 and deposed to by one of the three claimants in the matter, Jaji Abdulganiy, on behalf of the party, in the ward asked the court to restrain the state chapter of the APC (2nd defendant), forthwith from further recognising Isowo as its secretary in the state. They asked the court to further declare that Isowo acting as the secretary of the 2nd defendant in spite of his suspension is “ultra vires, illegal, null and void”. In the order granted by Justice I. A. Yusuf on March 2, 2023, the court restrained the state chapter of the APC from recognising Isowo as the state secretary of the party, pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice already filed. The case was adjourned to March 13, 2023 for hearing of the case.
