Political Economist, Prof. Pat Utomi, has called for a review of the results of Saturday’s Presidential Election in ten states of the federation. Utomi, Convener of The BIG-TENT Coalition of Political Parties, Social Movements and Civil Society Organisations for Obi-Datti, made the call at a news conference on Friday in Lagos. He listed the states as Lagos, Rivers, Imo, Benue, Nasarawa, Plateau, Kaduna, Katsina, Adamawa and Akwa Ibom. Utomi said, “We want to urge INEC to show good faith and not wipe their server of activities of the Feb. 25 presidential election on the excuse of having it ready for March 11. “We also want to request that INEC administratively begin a review of the votes in 10 states. “All we seek is sunlight. We accuse none and come with malice toward none but are assured that our children will have better tomorrow if we ensure that sunlight and transparency define our electoral ways. “We ask for an INEC review. If this fails to bring justice, then a court process to reverse rigging and call the true winner. “Where that’s difficult for the system, we call for outright cancellation of the election of February 25 and ensuring that enthusiasm is allowed to flow through to March 11 with the assurance of a free, fair and transparent election.”
