Former federal lawmaker and a spokesperson for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP presidential campaign council for the just concluded election, Senator Dino Melaye has issued a stern warning to the Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike. Wike, who is the leader of the aggrieved governors elected on the platform of the PDP popularly known as G-5, had repeatedly attacked the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar for not allowing the opposition party to field a southern candidate. Wike and other members of the G-5 had, prior to the February 25th election, vowed to work against the former vice president. The Rivers Governor was said to have contributed to the victory of the candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu. Shortly after the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC announced Tinubu as president-elect, Wike mocked Atiku saying he owes nobody an apology. However, Dino in a tweet on Tuesday night said the G-5 were not relevant in the elections. Issuing a “last warning” to Wike, Dino asked the governor to bury his head in shame, citing how some members of the G-5 failed in the election. He wrote, “Wike should bury his head in shame and shut up. I warn him to stop insulting Atiku, enough is enough. Last warning. G-5 has no relevance in the just concluded presidential election. “The G5 who could not deliver themselves for their senate bid cannot be the ones claiming glory in purported Atiku loss. Even Wike outside thuggery and coercion of INEC officials had nothing to contribute to APC votes in Rivers”. [sic].
