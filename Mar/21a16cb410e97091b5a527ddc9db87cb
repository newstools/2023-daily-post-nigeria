The death toll from the Thursday morning accident in Lagos involving a train and bus has risen to six. The bus conveying staff of the Lagos State Government collided with an oncoming train at the PWD rail crossing in the Shogunle area. While heading to Alausa from Isolo, the driver took a wrong turn at the PWD rail crossing in Shogunle and hit the train, eyewitnesses said. The vehicle had 85 passengers on board, mostly civil servants and some dependents. Two died on the spot, four died in the hospital. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu gave an update when he visited the survivors at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, LASUTH. The governor announced there are 42 moderately-injured persons, 29 serious injuries and eight mild injuries. Twenty-five persons have been treated and transferred to Gbagada General Hospital, Agege General Hospital, and Trauma Centre at the toll gate. Sanwo-Olu declared three days of mourning, ordering flags across the state to fly at half-mast. He further declared Friday work-free and cancelled all public engagements and campaigns for the March 18 governorship election.
