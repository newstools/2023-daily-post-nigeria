The Benue State Government has handed over the Aper Aku Stadium, Makurdi to a contractor for renovation works. The renovation works will be handled by Moni Michelle Sports. It would be recalled that the state government, owner of Lobi Stars Football Club recently approved the sum of N24m for the upgrading of the Aper Aku Stadium with modern facilities. Lobi Stars have been playing their home games at the New Jos Stadium this season after the Aper Aku Stadium failed to meet the Interim Management Committee (IMC) requirements. Mohammed Baba Ganaruâ€™s side is expected to return to their home turf before the end of the season. Lobi Stars currently sit on the summit of the Nigerian Premier Football League (NPFL) Group B table.
