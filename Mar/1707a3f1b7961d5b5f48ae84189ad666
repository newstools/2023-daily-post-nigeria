A Nigerian on-air personality, Kayode Ojuolape Oladotun, popularly known as Do2dtun has reacted to the recent donation of transformers by the Lagos lawmaker representing the Surulere I constituency at the State legislature, Desmond Elliot a few days before the election. Desmond, who is running for a third term as Lagos lawmaker, had Thursday donated transformers to his constituency. Announcing the commissioning of the transformers in a post shared on social media, Desmond said he had commissioned the instalment of high capacity transformers in Surulere. “I am excited to announce that new high-capacity transformers have been installed in Surulere, bringing reliable electricity to communities that have long needed it,” he said. Reacting through a tweet on his Twitter handle, Do2dtun stated that the lawmaker was making a donation only to buy his constituency’s votes. ”Desmond, who couldn’t buy a power bank for his constituency, suddenly buys eight transformers at once a few days before the election. Isn’t it obvious that these guys don’t care. Desmond Import and export,” he added.
