Manchester United manager, Erik ten Hag, has reacted to their 7-0 defeat at Liverpool. Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah and Darwin Nunez all scored twice as the Reds recorded a huge win at Anfield. Ten Hag has explained why they lost heavily against Jurgen Klopp’s men. “I think we played a decent first half. [We committed] one mistake in organisation just before half-time. “Second half it was just not us. It was not our standards. We didn’t play as a team. “It was unprofessional. Yes [I am angry]. Definitely. “We didn’t stick to the plan and we didn’t do our jobs. We didn’t track back and it was really unprofessional,” Ten Hag told BBC MOTD.
