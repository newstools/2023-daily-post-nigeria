The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has said they have learnt lessons from the conduct of the 2023 presidential elections last week. INEC chairman, Yakubu Mahmood, stated this on Saturday while addressing a press conference. Mahmood admitted they faced logistics and technical issues during the Saturday, February 25 polls. “The issues of logistics, election technology, the behaviour of some election personnel at different levels, the attitude of some party agents and supporters added to the extremely challenging environment in which elections are usually held in Nigeria,” Mahmood said. He added that “a lot of lessons have been learnt.” Mahmood promised that the challenges will be addressed during “the general election involving the largest number of constituencies i.e. 28 State Governorship elections and 993 State Houses of Assembly seats.”
