Old Trafford legend, Gary Neville has named Casemiro as Manchester United’s most important player this season. He also named former Real Madrid and France international, Raphael Varane as the Red Devils’ most important option in defence. Casemiro moved to Old Trafford from Real Madrid for a fee of £70 million last summer and has been so influential for Erik ten Hag’s side. The Brazil international scored in Manchester United’s Carabao Cup final against Newcastle United on Sunday to help the club end their six-year wait for a trophy. Neville named Marcus Rashford and Casemiro as United’s most important players this season, with Varane and David de Gea sharing third spot. “In order, I would go Casemiro, I would go Rashford, I’d go de Gea and Varane equal third at this moment in time,” Neville told Sky Sports.
