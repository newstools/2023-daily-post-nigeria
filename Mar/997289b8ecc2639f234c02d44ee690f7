The son of Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State, Bashir, has suggested that Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State is saving the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Bashir disclosed that Wike could be the anointed messiah that would revive PDP’s lost glory. Wike has been at loggerheads with the PDP leadership since he lost the party’s presidential ticket. Following his defeat at the PDP primaries, Wike had refused to support the party’s flagbearer, Atiku Abubakar. Wike and his G-5 governors also demanded the resignation of PDP National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu. The governors said Ayu should resign and allow a southerner to take over the party’s leadership. They noted that the North can’t produce PDP’s presidential candidate and national chairman. Due to the fallout, Wike had distanced himself from Atiku during the just-concluded presidential election. However, Bashir tweeted: “Wike could turn out to be the anointed messiah that will revive the PDP’s lost glory. “He stood by his principles & for the sake of the health of our democracy, the opposition should be robust. I truly wish him & his team of patriots well.”
