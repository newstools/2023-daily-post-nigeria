The Bauchi State Police Command has declared a House of Representatives member, Yakubu Abdullahi Shehu wanted for alleged murder. The security agency also placed a bounty of N1 million on the lawmaker representing Bauchi federal constituency. Shehu was elected on the platform of the Peoples Redemption Party (PDP) but defected to All Progressives Congress (APC). A Special Police Gazette Bulletin CB: 2685/Bsx/VOL.T/4s was issued on Tuesday by Police Public Relations Officer, SP Ahmed Wakil. The bulletin said the Nigeria Police Force, under the authority of the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, is searching for Shehu. The politician is wanted in connection with a case of “criminal conspiracy, causing grievous hurt, inciting disturbances of public peace and culpable homicide”. The police want “valid information that will lead to his arrest for interrogation and arraignment on criminal charges”. “Anyone with information that could assist in his arrest should please contact 08151849417 or report at any nearest police station,” the bulletin adds. DAILY POST recalls the police, in May 2022, detained Haruna Mohammed, publisher of WikkiTimes, and Idris Kamal, a journalist with the news outlet. The duo were arrested after honouring an invitation over a report titled ‘How Bauchi APC Chairman Died After Series of Threats’. It detailed how Hussaini Musa Gwaba, APC chairman in Bauch received a series of threats before he was finally murdered. The report said “the emergence of Gwaba as chairman angered Hon. Yakubu Shehu Abdullahi, a member representing Bauchi Federal Constituency”. Abdullahi reportedly believed the deceased was a threat to his political ambition and joined forces with other aggrieved members to run a parallel election to install a chairman.
