The Nationwide League has fixed March 20th for the start of the medical assessment for all players in the division. The medical assessment is a pre-condition for players to participate in League One. The NLO is expected to roll out dates of assessment for each state on Monday, March 13, and the designated centres to be agreed upon by the respective State Football Association. The NLO is the third-tier league in Nigeria after the Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) and Nigeria National League (NNL). It would be recalled that Aspire FC, FC One Rocket, Hype Buzz FC, FC Ebedei, Madiba FC; Mailantarki Care FC, Police Barretta FC and Smart FC gained promotion to the NNL from NLO last season.
