The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Wednesday arraigned Abdulsalam Saleh Abdulkarim before Justice Mohammed Nasir Yunusa of the Federal High Court in Kano. The defendant, popularly known as A. A. Zaura, was arraigned on a four-count charge of obtaining by false pretence. In August 2014 in Kano, Zaura allegedly obtained the sum of $200,000 from Dr Jamman Al-Azmi, claiming he had the capacity to partner with him for a joint venture business. The EFCC said the representation was false and contrary to Section 1[1)(a) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act, 2006, and punishable under Section 1(3) of the same Act. Zaura pleaded not guilty to the charges when it was read to him. Prosecution Aisha Tahar Habib then asked for a trial date. Counsel representing the defendant, Ishaq Mudi Dikko, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, applied for bail on behalf of his client. After arguments, Justice Yunusa ruled that the defendant should continue with the bail terms earlier granted to him by the court. The matter has been adjourned till May 2, 2023, for the commencement of retrial. The defendantâ€™s trial is starting afresh after the Court of Appeal nullified his acquittal by Justice A. L. Allagoa of the Federal High Court. Zaura allegedly defrauded a Kuwaiti citizen of $1,320,000 under the pretext that he was building properties in Dubai, Kuwait and other Arab countries.
