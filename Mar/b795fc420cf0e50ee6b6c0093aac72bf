The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the just-concluded general election, Atiku Abubakar, has said they are ready to form an alliance with Peter Obi of the Labour Party, LP. Atiku made this claim while speaking during a press conference on Thursday. “I don’t think we will have any problem if he (Obi) wants to dialogue with PDP — either form an alliance or not,” he said. Obi was Atiku’s running mate during the 2019 presidential election. However, this time around, both men were fighting for the PDP ticket before Obi decamped to LP. Atiku finished second in the poll behind declared winner Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress, APC, while Obi came third. The two men are heading to court to contest the official INEC results.
