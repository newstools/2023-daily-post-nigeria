Ahead of the March 11 governorship and House of Assembly polls, a leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Delta State and the Ologbotsere of Warri Kingdom, Chief Ayirimi Emami, has called for collaboration between supporters of the APC and Labour Party, LP to enable Delta State’s APC governorship candidate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, emerge victorious at the Polls and ultimately wipe out Governor Ifeanyi Okowa’s political hegemony. Chief Emami made the call on Wednesday, March 1, at the Ologbotsere Hall in his palatial home in Warri, Delta State, during a special traditional thanksgiving held by the Ologbotsere Descendants, to appreciate God and the ancestors for the victory of Bola Ahmed Tinubu as Nigeria’s President-elect. He said the thanksgiving became necessary because they sought the blessings of the ancestors to grant Tinubu victory, before the presidential election held on Saturday, February 25, assuring that the Itsekiri nation would recover everything it lost with Tinubu as president. Whilst stating that Tinubu’s emergence as President-elect has brought blessing to the Itsekiri nation, Chief Emami expressed optimism that his Presidency, would lead to the actualization of the much talked about Koko-Ogheye Road, Warri to Ugborodo Road and completion of the Trans-Warri Ode-Itsekiri bridges and access roads. He thanked members of the respected Itsekiri Leaders of Thought, ILOT, led by Chief Edward Ekpoko, a former member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Daniel Reyenieju, Delta South APC chieftain, Prince Yemi Emiko, a leader of the party in Warri South-West Local Government Area, Engr. Tuoyo Omatsuli, MessrsCanaan Ajagbawa and Billy Emami as well as the people of Itsekiri communities such as Orugbo, Okere, Ugborodo, Ubeji, Ifie, Jakpa, Ebrohimi, Bowen Avenue and Odion Road, for working assiduously towards the triumph of Tinubu/Shettima just as he urged them to do the same for Senator Ovie Omo-Agege and APC state House of Assembly candidates on Saturday, March 11.
