Ward collation officers of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State have called for the cancellation of the just concluded House of Representatives election in Obio/Akpor. The APC Ward 2 Collation Officer, Hanachor Francis-Eleto and Ward 10 Collation Officer, Stanley Worgu, in a press briefing in Port Harcourt, alleged that they were denied access to the collation centre. The two collation officers also said officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, assisted members of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to manipulate the process. Francis-Eleto and Worgu, who spoke on behalf of other ward collation officers, also alleged that presiding officers were not seen anywhere close to polling units. They claimed that members of the PDP, in collaboration with security agencies, shut the entrance of the secretariat against them before chasing them away. They described the election of last Saturday as a disaster and undemocratic, stating that INEC failed with their promise that election results will be uploaded and transmitted at the polling units. “The PDP stalwarts did not allow us to man our polling units. It started all the way from our polling units. [With] the amount of violence that they came with, they came to hijack both the BVAS and the ballot boxes. “What shocked me is that in most of these places, they even came with security personnel. INEC security supported them to move these things,” Worgu alleged.
