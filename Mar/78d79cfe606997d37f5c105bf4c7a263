A Nigerian Army personnel, Lance Corporal Nwobodo Chinonso has killed three soldiers and himself. Chinonso is reported to have opened fire and killed Lt. Sam Oladapo and others at the weekend. Oladapo was the Commander of the Forward Operating Base (FOB) Rabah in Sokoto State. He also shot the FOB Command Sergeant Major (CSM), Sgt. Iliyasu Inusa, and a private soldier, Attahiru Mohammed. After killing his colleagues, the shooter turned the gun to himself and committed suicide. A source told PRNigeria that the Commander 8 Division Garrison and Commander 26 Battalion are at the base. The remains of the victims have been removed to the Usmanu Danfodiyo Teaching Hospital; an investigation has commenced. A senior officer in Sokoto Division suggested the soldier may have been battling “operational and psychological stress”. “It is something that is common in the military. But that’s not a justification for any of our soldiers to go haywire,” he said.
