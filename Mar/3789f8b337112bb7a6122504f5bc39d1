The Lagos State Police Command on Saturday arrested a 36-year-old man who allegedly specialised in snatching cars at gunpoint. The commandâ€™s spokesperson, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, confirmed the arrest on Tuesday in Lagos. He said the suspect was apprehended by operatives of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) after he and two of his accomplices, now at large, hijacked two vehicles at gunpoint. The suspect, he affirmed, was arrested on Saturday, at Ojodu-Berger shortly after his gang snatched a 2003 Toyota Corolla. According to the police spokesman, the suspects had arrived in a 2005 Toyota Camry which they earlier snatched from an unsuspecting citizen at gunpoint at Oworo. He avowed that owners of the vehicles recovered can come with proof of ownership to claim their vehicles while assuring that effort is still ongoing to arrest the two fleeing suspects.
