The Lagos State government has given a reason why Chrisland School, Ikeja, Lagos, will remain shut. Commissioner for Education, Folasade Adefisayo, in a statement at the weekend, said the school would remain shut until the Lagos State government is satisfied that the lives of students in the school are not endangered and other safety concerns are addressed. Adefisayo also said a number of steps had been taken by the Lagos government since February 10 when it got the report of the death of Whitney Adeniran, a 12-year-old pupil of the school. The statement read in part, “On February 10, 2023, the Lagos State government received a report of the death of Whitney Omodesola Adeniran, a 12-year-old student of Chrisland High School, who was said to have slumped during her school’s inter-house sports competition on February 9, 2023. “The school was also closed to students since the incident borders on safety of children. “It was discovered that there were lapses. In view of the findings of the autopsy report, dated March 1, 2023, which revealed the cause of death as asphyxia and electrocution, the Hon. Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice directed that the Directorate of Public Prosecutions issues Legal Advice on the matter. “On March 2, 2023, the Hon. Commissioner, Ministry of Education led a delegation to commiserate with Whitney’s family and to directly convey Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s commitment to ensuring justice for Whitney. “Without prejudice to the criminal proceedings, the state government’s position is to the effect that the secondary school will remain closed to further interrogate endangerment of students and other concerns.”
