Former Barcelona coach, Luis Enrique and former Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane are both ‘in the running’ to become the new Chelsea manager. According to Sport, Enrique and Zidane are now the latest big names to be linked to the Chelsea job, as both men are in contention to replace Potter. Potter is currently under intense pressure at Chelsea following the club’s poor form of results this season. Chelsea are currently in 10th position in the Premier League table with 14 points behind the top four. The Blues also suffered early elimination from both the FA Cup and the Carabao Cup, while in the Champions League, they are 1-0 down to Borussia Dortmund after their first-leg last-16 tie last month. Chelsea’s hierarchy have repeatedly backed Potter despite a recent emergency meeting over the club’s bad form but they are now starting to have doubts over the Englishman’s future at the club. However, according to the latest report, Enrique and Zidane, who are not managing any club at the moment, are linked with the Chelsea job. Enrique was most recently the manager of the Spain national team and stepped down after their exit from the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar in the last 16. Zidane, on the other hand, has been out of work since leaving Real Madrid in 2021.
