Manchester United legend, Patrice Evra, has claimed he is not delusional enough to think his former club can win the Premier League this season. Evra stated this following Manchester United’s Premier League 7-0 defeat against Liverpool on Sunday. Speaking on Rio Ferdinand’s FIVE podcast, Evra said: “I never got carried away. With this team, they are going in the right direction, but they are not yet ready [to win the Premier League]. I am not delusional. “As a United fan, I will think about the title, but I will be honest with you, I never think United will be able to win [this season], because it is a process.” The result against Liverpool means Man United are in third position on the Premier League table with 49 points from 25 games.
