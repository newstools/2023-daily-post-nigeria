The PDP stalwart in Niger, however, cautioned those peddling such false rumour to desist as he is very much committed to seeing to the success of his party in the forthcoming state governorship and state assembly elections. He then called on Nigerlites to come out en masse to vote for all candidates of the PDP at all levels in the next elections in the state.
