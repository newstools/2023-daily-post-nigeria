Chelsea attacking midfielder, Mason Mount, is increasingly likely to leave Stamford Bridge this summer as both parties are yet to agree on a new contract. This claim was made by respected football transfer guru, Fabrizio Romano. Romano, in a tweet via his Twitter account on Monday, said that Mount would be on the transfer market this summer if a new deal is not agreed upon before the end of the season. Mount has just less than 18 months left on his current contract with the west London club. “There’s still big gap in the negotiations between Chelsea and Mason Mount, as new deal is again far from being agreed,” Romano tweeted. “No final decision yet but chances of Mason Mount leaving Chelsea are increasing. Mount will be on the market if a new deal is not agreed before the summer.”
