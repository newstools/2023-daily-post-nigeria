A former member of the House of Representatives and chieftain of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Abia State, Hon Damian Anayo Ozurumba, has decamped to the opposition Young Progressives Party, YPP, in the state. He decamped to YPP alongside hundreds of PDP members and supporters across the wards of Isiala Ngwa South Local Government Area of Abia State. Ozurumba who was also an executive member of the Southeast zonal chapter of the PDP, announced his defection when he received the main gubernatorial candidate of YPP, Engr Enyinnaya Nwafor at his home in Mbutu community in Isiala Ngwa South LGA of the state. Speaking during the colourful event, Ozurumba rallied maximum support for the election of Nwafor in the upcoming March 11, 2023, governorship poll, describing the YPP flagbearer as best among all candidates jostling for the number one seat of Abia State, having demonstrated capacity as a private businessman. His words: “I have searched, I have weighed their characters and preparedness. Nana is the best of all. “For us to realize an Abia where pensions and salaries are paid, where teachers will be paid and hospitals function. We will be supporting Nana to be elected Governor of Abia State.” Appreciating the former House of Representatives member and his crowd of supporters, the Abia Young Progressives Party governorship candidate, Enyinnaya Nwafor described Ozurumba as a brother and assured he will disappoint Abia people if given the chance to emerge as the next governor of the state in the forthcoming election. He said: “This mammoth crowd inspires us to do more. We have no reason to let you down. I am super proud of my brother, toto. May Abia win.” The highlight of the ceremony was the handing over of the Onuoha Foundation Network structure to the YPP flagbearer ahead of the main election fixed for March 11, 2023, by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC.
