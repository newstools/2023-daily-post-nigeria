A former Senator of Kaduna Central, Shehu Sani, said opposition parties would not tolerate any form of intimidation by the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC. Sani said the APC lost in Kaduna during the presidential and National Assembly elections held on February 25. According to him, the ruling party is currently attempting to use security as a means of intimidating members of the opposition because of Saturday’s governorship and House of Assembly polls. “The APC lost election in Kaduna on the 25th of February; attempts to use security agents in order to intimidate and harass members of the opposition because of the 11th of March Governorship election will not be tolerated. @OfficialDSSNG @PoliceNG,” he said. Sani stated further that security agents yesterday arrested the Media Director of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Kaduna State, Saidu Adamu. He disclosed in a tweet that two youths, who are members of the PDP, have also been arrested, urging law enforcement agents to allow free and fair elections in Kaduna State. “Yesterday in Kaduna, security agents have arrested the Media Director of the State PDP campaign Committee Hon Saidu Adamu, an ex Commissioner. They have also arrested two youth leaders, El Abbas Muhammed and Talib. Agents should allow free elections in Kaduna,” Sani said.
