Manchester City legend, Yaya Toure, has backed his former club to win the Premier League title ahead of Arsenal this season. Toure believes Arsenal will drop points, adding that there is a long way to go amid the title race between the Gunners and Man City. Arsenal are currently five points ahead of Man City on the Premier League table with 12 games remaining. “At the moment, it’s really tight. Man City are just playing really well and are hoping Arsenal will drop points,” Toure told talkSPORT. “I think Arsenal will drop points. It’s a long way still, the pressure is there. Man United are still doing well, Liverpool [had] a brilliant result a few days ago, and Arsenal are competing fantastically well. “I don’t want to say it’s a decider of the league, as it is a long way to go. I hope Man City will do it because I am a fan of Man City.”
