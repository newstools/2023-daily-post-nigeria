A Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Pius Akubo has rejected the appointment to the legal team of the President-elect, Bola Tinubu. A few days ago, the All Progressives Congress, APC, had constituted its Presidential Election Petition Team. Akubo was one of the 12 legal luminaries with vast experience in election matters, constitutional laws, and litigation constituted by the APC. The legal team is expected to defend Tinubu’s win in the last presidential election. However, Akubo said he was unaware of the appointment, stressing that Tinubu’s camp has not officially informed him. In a statement, Akubo said: “In the last twenty-four hours or so, the social media space has been agog with a trending unsigned letter in respect of appointment of Presidential Election Petition Legal Team by APC, wherein my name is listed as number 10. “With all due respect, I wish to state that I had no prior knowledge of the said appointment. As a matter of fact, I have not received any official communication on the subject matter hitherto.” Akubo stressed that he can’t defend the President-elect due to personal reasons. “In the circumstance and for personal reasons, I hereby decline the said appointment,” he added.
