After the governorship candidate of the Labour Party in Adamawa State, Umar Mustapha, stepped down for his APC counterpart, Aishatu Ahmed Binani, on Sunday, six minor candidates have similarly stepped down their ambition, this time, for Gov Ahmadu Fintiri, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In Adamawa State, Binani and Fintiri are rated as the two major candidates while Umar Ardo of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Umar Mustapha of the Labour Party come distant third and fourth in popularity rating. Mohammed Tahir of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) and Ibrahim Baba-Inna of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) are further down the ladder with eight others even lower. Six out of these eight candidates announced their decision to step down for Fintiri during a ceremony on Wednesday. They include Bello Babajo of Allied Peoples Movement (APM), Yahaya Choli of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Maina Aliyu Abba of National Rescue Movement (NRM), Amron Dadsu of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), Muhammad Shuwa of Action Democratic Party (ADP) and Abdulkadir Adam of Action Peoples Party (APP). Speaking at the event in Government House, Yola, Governor Fintiri saluted his co-contenders for stepping down for him, adding that he would not take their sacrifice for granted. In his remark on behalf of the candidates, Bello Babajo (APM) said their decision was borne out of the desire for the progress of the state.
