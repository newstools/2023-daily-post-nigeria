Former Chelsea defender, Glen Johnson, has insisted that the Blues would rather sell midfielder Mason Mount for £100 million than see him leave Stamford Bridge for free. Mount is likely to leave Chelsea this summer transfer window after talks between his representatives and the west London club hit a wall over a contract extension. The England World Cup star has less than 18 months left on his current contract with Chelsea, and he has made it clear that his preference is to remain at the club. But Johnson believes it is better to sell Mount if he is not signing a new contract. “The clock is ticking and Chelsea need to be bold regarding the business side of it,” Johnson told Betfred. He added: “In 2024, if Mason’s contract does expire, then he would probably go to a rival Premier League club for free anyway. If he does not sign a new deal, then Chelsea may as well bite the bullet and take the money for him because you would rather sell him for £100 million, than see him leave for free. “The club will probably try and do the best deal they can this summer, in terms of selling him for good money or getting him to re-sign. They can’t risk letting him leave for free.”
