The leadership of Labour Party (LP) in Adamawa State has distanced itself from endorsement of the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in the state, Senator Aishatu Ahmed Binani. The state LP governorship candidate, Engr Umar Mustapha said at a press briefing on Sunday that he had dropped his ambition and offered his campaign structures to Binani. The LP leadership in the state on Wednesday, however, condemned such an endorsement by Umar Mustapha, saying the party had nothing to do with it. The state chairman of the Labour Party, Mr Christopher Nicholas said: “We have no faction in the state. Those who went to another party are not the exco of this party.” The state organising secretary of the party, Ezra Vandi, who also spoke at the press briefing, said the party was yet to decide what to do about Umar Mustapha’s disposition to endorsing candidates of APC. DAILY POST recalls that Umar Mustapha had earlier endorsed the presidential candidate of APC, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu and disowned LP’s Peter Obi, the LP state organising secretary added that the LP would in due course take a position against him. It remained unclear up to Wednesday afternoon what the status of Umar Mustapha was with regards to LP membership. When he was asked by journalists on Sunday whether his ditching his LP governorship ticket meant that he was also no longer a member of LP, he refused to give an answer.
