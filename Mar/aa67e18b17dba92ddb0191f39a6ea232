Former Premier League referee, Graham Poll, has claimed Arsenal were “let down” by VAR, in their 3-2 comeback win against Bournemouth. Reiss Nelson netted a last-gasp winner as the Gunners maintained their five-point lead over Manchester City. Mikel Arteta’s men conceded the quickest goal this season when Philip Billing scored within the opening nine seconds of the game. But Poll believed the goal should not have stood. A number of Bournemouth players appeared to have strayed into Arsenal’s half before kick-off and Poll believed referee Chris Kavanagh and his officials should have spotted them. “VAR once again appeared to let Arsenal FC down again on Saturday as both the on-field referee, Chris Kavanagh, and his colleagues at Stockley Park failed to punish the FACT that a number of Bournemouth players were in the opposing half before the kick-off at the start of the match,” Poll told BettingSites.co.uk.
