A chief magistrate court presided over by Ibrahim Mansur, has remanded the House of Representatives Majority Leader, Alhassan Ado Doguwa on a five-count charge that included culpable homicide. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Kano State Police Command docked Doguwa, alleged to have attacked his constituents on election day leading to the killing of three persons while others were burnt alive. Charged at Magistrate Court 53, he is alleged of criminal conspiracy, culpable homicide, causing grievous hurt, mischief by firearm and inciting disturbances, setting the NNPP office on fire, shooting one to death and seriously injuring others. The prosecution counsel had applied to the court to remand the suspect at a correctional facility, pending the conclusion of investigations on the matter by the state’s Attorney General. The accused’s counsel, Barrister Abdul Adamu, however, argued that he should be granted bail on self-recognition as a member of the House of Representatives as well as member-elect of the 10th National Assembly. The presiding magistrate, after hearing arguments from both sides on the bail application, adjourned the case to March 7.
