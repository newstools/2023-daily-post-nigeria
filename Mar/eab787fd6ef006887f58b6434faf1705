Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, has named Newcastle United as the ‘best team in the Premier League’. Guardiola stated this ahead of Man City’s Premier League tie with Newcastle United on Saturday. According to the Spaniard, Newcastle have a strong mentality, transitions and threats. “The threats, transitions, set pieces – they are the best team in the league,” Guardiola said about Newcastle United during his pre-match press conference on Friday. Guardiola added: ‘They’ve not been here a long time [near the top four] and you always think they need time, but they’ve done exceptional recruitment, experienced players, exactly what they need. “A manager [Eddie Howe] with huge quality. It is maybe a surprise but not anymore and I think they will stay there. “They are one of the toughest opponents we’ve to the end of the season. The mentality, transitions, and threats. They are one of the best teams. That is why they are there.”
