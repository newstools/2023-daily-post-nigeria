The Ohanaeze Ndigbo has assured that the Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate, Peter Obi would reclaim his stolen mandate in court. Obi came third in the 2023 presidential election behind Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and winner, Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress, APC. Reacting to the outcome of the election, Obi had rejected the result of the election, stressing that he won the poll. He vowed to contest Tinubu’s victory at the election tribunal. Reacting, Ohanaeze’s National Publicity Secretary, Alex Ogbonnia, said the apex Igbo organization is prepared to go full length with Obi in his push to reclaim his mandate. Speaking with journalists yesterday, Ogbonnia stressed that Nigerians believe in Obi. According to Ogbonnia: “I have confidence in that because when he was deprived of his victory sometime in Anambra State, he struggled and assured people that he would recover it. Later on, he recovered that mandate. The same way, it is like history repeating itself. “Anybody who has known Peter Obi will know that he is always sure of whatever he is doing. He is conscious of whatever position or decision he is taking. “He is not a man of frivolities or a man who takes decisions anyhow. He takes a thorough review of his decisions before making it public.”
