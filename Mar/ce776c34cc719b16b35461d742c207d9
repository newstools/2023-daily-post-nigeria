The Iwo Traditional Council has called on the Osun State Governor, Ademola Adeleke to lift his executive order on some monarchs who have been denied their entitlements. DAILY POST recalls that Governor Adeleke during his inauguration on November 27, 2022 put on hold the coronation of monarchs in the state. The appeal was contained in a communique issued by the council on Tuesday, shortly after its monthly meeting at the Oluwo’s palace in Iwo, Osun State. The governor had through an Executive Order he issued on his inauguration also suspended the coronation of monarchs including the Akirun of Ikinrun, Aree or Iree and Owa of Igbajo land. The order also affected three monarchs in Iwo Traditional Council; Olupo, Alawuje and Alaya. He also days later inaugurated a Review Committee to look into the process of installation of the monarchs and submit recommendations. The Council which is headed by the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Adewale Akanbi also appealed to the governor to repeal the executive order on selected monarchs in Osun State. The council lamented that three monarchs have not been given their salary and other entitlements due to their office from the state government. “We call on Governor Adeleke to suspend his executive order on some monarchs in Osun State. The order is tantamount to slowing down the monarchical administration of the affected cities. We appeal to Gov. Adeleke to return the full paraphernalia of kingship and honour the Iwo Traditional Council by suspending the order. “The affected monarchs are not too pleased. Even at a salary, monarchs are striving to survive. And we don’t want our traditional rulers to engage in land grabbing/sales. We beg your good office to consider our plea by granting our modest request.”
