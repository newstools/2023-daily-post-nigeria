Popular Nigerian afrobeat singer Seun Kuti has broken his silence following the outcome of the 2023 presidential election. Speaking in a post shared on his Instagram page to address Nigerians, the singer, who had earlier stated that he was a fool when he campaigned in 1999 for Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the former governor of Lagos State, noted that Nigerians wanted the lesser of three evils but got the best of the evil. Seun wrote: “When you realize all your actors, musicians, politicians, business leaders, influencers, comedians are using your support and resources to become American and British citizens, so their children don’t exist with yours, maybe you will have sense enough to stop allowing them to direct your life. You wanted the lesser of the three evils, but you got the best.”
