Shooting Stars head coach, Gbenga Ogunbote, has stressed that the club has to better its performance in the second half of the season. The Oluyole Warriors struggled to get going in the first stanza. Ogunbote told DAILY POST that the team must have a better second-round outing to finish in a respectable position on the table. “We must do better than what we did in the first round of the season,” Ogunbote stated. “It’s not a mind game, I just like to set realistic targets, we have to look at the previous position of the club. “The target that is being expressed to the public is not always the same that worked internally, and it goes with the saying that if you aim beyond the sky when you fall, you fall among the stars, and that has always been a guide. “It is compulsory we have a better second-half outing to finish in an appreciable place.” Shooting Stars will begin the second stanza with a trip to Uyo against Akwa United.
