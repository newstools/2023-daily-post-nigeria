Former Manchester United defender, Paul Parker, has urged head coach Erik ten Hag to remove midfielder Bruno Fernandes as captain and install goalkeeper David de Gea as the Red Devils’ skipper. Parker said Fernandes is childish and a brat, adding that he is not a leader. Fernandes’ attitude was heavily criticized in Manchester United’s historic Premier League 7-0 defeat to Liverpool on 5 March. The Portugal international was seen arguing with the match referee time and again and refused to track back at times, committing about three fouls out of frustration. “First of all, I was saying from day one that Bruno Fernandes should not have been the captain. He’s not a leader, and this is the reason why it took him that long to get to a big club like Man United,” Parker told Apostagolos. “People are trying to protect him by saying that he is the best player, he is making assists, and so on. But the truth is that he has been childish and petulant with the way he throws himself to the ground and blames the referees. He’s a brat.” “He prefers to walk around and kick people, complain and give up. He gave up against Liverpool, which is miserable. Parker continued: “David De Gea should be the captain. He’s acting like a captain and he is actually trying to calm people down.”
