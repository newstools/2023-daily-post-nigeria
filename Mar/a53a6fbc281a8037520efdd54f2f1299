Centre-back, Abel Ogwuche scooped the Man of the Match award following Nigeriaâ€™s victory against the Hippos of Uganda at the Suez Canal Stadium, Ismailia on Thursday night. The Flying Eagles defeated the CECAFA champions 1-0 to seal a place in the semi-finals and a berth at the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup. Ogwuche made his first appearance at the 2023 Africa U-20 Cup of Nations replacing suspended captain, Daniel Bamaiyi at the heart of Flying Eagles defence. The Trelleborgs of Sweden defender slotted in perfectly, helping to ward off the threat of the Ugandans strikers. Ogwuche made a number of vital blocks in the game especially in the second half. It remains to be seen if Ogwuche will keep his place in the team for the semi-finals.
