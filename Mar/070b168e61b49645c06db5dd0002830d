Tottenham Hotspur are not willing to sell Harry Kane this summer, according to Sky Sports. The Premier League side want to hold onto the England captain regardless of whether he signs a new contract or where they finish in the Premier League. Kane will enter the final year of his current deal at the end of the season and talks over extending at the club are currently on ice. Spurs view Kane’s presence and contribution as more valuable than the transfer fee he could potentially bring in. Manchester United, who are long-term admirers of Kane, retain a strong interest in the 29-year-old but are eager to avoid a ‘nightmare’ situation over a priority position. Red Devils boss Erik ten Hag wants a striker signed as early as possible and his ideal scenario is to have new signings in place for the bulk of pre-season.
