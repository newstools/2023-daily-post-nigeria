All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Oyo State, Teslim Folarin has denied planning to bring back the Seriki Fulani of Ibarapa. The Fulani leader, Salihu AbdulKadir was chased out of the town in January 2021 by Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Igboho. Igboho, who was later arrested in Benin Republic for secession activities, then accused AbdulKadir of sponsoring kidnapping in and around Ibarapa. On Tuesday, Folarin also debunked reports that he would abolish the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) campus in Iseyin. The Senator, in a statement by his spokesperson Yekeen Olaniyi, called the claims “another propaganda taken too far”. The APC flagbearer noted that LAUTECH Ogbomoso belongs to every zone of Oyo, appealing to the people to rest assured. He said the LAUTECH Faculty of Agriculture in Iseyin and the Oyo State College of Agriculture and Technology (OYSCATECH) in Igboora were in his agenda for agriculture. On the ousted Seriki Fulani, Folarin said a photo showing both of them was taken during a peace meeting with Yoruba and Hausa-Fulani leaders from Ibarapa. “The poster printed by our opponent with the caption “Folarin to Bring Back Seriki Fulani to Ibarapa”…is fake news,” he asserted. Folarin added that a major party was behind the rumours, warning them to desist from a campaign of calumny.
