Paris Saint-Germain are planning a stunning Â£175m swoop for Manchester City striker Erling Haaland. The French champions saw their Champions League dream end this week by Bayern Munich. PSG failed to score over two legs as the Bundesliga side progressed with a 3-0 aggregate. Their elimination has sparked fresh questions about whether the Qatari takeover can, so far, be considered a success. With the Holy Grail of the Champions League trophy remaining ever elusive, it appears the club has set its sights on Haaland. According to French reporter Daniel Riolo, PSG are exploring the options of pairing Haaland with Kylian Mbappe. It has been suggested that both Neymar and Lionel Messi could be moved on this summer to accommodate the Norwegian.
