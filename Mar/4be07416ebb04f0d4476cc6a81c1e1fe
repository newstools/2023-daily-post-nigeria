Southampton manager, Ruben Selles has backed Paul Onuachu to deliver the goods for the Premier League club. Onuachu linked up with the Saints from Belgian Pro League outfit, KRC Genk in January. The 28-year-old scored 16 goals in 19 league appearances for Genk before switching over to the South Coast club. The striker has, however, failed to find the back of the net in each of his four Premier League outings. Selles insisted that the Nigeria international will soon open his goal account for the club. “Paul Onuachu who is new in the Premier League and as soon as he arrived, we threw him into the starting XI against Wolves and Chelsea,” Selles told a press conference. “I think he will find his game, hopefully, he’ll find it sooner. We need to give him the tools.” Southampton will host Leicester City at the St Mary’s Stadium on Saturday (today).
