A coalition of accreditation observers groups for the 2023 general elections in Yobe State has tasked the Independent Electoral Commission, INEC, to, as a matter of urgency, retrain its ad-hoc staff on the effective use of Bimodal Verification Accreditation System, BVAS, for the upcoming elections in the state. The Team Secretary, Observers’ Group, Adam Baba Kowa, gave the charge on Tuesday in Damaturu while briefing journalists on their recommendations on the just concluded presidential and National Assembly elections in the state. “There were reports of the late arrival of materials in some places, and some names were not found in the voters’ register, and there were some technical challenges with BVAS machine in capturing voters’ data. “Also INEC ad-hoc staff were not well trained on the use of BVAS machines, and some voters were unable to vote as a result of failure of the machines to accredit them”, he said. The observers, however, noted that there were reports of some discrepancies between the total ballot papers cast and the total number of accredited voters in the BVAS machines in some polling units visited. According to the observers, the peaceful conduct of the presidential and National Assembly elections exercise in the state may not be unconnected to the intensive voter education and the engagement of youth in governance to curb electoral violence in the state. “We commend INEC for the innovation of the BVAS machines in the conduct of 2023 general election. The innovation which has reduced election malpractice,” he said.
