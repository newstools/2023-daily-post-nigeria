Personnel of the Nigerian Navy ship, NNS Delta on Friday invaded the Enerhen Divisional Police Station in Uvwie Local Government Area and beat up a police sergeant simply identified as Kingsley. DAILY POST reports that the incident which occurred at 7:30 am caused serious tension as the area was rocked by sporadic gunshots, forcing owners of commercial shops to quickly shut down while residents taking their children to schools or going to work, fled home. Details as to what led to the alleged invasion were still sketchy at the time of this report, but DAILY POST learnt that a newly commissioned officer attached to the NNS Delta in Warri allegedly led other navy officers to the police station to set free a colleague earlier arrested by policemen. Normalcy has since been restored in the area. NNS Delta, Warri, Base Operations Officer, Navy Commander Samuel Musa, did not respond to calls or text messages sent to his phone. Similarly, policemen at the station kept mum over the incident. Meanwhile, DAILY POST learnt that the navy personnel involved in the alleged invasion of the police station and beating of the police sergeant have been arrested while investigation into the cause of the infraction is in full swing.
