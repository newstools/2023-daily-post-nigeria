Sky Sports pundit, Paul Merson has said Arsenal will win the Premier League following their dramatic comeback win over Bournemouth. The Gunners restored their five-point lead over Manchester City with a 3-2 victory over Bournemouth on Saturday. Mikel Arteta’s men went 2-0 behind, thanks to goals from Phillip Billing and Marco Senesi. But goals from Thomas Partey, Ben White and Reiss Nelson saw Arsenal take maximum points. When asked if he believes Arsenal’s name is on the Premier League trophy, Merson said: “I think they win the league, I really do. “They just keep on going and going; they don’t know when they’re beaten. That’s four wins in a row now. “They came back against Aston Villa too, I think they’ve done brilliantly and if they win their next three games, I don’t see how they don’t win the league.”
