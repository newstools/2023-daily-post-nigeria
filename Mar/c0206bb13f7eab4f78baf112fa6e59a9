A former diplomat, Joe Keshi, has said the lawmakers elected on the platform of the Labour Party, LP, will all dump the party for the bigger political parties in the country. The Labour Party won six senatorial districts and over 30 House of Representatives seats in the National Assembly. While some political analysts believe it is a new dawn for politics in Nigeria, Dr. Keshi said that may not be the case for the new winners. Keshi, a diplomat claimed the politicians could easily be bought over by the already established political parties. “Don’t be surprised that those that won those seats from the Labour Party would be bought over to join the other parties,” he said on Arise TV. “What would have changed the dynamics of Nigerian politics would have been if this election had gone on well and results properly announced and a new leader emerged. But as it is now, I do not agree that the dynamics have changed. “We’ll still continue with what we have in the past. And come four years from now it’s still going to be the same if we don’t get it right based on the judgement of the Court judgement.”
