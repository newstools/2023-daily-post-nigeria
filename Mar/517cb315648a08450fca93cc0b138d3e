Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, has issued orders ahead of the governorship and state houses of assembly elections. Baba directed all Commissioners of Police and Strategic Commanders on duty to mobilize all resources at their disposal to defend the electorates. The IGP also asked them to protect officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, sensitive materials, as well as the electoral process. A statement on Wednesday by Force Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi assured Nigerians of adequate protection on Saturday. Baba ordered strategic deployments at polling units to ward off intimidation, harassment, and assault on law-abiding citizens. All election commanders in states must take up complaints of harassment and assault reported by individuals/groups for proper investigation, the chief further directed. The police added that the Force “is in synergy with other security agencies to ensure security and protection of fundamental rights nationwide”.
