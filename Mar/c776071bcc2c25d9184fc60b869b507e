The Gubernatorial candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, in Ebonyi state, Prophet Chris Adol-awam has debunked the rumour that he had stepped down for the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Francis Nwifuru. Adol-awam made this known in a statement issued to newsmen in Abakaliki through his campaign director on media and publicity, Victor Uraku. Adol-awam noted that the rumoured stepping down for the APC candidate, Nwifuru, was the handiwork of mischief makers who want to deceive his teeming supporters scattered across the 13 LGAs of the state. He berated politicians who were desperate and were doing all things possible to play down on his fast-rising popularity as the leading guber contender in the State. Adol-awam revealed his committed efforts and preparedness to prioritize the welfare of the people of Ebonyi State, especially if elected governor of the state come March 11, 2023.
