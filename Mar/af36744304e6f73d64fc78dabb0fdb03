One of the spokespersons for the Obi-Datti Presidential Campaign Council, Kenneth Okonkwo, has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, of selling votes to the highest bidder. Okonkwo insisted that Nigerians refused to sell their votes and voted their conscience. He disclosed this in a statement via his Twitter handle on Wednesday. The Veteran Nollywood actor questioned why INEC hurriedly announced the results, even as it was yet to fully uploaded results on its IREV portal eleven days after. He wrote, “Nigerians refused to sell their votes and voted their conscience. But the conscienceless INEC sold their votes to the highest bidder. There is nothing wrong with Nigerians. Our problem is dishonest and incompetent leadership. We must not allow this presidential election scam to succeed. “Mahmood INEC must go. Add your voice to this call for a sane society without insane leaders. 11 days after presidential election, INEC IREV Portal and Server have not been fully uploaded, yet Mahmood hurriedly announced his president-elect.”
