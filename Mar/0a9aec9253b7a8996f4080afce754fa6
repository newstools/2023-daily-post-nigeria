Former Nigerian lawmaker, Shehu Sani, has reacted to the peace overtures by President-elect Bola Tinubu to his opponents in the just concluded presidential election. Sani praised the gesture but predicted it would be rebuffed by the presidential candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party and the Labour Party, Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi. He disclosed this on Thursday in a post via his verified Twitter handle. He tweeted: “Asiwaju’s peace overture is good, but I don’t think it will produce any result with the PDP and LP Presidential candidates. The country will certainly be dragged into a long legal battle.”
