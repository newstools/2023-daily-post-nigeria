Chuba Akpom scored twice to help Middlesbrough to a remarkable 5-0 win against Reading at the Riverside Stadium on Saturday. Akpom has scored 21 goals in the Sky Bet Championship this season. The Nigerian-born forward is now the first Boro player to score 20 plus goals in a single season. Bernie Slavens was the last Middlesbrough player to achieve the feat in the 1989/90 season. Akpom also became the first Boro player to score 14 home goals in one season since Fabrizio Ravanelli in 1996-97 season. The 27-year-old opened scoring for his side from the penalty spot on 24 minutes. Akpom then netted Michael Carrick’s side’s third goal of the game three minutes after the break. The goal was the 1000th goal for Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium.
