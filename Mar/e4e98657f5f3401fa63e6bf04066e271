Manchester United legend Gary Neville has heavily criticised defender Luke Shaw, saying that the England international’s performance in their 7-0 thrashing at the hands of Liverpool was a disgrace. Erik ten Hag’s side were helpless during the Premier League clash on Sunday as they were mauled by the Reds who are rejuvenating from a poor run of form. United conceded one goal before the break but the second half opened the floodgates of goals with Liverpool netting six more times in a ruthless and clinical display. Manchester United were shambolic and hapless in defence and Neville felt the usually excellent Shaw was one of the biggest culprits. “Luke Shaw has played the worst game I’ve seen in a long, long time and I think he’s been brilliant this season. The whole back four were a disgrace,” he told The Gary Neville Podcast. “It’s got to be a one-off. That’s got to be something that’s just put down as something that we never see again.”
