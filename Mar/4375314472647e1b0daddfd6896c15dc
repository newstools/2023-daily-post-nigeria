Adams Oshiomhole, the Edo North Senator-elect, has downplayed the possibility of impeaching the state Governor, Godwin Obaseki ahead of the March 11 House of Assembly and governorship elections. Oshiomhole said Obaseki should not worry about being impeached by the incoming lawmakers in the state. Speaking with newsmen in Benin City, the Edo State capital, the Senator-elect said if Obaseki had performed well, he won’t be afraid that the people of the state would vote out his party, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. He noted that Obaseki can only fear impeachment if he had committed some atrocities. According to Oshiomhole: “There is no truth in it unless the governor feels that he has committed so much atrocities that he is now afraid that he cannot stand the rigour of democratic governance. “The purpose of the House of Assembly is to subject the Executive to legislative scrutiny. It is not for nothing that you spend millions, if not billions, maintaining a parliament.” He noted that the House of Assembly candidates contesting to occupy the Edo Parliament are “hungry to ensure that the governor spends resources in a manner that captures the aspirations of their various constituents. Sacking the governor is not in their manifesto.” Oshiomhole accused the Obaseki-led state government of not allowing the parliament to function the way it should.
