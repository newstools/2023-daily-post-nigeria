A woman described as a prominent figure in the Nigerian mafia has been arrested after being on the run since 2010. She was flown from Abuja back to Rome, Italy, where she has been sentenced to 13 years in prison. The crimes of the convict, who was tried in her absence, included running a prostitution ring, Italian police said on Wednesday. 48-year-old Joy Jeff, one of the few women on the country’s most-wanted list, was arrested in Nigeria on June 4, 2022. The international warrant issued before her extradition was facilitated by a treaty signed by Nigeria and Italy in 2020. Investigators in the city of Ancona said Jeff played a major role in trafficking women to Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. The victims narrated how they were forced into prostitution by violence and threats. Video released by the Italian police showed the woman being flown from the Abuja airport to Ciampino airport in Rome. “Africa today is a strategic location when looking for fugitives and fighting organised crime,” said Vittorio Rizzi, an officer responsible for international coordination.
