Famous Nollywood actress, Regina Daniels has highlighted how movie producers take advantage of young girls in the movie industry. Revealing this in a trending video shared via her Instagram page on Tuesday, Regina narrated her encounter on set with a 14-year-old makeup artiste, who had been going from set to set working with different people. Calling out her colleagues who turned a blind eye to the said girl in the past, the actress pleaded with them to stand against child labour. Rescuing the girl from child labour, Regina took her to a boarding school and was surprised to see how well she passed her entrance exam. She added that she has vowed to always fight against any movie producer who recruits young kids for movie roles. Buttressing her point, she also recalled how her mother, actress Rita Daniels, during her early years in the industry, protected her from being sexually abused by movie producers.
