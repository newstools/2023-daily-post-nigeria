The Enugu Electricity Distribution Company PLC, EEDC, has introduced a new service called the Accelerated Settlement of Arrears Project, ASAP. According to a statement on Sunday by EEDC Head of Corporate Communications, Emeka Ezeh, the service is designed to assist customers with outstanding arrears clearing. “The uniqueness of this product is that it offers graded discounts, ranging from 25% (for one-time payment), 20% (for three months payment by instalment), and 35% (for debts of 5 years and above), and appeals to only Non-Maximum Demand (NMD) customers,” the statement outlined. On December 31, 2022, EEDC ended its Arrears One Time Settlement Scheme (OTS), a related initiative targeted at its customers with outstanding arrears. Nigerians daily face multiple challenges that include naira scarcity, energy crisis, poverty, and other difficult economic situations.
