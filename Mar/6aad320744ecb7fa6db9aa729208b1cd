Mr Dumebi Kachikwu, the presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), says the victory of Sen. Bola Tinubu of All Progressives Congress (APC) at the Feb. 25 election was a case of consistency, preparation and opportunity. Kachikwu said this in a statement on Friday in Abuja. He said, “The victory of Tinubu in the recently concluded presidential election is a clear case of consistency and preparation meets opportunity. “Tinubu, a dogged fighter with a mastery of the Nigerian political system, took advantage of a disunited opposition, some of whom were running purely on the divisive platforms of ethnicity and religion. “Tinubu, a dogged fighter with a mastery of the Nigerian political system, took advantage of a disunited among the opposition who were running purely on the divisive platforms of ethnicity and religion. “The distortions occasioned by the rigging done by the four so-called leading parties were not significant enough to have altered the outcome of this election.” Kachikwu also said he had earlier warned that any vote for the Labour Party (LP) was a vote in support of an APC win if the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and LP candidates failed to form an alliance. DAILY POST reports that Tinubu was declared the winner of the Feb. 25 presidential election on Wednesday by the INEC after beating the PDP’s Atiku Abubakar and the LP’s Peter Obi.
