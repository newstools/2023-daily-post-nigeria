Spectacular football game. Outstanding. We played top football against the team in form. “The second half the start was pretty good and the end was pretty good. That is football, it can happen. “It was the push we wanted. It puts us in the right direction. Everyone has to know we are still around. It wasn’t the case for a while but tonight was a proper show of what we can be and what we have to be from now on.” Liverpool have now climbed up to fifth with 42 points from 25 fixtures.
