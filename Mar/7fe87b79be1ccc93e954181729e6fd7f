The Ogun State Police Command has arrested five suspected members of a gang that specialised in exhuming corpses from graves and removing body parts for ritual purposes. Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi on Sunday announced that the suspects, Oshole Fayemi, 60, Oseni Adesanya, 39, Ismaila Seidu, 30, Oseni Oluwasegun, 69 and Lawal Olaiya, 50, were arrested on Saturday in Odogbolu. They were nabbed following a tip-off that led the Divisional Police Officer of Odogbolu Division, Godwin Idehai and his men to their hideout shortly before they embark on another human parts harvest in Ososa town. According to Oyeyemi, the suspects confessed they were in the business of exhuming corpses from graves. “They said that they usually sold the exhumed body parts to their clients who used them for money-making rituals,” said the Police PRO who further disclosed that Commissioner of Police Frank Mba has directed the transfer of the suspects to the State Criminal Investigation Department for further investigation and prosecution.
