Atiku Abubakar, the Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and his running mate, Ifeanyi Okowa, are currently leading a protest to the national headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, in Abuja. DAILY POST reports that the Chairman of the PDP, Sen. Iyorchia Ayu, and other leaders and supporters of the party gathered at the Legacy House, Maitama, to start their protest march to the INEC National Headquarters. This is coming less than a few days after INEC announced the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, as President-elect. Tinubu had defeated Atiku and Labour Party’s Peter Obi during the Feb. 25 Presidential election. The former Lagos State Governor has since received his Certificate of Return from INEC. VIdeo: HE Atiku Abubakar leading a protest to INEC over election fraud! This is the energy I want to see from my President till our dream becomes reality! #AtikuIsComing
