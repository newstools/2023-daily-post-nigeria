Arsenal legend Olivier Giroud has sent a surprise message to youth product Folarin Balogun. This follows the Arsenal striker’s impressive season on loan at French Ligue1 side Reims. Balogun played 10 games for the Gunners’ first team before he was allowed to join the Ligue 1 side on loan last summer. The 21-year-old has scored 15 goals in the French top flight this season, which is only four fewer than Kylian Mbappe. In his video message to Balogun, which was shown on Canal+, Giroud said: “Yo, what’s up, baby Gunner? I hope you are good. “I am glad to see you banging goals in Ligue 1 in France. I am very happy for you, and you deserve to be there. “Carry on like that. Keep it up. Wish you all the best, bro. Take care.”
