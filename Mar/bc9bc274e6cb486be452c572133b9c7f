Nasarawa West senatorial candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) in the February 25 Presidential and National Assembly elections, Wakili Kabiru-Muhammad, has dragged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to the election tribunal over the omission of his party’s logo. Speaking to newsmen immediately after filing his petition on Saturday in Lafia, Kabiru-Muhammad insisted that the logo of the NNPP was not clearly captured on the ballot papers by INEC. NAN reports that INEC and the winner of the election, Ahmed Aliyu-Wadada of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), are the first and second defendants in the case, respectively. Kabiru-Muhammad alleged that the act of omission by INEC didn’t comply with the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2022 and the 1999 Constitution. He, however, called on the tribunal to nullify the election. Kabiru-Muhammad said said he approached the tribunal to seek redress because there were a lot of abnormalities during the election. The petitioner advised his supporters to remain calm and law-abiding and await the outcome of the judgment of the tribunal. Recall that Aliyu-Wadada of SDP scored 96,488 votes as against the candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Shehu Tukur, who polled 47,717 votes.
