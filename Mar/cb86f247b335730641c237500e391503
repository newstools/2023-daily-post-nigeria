Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has claimed that former Anambra State Governor, Mr Peter Obi dumped the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, for the Labour Party, LP, because of moves by some politicians in the PDP to make sure power remained in the north. Wike stated this when he hosted, on a courtesy visit, the National Executive Committee of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide at the Government House, Port Harcourt, on Thursday. The governor said he was a major proponent of a Southern president, insisting that Obi decided to leave the PDP when former Governor of Jigawa State, Sule Lamido, told him (Obi) that power would continue in the north this year. He said: “I supported that power must come to the south. When [Peter] Obi came here, I gave him all the logistics, vehicles, and other support and paid for the stadium, but some other persons applied and I refused. You should know me too well by now. “Obi was running with us. I knew when Obi left. He was principled and he said he couldn’t stand it, people should say the truth. “He went to see Sule Lamido in Jigawa, not in Dutse, but in a village that will take you more than four or five hours drive from Dutse, the capital. “You know what he told Obi? He did not tell him that look, you came late and I have chosen somebody. He said it is the north that would produce the next president. That was how Obi left [the PDP] saying why is he wasting time. Ask him. That is how he left PDP.”
