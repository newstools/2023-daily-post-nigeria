The All Progressives Congress (APC) has mocked Atiku Abubakar, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, for leading a protest on Monday. DAILY POST had reported that Atiku on Monday in Abuja led a protest to the national headquarters of the INEC. Reacting, the APC advised Atiku to get his lawyers to plead his case in court rather than leading a street protest in Abuja. Bayo Onanuga, Director Media and Publicity, APC Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) said, when Atiku told the whole world last Thursday that he would seek redress in court over the outcome of the 25 February Presidential election, little did the ruling party know that he did not plan to be guided by his own promise. He said the ruling party did not think Atiku to be so jobless as to have time to disturb public peace over an electoral outcome he had already said he would challenge in court. Onanuga added that going by Atiku’s political antecedents, it was rather not surprising that, days later, he led a band of protesters, “nay jesters” in Abuja, to the headquarters of Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC). He noted that the protest staged by the leaders of ‘fragmented’ PDP and its presidential candidate would not provide a window of victory for the main opposition party. Onanuga stressed that instead of Atiku and his party to wisely spend their time to gather the so-called evidence they hope to present before the courts, they are busy dancing ‘skelewu’ on the streets and causing traffic nuisance to residents of Abuja. Onanuga wondered how a protest by a scanty crowd will provide any victory window for Atiku and the PDP. According to him, the only recourse open to Atiku after the electoral umpire declared Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the President-elect, is the Election Petition Tribunal. “Atiku and his motley crowd was a new low from the perennial election loser,” he added.
