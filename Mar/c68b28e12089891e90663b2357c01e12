The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, on Thursday denied report that the transfer of former Director of ICT is one of the reasons there were glitches during the uploading of the Feb. 25 national election results. Rotimi Oyekanmi, INEC’s Chief Press Secretary, said such report is an attempt to mislead the public. According to him, there could still be glitches even if the former ICT Director was still in charge. “First, the IReV and Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) are two separate entities, and they are independent of each other. “The relationship between the two is that the BVAS is used to transmit the picture of Form EC8A, which is the Polling Unit Result Sheet in PDF format, as well as the Voters’ Accreditation Data to the IREV,” he said. He explained that the glitches suffered by the IReV for some hours during the Feb 25th election could not have affected the functionality of the BVAS, adding that the BVAS can transmit the Polling Unit results in offline mode if there was no network at the polling unit at the time of the activity. Oyekanmi added that the former ICT Director is indeed a respected, brilliant employee who played his role satisfactorily and INEC has other staff members who could effectively play his former role.
