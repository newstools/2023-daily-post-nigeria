The New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, has given reasons why its presidential candidate, Rabiu Kwankwaso, did not congratulate the president-elect, Bola Tinubu. NNPP said Kwankwaso didn’t congratulate Tinubu because the presidential election was flawed. A statement by NNPP’s National Publicity Secretary, Agbo Major, said reports circulating that Kwankwaso congratulated Tinubu was a figment of the fertile imagination of anti-democrats, political hirelings and fifth columnists. Major said the party rejected the outcome of the election because it did not reflect the wish and mandate of Nigerians who trooped out to vote. According to Major: “The New Nigeria Peoples Party presidential candidate, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, did not congratulate the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Bola Tinubu on the grossly flawed, contentious and disputed presidential election. “NNPP rejects the outcome of the February 25, 2023, presidential election as it did not reflect the will, wish and mandate of the Nigerians who trooped out to vote but were disappointed by the failure of INEC to conduct a credible and transparent election and fulfil its promise to upload the polling units results to its portals which would have guaranteed the authenticity of the results and declaration of the winner of the presidential election.” He added: “It is unthinkable that Kwankwaso would hastily congratulate Asiwaju Tinubu on his questionable mandate which other candidates also claimed they won and had approached the court to seek redress.”
