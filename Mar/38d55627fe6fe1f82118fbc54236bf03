A journalist, Mohammed Usamat Suleman, was attacked by hoodlums in Jalingo, the Taraba State capital, around 8pm on Wednesday. He told DAILY POST that he was on his way home when the hoodlums attacked him in a commercial tricycle he boarded. The Shimo FM staff is receiving treatment in the emergency ward of the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Jalingo. He said the hoodlums, who brandished weapons like guns and cutlasses, demanded he produced a particular midget. “On discovering that I am not in possession of the midget, they beat me to a stupor and pushed me out of the moving tricycle thinking I was dead,” he said. Suleman, who could not fathom why he was targeted by hoodlums, stressed the need for the management of the station, to improve on the security architecture of the station. “What surprised me most is their failure to take away my handset because all they kept demanding was a particular midget but thank God I was not carrying any midget as at the time I was attacked,” he added. When reached for confirmation, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) said the command has not been briefed on the matter but promised to reach out to the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of the GRA police station.
