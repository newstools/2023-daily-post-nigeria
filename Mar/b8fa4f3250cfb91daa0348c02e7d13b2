There are speculations that the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has postponed the governorship and State Assembly elections. The exercise scheduled for Saturday March 11 was reportedly moved by one week – Saturday March 18. National Commissioner for Information, Festus Okoye did not take calls by DAILY POST as at 10:00pm Wednesday. The electoral umpire is being roundly accused of inadequate preparedness for the 2023 general elections. Earlier today, the Court of Appeal granted the prayer by INEC to reconfigure the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System, BVAS, ahead of the state polls. A source within the Labour Party, LP, said there’s no cause for alarm over the rejection of Peter Obi’s appeal against INEC’s request. “We have been granted access to inspect BVAS. The contents are backed up, so there’s no problem for now,” the insider told DAILY POST.
