Manchester United manager, Erik ten Hag has said there are ‘no plans’ to strip midfielder Bruno Fernandes of the armband after calls for the Portugal international to have the captaincy removed following his performance against Liverpool on Sunday. Fernandes has had the armband for most of the season with Harry Maguire’s continued absence from the Man United squad. But Fernandes performed very little of the leadership skills against Liverpool over the weekend. The 28-year-old pushed the assistant referee, held his face after being caught in the chest by Liverpool defender Ibrahima Konate and gestured to come off the field after Jurgen Klopp’s side scored their sixth. Manchester United legend Gary Neville, labelled Fernandes’ actions a ‘disgrace’ after the match. There have been calls for Fernandes to therefore have the captaincy removed. But according to the Sun, Ten Hag has no plans to take the armband off Fernandes and the player still retains his faith.
