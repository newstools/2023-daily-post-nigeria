Chelsea boss, Graham Potter, has said that Joao Felix’s goal that was disallowed against Leicester City by the referee was a fantastic move, apart from the last bit that was offside. Felix scored an offside goal during Chelsea’s Premier League 3-1 win against Leicester City on Saturday. Goals from Ben Chilwell, Kai Havertz and Mateo Kovacic gave Chelsea the victory against Leicester City at the King Power Stadium. The victory over Leicester means Chelsea still maintained the tenth position on the Premier League table with 37 points after 26 games. Speaking at his post-match press conference after the match, Potter said on Felix’s goal, “Joao’s goal that was disallowed was a fantastic move apart from the last bit that was offside. He added, “The players have the quality, but it is on us to improve as a team and if we do that, then I think we will keep scoring goals.”
