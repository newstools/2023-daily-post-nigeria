The governorship candidate of the Niger State People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in 2015 and 2019 elections, Alh. Umar Mohammed Nasko has dumped the party for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). This is coming on the heels of the lost of his presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. Announcing his defection from the PDP in Minna on Thursday, the state capital, Nasko said he accepted to join the APC having been approached by its governorship candidate, Hon Umar Mohammed Bago and based on conviction of the victory of the party in the last elections. Nasko declared that joining the party will mark a turning point for the APC in Niger State, while assuring that he will work hard to ensure the victory of the APC in the forthcoming governorship and state assembly elections in the state. The former strong PDP stalwart, however, called on all his supporters and admirers across the state to join the APC and work assiduously to ensure its success come March 19, 2023 in the state. Accepting the decampee, the Niger State APC governorship candidate, Umar Mohammed Bago said they both shared same vision for the development of Niger State, noting that Nasko will be part of his government if elected. According to him, “Nasko is a courageous and determined young man. He is very intelligent with wealth of experience who has the capacity to be part of the team to move Niger state forward”.
