Delta Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa has stated that the Muslim-Muslim presidency is not God’s will for Nigeria. The governor also expressed his fears about the closure of the church within the Presidential Villa in Abuja. He spoke on Friday at a meeting with Isoko Church Leaders held at God’s Fountain of Life Mission in Oleh, Isoko South LGA. President-elect Bola Tinubu and Vice President-elect Kashima Shettima of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, are Muslims. On last Saturday’s presidential and national assembly poll, the governor said it was compromised, NAN reports. The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, vice presidential candidate noted that the outcome of the election “is not the will of God”. Okowa said the opposition “saw the manipulation coming…and prayed against the situation in which we have found ourselves”. “It is not the will of God that the Chapel in Aso Rock will be closed for four years as a result of the Muslim-Muslim ticket of the APC.” Okowa encouraged Christians to “continue to pray” so that God’s purpose “will be done in our state and in Nigeria” The Delta helmsman added that it is time to “rise in faith and not time to mourn”, urging the faithful to “be prayerful and to think from inside”.
