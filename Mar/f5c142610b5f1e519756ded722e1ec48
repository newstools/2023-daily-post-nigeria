A former aide to ex-president Goodluck Jonathan and social media influencer Reno Omokri said the ‘Obidient Movement’ is not rational.
He disclosed this on Sunday on his official Twitter page. Omokri, a known supporter of Atiku Abubakar, the People Democratic Party presidential candidate in the 25 February election, explained that although Obidient Movement is powerful, it is not national. “If Nigeria must survive and thrive, we need national movements. The Obidient Movement is a powerful force. But it is not a national movement. It is not even rational. That is why when you disagree with an Obidient, insults are to be expected”, he posted. ‘Obidient Movement’ is a group of supporters of Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party. The Movement has aided the popularity of the Labour Party and its electoral successes in the last election, especially in defeating the winner of the presidential election, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in his state. Peter Obi and Atiku Abubakar are currently challenging Tinubu’s victory at the Presidential Election Tribunal.
