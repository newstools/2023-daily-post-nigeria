The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State has raised alarm over alleged plans of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) to rig the governorship and state assembly elections in the state. The party urged the security agencies in the state to muscle out all means and intelligence to deal ruthlessly with anyone or group trying to cause confusion during the forthcoming governorship and state assembly elections. In a statement issued by the party’s publicity secretary, Mallam Yusuf Idris Gusau said the police has already arrested a PDP cards printing agent for all political parties ahead of the March 18 governorship and State Assembly elections in the state. “It is high time that the security operatives in Zamfara State muscle out all means and intelligence to fish out any saboteur or groups trying to cause confusion before, during and even after the upcoming governorship and state assembly elections in the state” “This call has become necessary following Friday’s arrest by the police of one Naziru Ibrahim aka Naziru Abuja who was caught red-handed printing agent cards for all political parties ahead of the March 18 elections” According to Gusau, the All Progressives Congress (APC) has been credibly informed that following his arrest, the said Naziru confessed that he was working for the PDP. “In his Gusau residence during the arrest, the suspect was found to have installed machines that would be used in printing different INEC cleared documents such as the agent cards to confuse the agents officially deployed by the respective political parties from the fake and possibly in the fracas that may ensue, the PDP can hatch its plans to disrupt the elections process” “Recall that even before the last presidential and national assembly elections we raised an alarm of some printers working for the PDP and located at the canteen area of Gusau metropolis” “Similarly, we alerted the security operatives and members of the public of indiscriminate use of fake documents especially in the replacement of result sheets during the presidential/national assembly elections, this arrest goes to vindicate the APC alerts and claims especially that the suspect said he was working directly with and under the supervision of a PDP stalwart in the state, Lubuna Baba Gusau” “At the moment, the PDP is singing the slogan ‘kowa agent, meaning “everyone is an agent” in the coming election, they are already printing agent cards, who knows what they are perpetrating at the rural areas” “We wish to call in strong terms, the security agencies in the state to mop up all those involved in this scam, investigate and dislodge anyone involved in such and expose them before next Saturday’s governorship/State Assembly elections to ensure a peaceful, credible and acceptable election throughout the state”
