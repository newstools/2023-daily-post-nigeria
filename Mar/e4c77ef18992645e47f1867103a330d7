Sunshine Stars head coach, Edith Agoye, has lauded the Interim Management Committee (IMC) for their effort in repositioning the Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL). The IMC was established after the old League Management Committee (LMC) was abolished by the sports ministry. The new body has made efforts to rebrand and reposition the league. Agoye, whose side have enjoyed a good run this season, praised the IMC for the innovations they introduced under the current campaign. “It is very clear for everybody to see that there are big improvements under the Interim Management Committee,” Agoye was quoted by Oyo Sports News. “From the organisation, officiating, and the payment of indemnities to the referees, they have done well.” The NPFL will resume for the second stanza on March 25.
