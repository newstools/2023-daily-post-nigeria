Famous Nigerian content creator and activist, Adebowale Debo Adedayo, better known as Mr Macaroni, has advised Nigerian youths not to engage in tribal war. This is coming hours after the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Idowu Owohunwa, hosted Macaroni and rapper Folarin Falana, known as Falz and other critical stakeholders on Wednesday in a meeting to address security concerns within the state ahead of the forthcoming governorship election. The comedian, in a video shared on his Instagram page on Thursday, urged youths to be united and not trigger intertribal chaos over politicians who will always remain as friends. “I know how some of you must feel, I know we are not happy with the way INEC conducted the elections in certain areas. But the president-elect has been declared, and any aggrieved candidate can go to court but don’t let anybody use you. The youths must remain as one. “Don’t die for any politician, don’t let any politician use you as a tool. They are friends, and the youth can have their choice, but politicians will be politicians. Anyone telling you as a Yoruba man to attack your Igbo brother or my Igbo brothers is telling you to attack Hausas, Yorubas or any other tribe somewhere, my brother, please don’t,” he said. Recall that the comedian had in November 2022, via his Twitter handle, announced his support for the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi, ahead of the 2023 presidential election.
