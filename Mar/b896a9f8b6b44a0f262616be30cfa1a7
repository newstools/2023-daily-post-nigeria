The Alawe of Ilawe Ekiti, Oba Adebanji Ajibade-Alabi, has urged the President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, not to forget his promise of supporting the development of Ekiti economically. Oba Ajibade-Alabi, who made the call at his palace in Ilawe Ekiti, expressed his belief that the former Lagos State Governor would not disappoint Nigerians and, indeed, Ekiti people who voted massively for him. He said that the President-elect had been tested and trusted, urging him to keep his promise of considering the state in the scheme of things. The monarch also urged other contestants in the just concluded election to accept the outcome of the result in good faith, saying that unnecessary distraction would slow down the development of the Nation. The Alawe explained that the All Progressives Congress, APC, lost in some of its strongholds like Lagos, Katsina, Kano and Kaduna, among others, was a pointer to the fact that the election was free, fair and credible. On the cashless policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Oba Ajibade-Alabi charged the Federal Government to obey the Supreme Court judgement by immediately releasing money to banks so that people could have access to cash rather than allowing them to suffer. He suggested that the old and new Naira notes should be quickly made available to bring an end to the hardship in the country. The immediate past Chairman of the Council of Traditional Rulers in Ekiti State also commended Governor Biodun Oyebanji for doing well since his assumption of office. He said that the governor had justified the love and support given to him during his election, urging him to keep up the tempo and, as well, establish a good working relationship with the incoming Tinubu administration in the interest of Ekitiâ€™s development.
