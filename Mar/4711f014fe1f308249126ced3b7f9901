The Interim Management Committee (IMC) has granted Kwara United approval to use the Akure Township Stadium as their home ground for the second stanza of the new season. The Ilorin club were forced to look for an alternative venue at the start of the season due to renovation works going on at their home ground, Kwara Sports Complex. Kwara United adopted the Lekan Salami Stadium, Adamasingba, Ibadan as their home ground for the first half of the campaign. The Harmony Boys recorded just one win from four outings in Ibadan. They defeated Akwa United 2-1, lost 1-0 to Bendel Insurance, and drew the two others against Gombe United and Remo Stars. Kwara United will host El-Kanemi Warriors in their first game at their new home ground on March 25.
