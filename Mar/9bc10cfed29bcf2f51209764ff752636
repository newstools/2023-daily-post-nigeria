Gbemi Saraki, Minister of State for Mines in the Buhari administration, has denied dumping the All Progressives Congress, APC. The former Kwara Senator said the claim of her defection to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, was fake news. Gbemi’s brother, Bukola Saraki, a former Kwara governor and Senate President, returned to the PDP months before the 2019 general elections. A statement by the minister’s spokesperson, Moses Bello, denied she’s now in the opposition to support PDP governorship candidate, Shuaibu Yaman. Saraki recalled working tirelessly to ensure the President-elect Bola Tinubu won the presidential election in the state. She said this was despite disagreements with the actions of the APC-led state government as regards the late Olusola Saraki’s legacies. “If anything, I am even more committed to ensuring the success of the incoming Asiwaju/Shettima administration come May 29,” the minister noted. Bello added that Gbemi Saraki remains a grassroots mobiliser with continued allegiance to President Buhari’s administration and the incoming government.
