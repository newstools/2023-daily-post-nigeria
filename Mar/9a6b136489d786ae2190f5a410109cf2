Manchester United legend, Gary Neville has revealed what Casemiro ordered Bruno Fernandes to do during their Wednesday’s FA Cup win over West Ham. The Red Devils came from a goal down to beat West Ham United 3-1 in the fifth-round of the cup competition booking a date with Fulham in the next stage. Neville pointed out that the Brazil international who joined the Red Devils from Real Madrid in August 2022 ordered Fernandes to play a free-kick in a particular direction during the game. Neville told Sky Sports: “There was a free-kick on the left-hand side that Bruno Fernandes had at one point. “Casemiro went and told him… he pointed at the spot, he said ‘put it there and I’m going to head it’ – Bruno put it there and he actually went and headed it! “He just looks at this moment in time that he is in complete control of that team. He looks like such a dominant force.”
