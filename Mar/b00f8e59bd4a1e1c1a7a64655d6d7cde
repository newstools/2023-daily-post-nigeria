The Speaker of Oyo State House of Assembly, Hon Adebo Ogundoyin has declared that the people of Ibarapa geo-political zone do not want the All Progressives Congress (APC) to return to power in the state. Ogundoyin, who currently represents Ibarapa East state constituency, made this disclosure on Saturday. There are three (3) local government areas that make up the Ibarapa geo-political zone in Oyo state. Ogundoyin declared that the people are already tired of the APC government. The speaker who is seeking a re-election on the platform of the PDP, said that the people of the zone do not want the APC to return to power again. The speaker, while reacting to some videos which surfaced online a few days ago, described the videos as those sponsored by opposition elements who are already jittery of imminent defeat at the forthcoming gubernatorial and House of Assembly elections. Ogundoyin in the statement made available to DAILY POST on Saturday, added that election should not be seen as a do or die affair. Ogundoyin said, “Our people are tired of the APC Government in Oyo State and they don’t want them to return to power. The four years of Governor Seyi Makinde are not only beneficial to the people but also peaceful. “What do they mean by neglect or abandonment of Ibarapaland when the present administration in Oyo State has projects which cut across our zone. We have Igboora/Idere/Ayete/Tapa to Igangan road project and from Igangan to Iganna. These projects cut across the entire Ibarapaland. “In Ibarapa East alone, we have four road projects approved by Governor Seyi Makinde’s administration. Talk of Ogundoyin road, Local Government Secretariat road, New Eruwa to Maya road project and the Ido/Eruwa road recently flagged-off by his Excellency. “I know the opposition are already counting their losses even before the election. Because as a lawmaker, I have delivered on my campaign promises”.
