A Bauchi-based group, Coalition of United Civil Society Organizations, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to caution the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, former Air Marshal Saddique Abubakar against alleged use of violence in places of campaign. Yunusa Ndargomi made the call in a news conference in Bauchi on Saturday. According to the group, Abubakar campaign train had been nothing but a calamity to the good and peace-loving people of Bauchi State as cases of violence and alleged murder had been recorded in some places of his campaign. “His campaign is characterized by show of force and violent intimidation on innocent citizens who in one way or the other showed disapproving gestures against his aspirations,” he said. DAILY POST has gathered that the security attached to him allegedly shot and killed two innocent persons in Akuyam district of Misau LGA while on a campaign tour. “Same scenario happened in Gumau town of Toro LGA where thugs and security attached to him fired live ammunition to disperse crowds as they shouted the slogan “Bamayi” and injuring scores in the process,” he added. It also alleged that the APC governorship candidate had never shown empathy and had neither visited the families of the victims, nor sympathized with their families or their communities.
