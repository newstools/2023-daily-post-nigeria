The Police on Monday arraigned a 32-year-old property agent, Kabir Yamusa, before a Kado Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, for allegedly defrauding his client of N400,000 house rent. The Police charged Yamusa, of no fixed address, for criminal breach of trust and cheating. The prosecution counsel, Stanley Nwafoaku, told the court that on March 3 at about 3:47 pm, the complainant, Dajuma Lawal of Wuse market, Abuja, reported the matter at divisional police headquarters Wuse Zone 3, Abuja. Nwafoaku alleged that sometime in January, the complainant contacted the defendant, a property agent, to secure a one-room apartment for him at Jabi. He alleged that the complainant paid N400,000 into the defendantâ€™s account, and immediately after Yamusa received the money, he absconded without providing the house as promised. The prosecution counsel told the court that the defendant was arrested, and during police investigation, he confessed to having converted the money for his personal use. He said the offence contravened sections 312 and 322 of the penal code. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The Presiding Judge, Muhammed Wakili, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N200,000 with one surety in like sum. Wakili ordered that the surety must be reliable, with a means of livelihood and must reside within the jurisdiction of the court. He added that the surety must also provide a Bank Verification Number, BVN, printout, recent passport photograph and a valid identification card, which must be verified by the court registrar. The Judge adjourned the matter until April 26 for hearing.
