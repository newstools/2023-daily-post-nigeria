The gubernatorial candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, in Ogun State, Olufemi Ajadi Oguntoyinbo, has enjoined the people of the state to disregard the rumour of his withdrawal from the March 11 election in the state. The NNPP candidate, while insisting that he is not stepping down for anyone, described the rumour of his withdrawal from the race as fake. He described the rumour of his withdrawal as untrue and cheap blackmail by opposition parties to discredit his growing popularity. He added that he and his party will not at any time step down for any political party in the forthcoming gubernatorial election in the state. The NNPP candidate made these disclosures in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Saturday. He described the sponsors of the rumour of his withdrawal as political desperados. While speaking further, he maintained that his party remained the only party with the interest of the masses. “I want to assure good people of Ogun state that I am not in any negotiation with any political party or candidate, I am still much in the race and victory is ours. “I want to use this avenue to appreciate those that believe in my ability and capacity to move the forward. “Those that stand by me, those that stand behind me and those that feel concern about the handiwork of political jobbers,” he said.
