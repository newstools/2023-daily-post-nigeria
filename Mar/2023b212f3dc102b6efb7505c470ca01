Napoli forward, Victor Osimhen has revealed the team’s ambition for the remaining part of the season. The Naples club are closing in on their first Scudetto in 30 years having established an 18-point lead at the top of the log. It will take something extraordinary for Luciano Spalletti’s side to lose the title with three months remaining before the end of the campaign. The Luciano Spalletti side are also looking to win the UEFA Champions League for the first time. The Parthenopeans are on course for a place in the quarter-finals after defeating Eintracht Frankfurt 2-0 in the first leg of their Round of 16 tie last week. Osimhen hinted that he and his teammates want to win everything. “March has only begun, so there is still time. But I do want everything, and so do we. For this accomplishment, we give our lives,” Osimhen told Tutto Napoli. “We are giving everything up to get it, thus we deserve it. We are nearly there, but if we get sidetracked now, woe betide us.”
