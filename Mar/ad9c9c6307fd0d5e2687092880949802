Peter, the other half of the popular music band, P-Square, has lamented the tribal crisis brewing up in Lagos State over the general elections. The music artist wants the people to understand that they are being used by politicians who do not care about them but are bent on planting hatred among the different tribes that co-exist in the city of Lagos. Peter, popularly known by his stage name, Mr. P, made the call on Wednesday following the fire outbreak at Akere Spare Parts Market in Olodi-Apapa, Ajegunle, Lagos. Yet-to-be-identified persons were said to have set ablaze the market dominated by Igbos, with property worth millions of Naira destroyed over political reasons. And in a tweet on Wednesday, Mr. P made it clear that the two dominant tribes in Lagos State, the Igbo and the Yoruba, do not hate each other, saying that Nigerians must realise that politicians do not want the best for them no matter what tribe they belong to. “I am an lgbo man married to a Yoruba woman! Igbos do not hate Yorubas. Neither do Yorubas hate Igbos. Politicians are using tribes as an excuse to cover their evil. “They don’t like you whether Igbo or Yoruba. They only care about their pockets. Be wiser,” he tweeted.
