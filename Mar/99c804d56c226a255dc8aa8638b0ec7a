Arsenal legend Ian Wright has blamed Kelechi Iheanacho for Leicester City’s defeat to Southampton on Saturday. The Foxes went down to a 1-0 defeat against the Saints at the St Mary’s Stadium. Iheanacho fluffed two clear-cut opportunities for Leicester City in the game. While manager Brendan Rodgers praised Iheanacho for his display in the game, Wright claimed he was wasteful and should have done more. “You can’t miss the chances I saw today. This header (from Iheanacho), I don’t know what to say. It’s such a poor header. The next one (Iheanacho), just head it back where it came from,” Wright was quoted by the Leicester Mercury. The 26-year-old has scored three goals in 16 league appearances for the former Premier League champions this season.
