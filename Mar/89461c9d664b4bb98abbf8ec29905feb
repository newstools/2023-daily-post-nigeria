A supercomputer of Bettingexpert has predicted the final Premier League table, teams to qualify for the Champions League and relegated after Manchester United dropped two points following a 0-0 draw with Southampton over the weekend. Manchester United’s goalless draw with Southampton meant they failed to bounce back in the Premier League following their 7-0 embarrassing defeat to Liverpool. And Tottenham moved within two points of Man United, thanks to a 3-1 win over Nottingham Forest. Newcastle also capitalised on the Red Devils’ stalemate with a 2-1 win over Wolves, but Brighton, Fulham and Brentford all dropped points. However, according to Bettingexpert’s latest supercomputer prediction, Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Newcastle United will finish in the top four positions, qualifying for next season’s Champions League. Tottenham Hotspur will finish in the fifth position, Brighton in sixth, Liverpool in seventh, Brentford in eighth, Chelsea in ninth and Fulham will occupy the tenth position. The likes of Bournemouth, Everton and Southampton will be relegated and finish in the 18th, 19th and 20th positions.
