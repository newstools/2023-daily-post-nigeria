The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has announced a new framework agreed upon with the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) to improve the quality of service, accuracy, and speed of passport services in the country. This, according to the agency, would be done through the timely verification of the National Identification Number (NIN). A statement signed and made available to DAILY POST on Monday by Kayode Adegoke, NIMC’s Head, Corporate Communications said that this new arrangement is geared towards streamlining passport application, renewal, and issuance processes as directed by the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy. Applicants, according to the new arrangement, would be charged for each Nigerian passport. “The applicable NIN verification fee is N1000 for Nigeria, for African countries it is $5.00 (or its equivalent in other currencies) while other countries will pay $15.00 (or its equivalent in other countries),” the statement said. “The NIN service, fees, and the new NIS process will go live on 1st April 2023.”
