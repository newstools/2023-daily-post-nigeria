Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has declared that he is not going to run for the presidency again. Wike while addressing party supporters during the governorship election campaign rally, said power will shift to the North after eight years in the South. Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress, APC, was declared the winner of the 2023 presidential election but his closest challengers have gone to court to seek redress. Wike said the reason he fought for power to return to the South was not to become President, insisting that it was not about him but a matter of principle. “It’s not everyone that started a revolution that will benefit from it. I did it. I fought it and it doesn’t matter. Whether I become President or not is immaterial. “What is material is that power has come to the South. It must not be me. It must not be me. It’s a matter of principle. “If it finishes from the South, it goes to the North. I won’t run again. Because the South will finish in eight years and it goes to the North. Because it’s that principle of [power rotation] that brings peace. It’s what brings unity.” Wike had fought against the national body of his party the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP for fielding a northern candidate and ensured the party did not win the presidential election in Rivers State.
