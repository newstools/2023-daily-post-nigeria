The All Progressives Congress, APC, Presidential Campaign Council, PCC, has called on presidential candidates of Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi, and Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to concede defeat to Nigeria’s president-elect. APC PCC Media Adviser, Dele Alake, made the remark while condemning LP and PDP for calling for the cancellation of the presidential election. Recall that PDP and LP held a joint press conference yesterday where they condemned the conduct of Saturday’s election. They called on the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to cancel the election. Reacting, Alake said calling for the cancellation of the election was tantamount to an “abortion of democracy.” Addressing journalists in Abuja, Alake said Atiku and Obi should “accept defeat honorably.” “This election has already been won by our candidate, according to the result declared by the collation centres in the states, In 2015, President Jonathan did not wait for INEC to finish collation before he called President Buhari in the true spirit of democracy and sportsmanship. “We urge Abubakar and Obi to follow the same path of honour instead of heating the polity with reckless statements by surrogates. Let Atiku and Obi do the needful, the necessary thing and save Nigeria by calling Tinubu now and conceding defeat.” Alake said.
