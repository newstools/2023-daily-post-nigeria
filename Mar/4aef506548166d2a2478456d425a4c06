The former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Timi Frank has applauded the Supreme Court over its judgement on Naira Swap Policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria. In a press statement on Sunday which was made available to journalists in Abuja, Frank described the judgement of the apex court which ordered the use of old bank notes till December, 2023 as a sound judgement. The redemption of image by the judiciary, he said, became imperative given the shame that such bizarre judgements have brought to Nigeria which now look like “court judgement is for the highest bidder. Frank said: “Some of the Supreme Court’s rulings in recent time have made Nigerians to lose hope in the judiciary especially the one that awarded senatorial ticket to Godswill Akpabio.” He also queried judgement that affirmed the Senate President, Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan who he said never participated in the Yobe North APC senatorial primary election. Both Lawan and Akpabio were made overnight candidates by the Supreme Court and lamented the more that they were elected senators. Frank, who is the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP) Ambassador to East Africa and Middle East, said Nigerians have lost confidence in the judiciary.
