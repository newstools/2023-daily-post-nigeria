Chelsea co-owner, Todd Boehly, gave a sharp response when asked about their 1-0 win over Leeds in the Premier League on Saturday. The Blues edged past the relegation-threatened side at Stamford Bridge with Wesley Fofana heading in the only goal. Graham Potter’s side only registered three shots on target and failed to fully impress with their display. Boehly, when asked if he enjoyed the match, gave a blunt response to the media. He simply remarked, “it’s a result,” before smiling. The win is the first in eight games and just the second in 12 in all competitions under Potter. Potter has lost as many games as he has won (10) during his 27 games at the club since replacing Thomas Tuchel.
