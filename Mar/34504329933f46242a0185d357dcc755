Former Manchester United striker, Michael Owen, has lavished praises on Arsenal attacker Bukayo Saka after he scored a goal in the Gunners’ Premier League 4-0 win over Everton on Wednesday. Owen described Saka’s display against Everton as absolutely brilliant, adding that he loves how the England international turns with the ball. Recall that Arsenal defeated Everton at Emirates Stadium, thanks to goals from Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Martin Odegaard. “It was a brilliant finish from Saka, absolutely brilliant,” Owen said on Premier League Productions. “At the last minute, he decided to take it on his right, then nobody could get near him. What a finish it was. “I love the way he turns for the opening goal. He uses his body to get between the ball and man, then the finish is exquisite with his right foot.” Arsenal’s next Premier League game is against Bournemouth Saturday.
