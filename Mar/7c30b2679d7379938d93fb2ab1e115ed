Former Newcastle United star, Alan Shearer, has suggested that Arsenal’s opening goal against Fulham could have been cancelled after defender Ben White blocked off Bernd Leno. Arsenal restored their five-point lead in the Premier League table after beating Fulham 3-0 at Craven Cottage on Sunday. Three goals from Gabriel Magalhaes, Gabriel Martinelli and Martin Odegaard gave Mikel Arteta’s side the victory over Fulham, thanks to Leandro Trossard’s assists. But Shearer felt the opener, which saw Trossard whip in a perfect delivery for defender Gabriel to nod home – might have involved a little foul play from White. He said: “It would not have surprised me [if it had been ruled out] because Ben White is actually blocking the goalkeeper,” Shearer told Premier League Productions. “By the time he actually unblocks him, it is too late for the keeper to make a decision whether he is going to come or not. “The ball is already in the air, it is practically in the six-yard box. He might not have come for it, or he may have, but that option was taken away from him because of the blocking there. “It is a good ball in, it is a good header, but he is blocking him right up to the very last second, Ben White, so it would not have surprised me [if it was ruled out]. “Having said that, it would not have changed anything today because Arsenal were much better than them.”
