The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has explained why there were issues with the result viewing portal during this year’s presidential election. The IReV portal was introduced by INEC to improve the transparency of the electoral process. The commission had promised that polling unit results would be uploaded to the IReV portal in real time. The portal, however, remained inactive even after voting had ended in some polling units. Speaking on Channels Television’s ‘Sunday Politics’ on Sunday, the INEC national commissioner, Festus Okoye, sought to explain what happened on February 25. “Yes, we promised that results would be uploaded in real time to our result viewing portal, but there were challenges. “We already explained to Nigerians that these glitches happen; we didn’t anticipate that we’re going to have these challenges. “Whatever challenges we recorded, we have made very serious efforts to rectify them so that during the governorship and state assembly elections, we won’t record the same issues going forward,” Okoye said.
