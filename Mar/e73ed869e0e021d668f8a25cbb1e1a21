The Niger State chapter of the Nigerian Association of Women Journalists, NAWOJ, in a statement jointly signed by its chairperson, Hajiya Rabi Sarki Bello, and secretary, Mrs Rita Durumi, said in line with this year’s theme of the International Women’s Day, the state government should give attention to the development of women, especially in the area of technology and innovations. According to them: “Women in the state have a lot of developmental needs which must be addressed by improving their technological skills. “This can only be achieved if women are given adequate training [and] empowerment as well as platforms to do exploits which cannot be overemphasised. Women are peculiar beings that must be treated with respect, care and all sense of responsibility. “
