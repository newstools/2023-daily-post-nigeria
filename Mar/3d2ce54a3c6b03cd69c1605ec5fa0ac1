A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has berated the governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Godwin Emefiele over hardship imposed on Nigerians following the recent cashless policy, revealing what should be written on his gravestone when he (Emefiele) dies. The apex bank had, through its cashless policy, redesigned N200, N500 and N1000 notes, fading out the old notes since February 10. The unavailability of the newly redesigned notes had caused havoc across the country. The CBN, however, bowed to pressure on Monday and okayed the recirculation of the old notes as recently ordered by the Supreme Court. Reacting to the development, FFK, a former Aviation Minister, said for inflicting pains on common Nigerians via the policy, Emefile’s gravestone should carry the inscription, “Here lies Godwin the fool who thought that he would live forever, who thought that power lay in the hands of mere mortals and who thought that money was greater than God. May he burn in hell forever”. According to the APC chieftain, the party’s stalwarts who fought for the return of the old notes have thrown the CBN governor under the bus. “Godwin has finally been thrown under the bus. He deserves the worst. A psychotic & vicious sociopath, he is undoubtedly the most sadistic soul that has ever been given a position of power in our nation’s history. “His cruelty surpasses all others & his wickedness has no limitations”, he added.
