A former military governor of Ondo State, Bode George has described last Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly election as shambolic. The former chairman of the Nigerian Ports Authority, NPA, said that the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, lifted the hopes of Nigerians with the promise that last Saturday’s polls would be conducted electronically but failed at the last minute. Bode George, the national vice-chairman in the South West zone of the Peoples Democratic Party, described the incoming government of Bola Ahmed Tinubu as darkness, berating the people congratulating the former Lagos State governor. “The Chairman of INEC promised the whole world that we are going to have a new beginning and Mr President himself signed the new electoral bill. They completely encouraged Nigerians that this time around that we’ll be doing like the civilised world that from the polling units, the results would be transmitted to their server. “I was miffed, shocked that at that very hour, on that D-Day, he had the temerity to tell [us] there were hitches in the technology. It’s absolutely shambolic, disgraceful and not accepted. For God’s sake, when will Nigerians have the will to tell the truth? When will Nigeria come out of these nonsensical things? “This is unacceptable for God’s sake. People are talking, hailing and congratulating, congratulating what? That was the way we’ve done elections in the past and it has not helped this country. Now they’re throwing in the same bad eggs to manage the resources of the country.” Lamenting that “we cannot continue in this darkness that doesn’t make any sense,” George said: “People were now manipulating results and that is what you’re hailing? We’re going into darkness and people are clapping? I’m ashamed to be a Nigerian. The Almighty God will not accept it. If you build your house on a faulty foundation it is a matter of time before it collapses. We are definitely not fools.”
