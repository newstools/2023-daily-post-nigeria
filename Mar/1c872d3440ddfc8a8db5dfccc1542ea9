Former Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola has stated that he has no doubt in his mind that he would return to power soon. Oyetola, who stated that his mandate is very much intact and will be reclaimed soon, made this statement while giving a short remark during the 12-year remembrance prayers for his late mother, Alhaja Wulemot Oyetola on Monday at Iragbiji, Osun State. “I am thankful to God for His wonders over our lives. We thank Him for giving us victory for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and I thank our people for their support all along. “We want you to know that APC is the only party that can take us to victory. This is the party that God has made for us. That is where benefits lie. Please, vote APC all through. If we truly want to benefit from the federal government, please, let’s elect our people to the House of Assembly. These are the people that will work with us when we return to government. “We don’t believe in any other thing except prayers. That is what we were brought up with. Let’s continue to pray so that we can thank God in the end,” he said. Oyetola also commended the people of the state for their unflinching support and for coming out enmasse to elect the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu during the presidential election.
