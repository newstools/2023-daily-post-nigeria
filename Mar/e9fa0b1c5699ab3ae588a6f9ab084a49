Three days after the Supreme Court verdict on the old Naira notes’ validity, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Emeka Etiaba, said President Muhammadu Buhari’s directive to the Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, Godwin Emefiele, would end the weeks-long currency crisis. Emeka disclosed this on Monday during a Channels Television interview monitored by DAILY POST. “The Federal Government has been directed by the Supreme Court, by inference its agency, in this case, the Central Bank of Nigeria. “A statement, directive from President Muhammadu Buhari to the Governor of the Central Bank will work magic; it does not need to take one week”, he stated. DAILY POST gathered that the Central Bank of Nigeria had remained mum over the Supreme Court’s verdict validating the use of old N200, N500, and N1000 notes amid uncertainty by business owners, traders and commercial banks.
