Everton manager, Sean Dyche has debunked reports linking Alex Iwobi with a move away from the club. There are reports in the Turkish media that Iwobi is unhappy at Goodison Park and is considering a move away from the club. Turkish Super Lig giants, Fenerbahce are rumoured to be interested in the Nigeria international. But Dyche has refuted the report and claimed Iwobi’s future remains at the club. “Well, I’ve seen him today, and he seems to be quite happy at the moment… it is unlikely, I would suggest,” Dyche told reporters. Iwobi’s contract with the Toffees will expire next summer.
