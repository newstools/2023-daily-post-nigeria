The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Monday declared Idris Salman of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) as the winner of the election for Kabba-Bunu/Ijumu Federal Constituency in Kogi State. The INEC Returning Officer, Dr Adams Baba, announced the results in Kabba. INEC had, on February 26, declared the result of the constituency inconclusive because of the difference between the margin of win and voided results in two polling units. INEC was, however, able to resolve the numbers and declared Salman as the winner of the election with 13, 867 votes to beat the incumbent Speaker of the Kogi House of Assembly, Matthew Kolawole. Kolawale, who contested on the platform of the APC, got 13,605 votes, while Olaiya Olobatoke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) polled 10,967 votes. Baba said: “Idris Salman of ADC, having satisfied the requirements of the law, is hereby declared [the] winner and is returned elected.”
