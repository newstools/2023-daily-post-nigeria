The journalist was returning to Ijebu-Ode from Abeokuta when the kidnappers struck and attacked his Toyota Camry car at about 7:50 pm. The abductors were said to have called his wife on phone the following morning to demand a ransom of N30 million before the husband could be freed. Abimbola Oyeyemi, the police spokesman, confirmed on Monday morning that the Commissioner of Police, Frank Mba, had directed the DPO of Obalende division, SP Murphy Salami, to ensure the safe rescue of the victim. According to Oyeyemi, the team had embarked on a “technical and intelligence-based investigation that led them to Idimu area of Lagos, where the kidnappers were hibernating waiting for the ransom.” Oyeyemi said the hoodlums engaged the operatives in a shootout which lasted for about 45 minutes before they abandoned the car and took to their heels after sustaining varying degrees of gunshot injuries. The kidnappers, DAILY POST learnt, later abandoned the victim and fled with gunshot injuries. He appealed to members of the public, especially hospitals and traditional healers, to inform the police if anybody with a gunshot injury is seen in their area.
