Peter Okoye of P-Square music band has sent out a message to the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi and members of the Obidient movement after their defeat in the 2023 presidential election. Mr. Okoye, in a message he shared via his Twitter handle on Wednesday evening called for calm among supporters, urging them to give room for peace. Obi came third in the election, according to the results read out by the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Mahmood Yakubu on Wednesday morning. Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress, APC polled a total of 8,794,726 to defeat his closest rivals and candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP Atiku Abubakar and Obi who scored 6,984, 520 and 6,101,533 respectively. There are rumours of plans for a massive protest across the country over the results released by INEC, which many electorates believe are different from what happened at the polling units across the country on Saturday. There is also anger over INEC’s failure to use the BVAS and transmit results from the polling units to its portal. “Dear H.E @PeterObi your mandate can only be delayed, but cannot be denied. “Please, my fellow obedient, be calm, we live to fight another day, so please embrace peace. “Let’s all allow the right people of the law to handle the case. Thank you Nigerians.”
