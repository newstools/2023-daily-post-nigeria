Businessmen, transport owners, landlords, artisans and several others have refused to accept old Naira notes in Kaduna. Also, various churches across Kaduna state on Sunday, refused to accept old notes for offerings and tithes. DAILY POST recalls that the Supreme Court had nullified the naira redesign policy by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). It extended the validity of the old naira notes till December 2023. However, residents of Kaduna were disappointed as foodstuff sellers, artisans refused to accept the old notes. According to Alhaji Mustapha Amodu, who sells baby food and other household items, the old notes are no longer acceptable, adding that “if I collect the old notes, banks would reject them.” Also, Mrs. Hannah Abraham, who sells foodstuff in wholesale at Central Market, Kaduna, said she would not accept old notes. “Old notes are no longer acceptable. If there is court judgement, let the president address Nigerians. Court judges are not bank managers that will accept or reject the old notes. They should allow the CBN to speak on the issue. No bank is accepting old notes any longer,” she said. Meanwhile, various churches across the state also refused to accept the old notes as tithes and offerings.
