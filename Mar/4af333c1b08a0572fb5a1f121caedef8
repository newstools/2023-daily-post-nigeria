The Northern Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), has condemned a member of the House of Representatives, Ado Doguwa for allegedly mobilising thugs who killed innocent people in Kano state. The lawmaker was allegedly involved in a violent confrontation between members of the New Nigeria People Party (NNPP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) that led to the killing of three people and the burning of a campaign office of the opposition party in the Tudun Wada Local Government Area of Kano state. Abdullahi Kiyawa, the police spokesperson in the state, explained that the lawmaker was arrested and charged with murder. According to Isah Abubakar, the National President, Northern Youths Council of Nigeria, “We cannot be idle when the right, privileges, freedom and peace of the North is concerned. We must all come out in full force to put a stop to a long time tyranny and rape of democracy demonstrated by the unscrupulous dishonourable Ado Doguwa over the years.” The youths explained that reports have shown how Ado Doguwa illegally mobilised thugs because of a political difference, thereby forcibly imposing himself to be declared winner in an election characterised by vote buying and voters’ intimidation. The statement further explained, “His (Ado Doguwa) arrest has shown the power of the law over any other power, and has also brought an end to the era of fear, intimidation and all kinds of abuses of political power.” The youths prayed that he (Ado Doguwa) be fully prosecuted according to the alleged crime committed. “We shall keep vigilant on the whole prosecution to monitor how the judiciary play their role in sanitising our political system,” the youths explained in the statement.
