Arsenal legend, Thierry Henry, heaped praises on Chelsea’s Champions League match-winner, Kai Havertz. Henry said that Havertz reminds him of former Arsenal striker, Robin van Persie. Havertz scored a penalty in Chelsea’s Champions League round of 16 second-leg 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund. And Henry was impressed with the Germany international’s link-up play for Chelsea against Dortmund. Speaking with CBS Sport, Henry said, “He reminds me sometimes, a little, of Robin back to goal the way he can hold the ball. Robin van Persie was very good with his left foot, the touch was always immaculate, and he tried to bring people along. “This is why out of the guys that used to be wingers or No.10 he plays as a 9 because with his back to goal he can hold the ball well.”
