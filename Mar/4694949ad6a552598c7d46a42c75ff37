The gubernatorial candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) in Abia State, Bishop Sunday Onuoha has reacted to the accusation of bribery and falsehoods levelled against him by the Social Democratic Party (SDP), flagbearer, Apostle Ngozika Gladys Johnson-Ogbuneke. DAILY POST recalls that SDP candidate, Johnson-Ogbuneke had on Wednesday, said she would not step down for any candidate of another political party, warning Onuoha, the Abia Labour Party(LP) gubernatorial candidate, Alex Otti; and that of the Action Peoples Party,(APP), Mascots Uzor-Kalu; to refrain from spreading lies against her and focus on their campaigns. Her words: “If they love Abia State, I challenge them to do like Zaccheus (Luke19:1-13) and return to Abia State treasuries all the looted monies that they have taken out. “Let the people of Abia State see them truly for who they are. Your ugly propaganda cannot work, be stuffed with your dirty ill-gotten wealth. “Ngozi Abia will not step down for no one. Abia State shall be greatly built up indeed in Yeshua’s might name. Amen”. But the Abia ADC gubernatorial flagbearer, Bishop Onuoha, in a statement on Thursday, frowned at the libellous publication credited to Gladys Johnson-Ogbuneke, demanding a retraction within 24hrs. Onuoha partly stated: “I have worked so hard to have a very clean name. And I pray, you make a public statement either to own or disown what is trending right now. “I have forwarded the document to you but you have not made any response up till now. “This is my third time raising my displeasure over a publication credited to you that has damaging content on my person. “I have equality called and your staff picked my phone and promised that you will return my call. “I also have called you and you promised to call back. “At this point, I give you 24hrs to retract your publication against me or else I will take necessary measures that will address my concern in a civilized manner”.
