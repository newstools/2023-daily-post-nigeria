A chieftain of the Labour Party, Bayo Averehi has slammed the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, for allegedly using the Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC), to subvert the will of Nigerians in the just concluded Presidential and National Assembly elections. Averehi, who made his position known while addressing journalists in Lokoja on Sunday, rejected the outcome of the election which produced Senator Ahmed Bola Tinubu as President Muhammamdu Buhari’s successor. Describing the election results as declared by the INEC as a great injustice and a rape of Nigeria’s democracy, the former Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP) Governorship aspirant in Kogi State said the 2023 election recorded the highest number of voters’ turnout in the history of Nigeria. He, however, lamented that the outcome of the 2023 polls has been widely condemned by both local and international observers, thereby, making Nigeria a laughing stock among comity of nations. Averehi said: “this is because the youth and others came out en-mass, having developed confidence in the electoral process due to the provisions of the electoral act, which gave assurance that their votes will count. “They hurriedly declared results without considering the reported election anomalies and the provisions of the constitution which states: ‘and the FCT’. ln the end, we shall prevail, the truth will overcome”.
