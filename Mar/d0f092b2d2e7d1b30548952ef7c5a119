Festus Keyamo, SAN, the spokesperson of the Tinubu/Shettima Presidential Campaign Council of the ruling All Progressives Party, APC, has urged the ruling party’s faithful to be magnanimous in victory and celebrate without insulting their political opponents after Bola Tinubu was declared President-elect. Prof. Mahmoud Yakubu, the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, had earlier on Wednesday declared the APC presidential candidate Tinubu the winner of the 2023 presidential election and President-elect. Before the declaration of the results, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and the Labour Party alleged irregularities in the collation of the results by the INEC. The opposition parties also called for the cancellation of the election results and the resignation of Yakubu. Following the jubilations that followed Tinubu’s victory, Keyamo urged his fellow party supporters not to taunt opponents in their celebrations. Keyamo wrote on Twitter on Wednesday: “As we celebrate, we must do so without taunting our opponents who are great patriots. “After all the vitriols during the campaigns, this is a time to embrace ourselves for nation-building. At the end of the day, we all mean well for our country, though from different perspectives.”
