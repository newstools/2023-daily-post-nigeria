The Premier League is slowly moving towards its business end. This weekend, matches in Game Week 26 will be played in stadiums across England. There are a few things to look out for at both ends of the table. 1. Pope returns: Newcastle will be looking to bounce back from their Carabao Cup final defeat to Manchester United last week when they travel to Manchester City in the early kick-off on Saturday. An added boost for the Magpies will be the return of Nick Pope from suspension. The England goalkeeper has the highest number of clean sheets in the division and could prove key to his team getting a result at The Etihad. 2. Arsenal to consolidate lead: No matter what happens this weekend, Arsenal will remain top of the Premier League for at least one more week. This is because they opened a five-point gap at the top thanks to their 4-0 thrashing of Everton in midweek. If City stumbles against Newcastle, the Gunners could extend the gap when they welcome relegation-threatened Bournemouth. 3. Chelsea to finally win? Graham Potter has failed to win a single match since the club owners splashed out 300m on new players in January. But the visit of an out-of-sorts Leeds could provide Chelsea with a chance to pick up three points. Although the Blues will not move from 10th place this weekend, a victory could provide momentum. 4. Reds or Red Devils? Liverpool vs Manchester United this Sunday would be a very key fixture for both sides this season for different reasons. Jurgen Kloppâ€™s men have found some form in recent weeks and are launching a late bid to finish in Champions League places. But for United, they are looking to make it a three-horse title race along with City and Arsenal.
