The Zamfara State Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Professor Saidu Babura Ahmad, has directed that the sensitive material for governorship and Houses of Assembly election should be kept by security agencies for security reasons. According to him, the commission and stakeholders have taken inventory of the materials the commission had distributed to the 14 local government areas of the State before the announcement of the postponement of the election. Ahmad disclosed this while fielding questions from journalists over the security of sensitive election materials. Recall that the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, in the State had last Wednesday started the distribution of sensitive election materials across the 14 local government areas of the state for the governorship and State Assembly elections scheduled for Saturday, 11th March 2023 but was postponed till March 18. Ahmad confirmed that the sensitive electoral materials arrived safely in the LGAs before the rescheduling news and directed the security agencies to secure them. According to him, the commission held a meeting with the Inter Agencies Consultative Committee on Election Security with all security chiefs and paramilitary heads in the state to review the Presidential and National Assembly elections, and strengthen preparation for the governorship and State Assembly elections, to ensure that the poll is credible and acceptable. He, however, urged the electorates in the State to be calm and come out in large numbers on 18th March, when the governorship and State Assembly elections would be due, to vote for candidates of their choice.
