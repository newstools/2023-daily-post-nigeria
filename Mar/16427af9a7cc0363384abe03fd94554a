Residents of Owo, the headquarters of the Owo Local Government Area of Ondo State, have been thrown into a state of confusion following the death of a 29-year-old nursing mother, Tawa and her five-month-old child. The tragedy was believed to have been caused by the fumes of the generator purchased less than a week ago. The husband of the deceased nursing mother had been in critical condition at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Owo. It was gathered that the couple turned on the generator before going to bed. When she did not report to work the following day with her husband, the deceased’s older sister, who had expected to see her there, started to get worried. An FMC source disclosed that “When Tawa called her older sister on Thursday night to report that her infant was ill, the sister advised her to bring the child. “The deceased’s sister was informed that neither Tawa nor the husband were at work when she arrived at FMC at around 1 o’clock. “Worried, the elder sister went to their house with a few of the deceased’s coworkers. “The door was locked when they arrived, so they had to force entry and were horrified by what they saw. “The baby had already passed out when the door was forced open, the couple were lying unconscious on the bed.” Tawa was put on a ventilator in an effort to revive the couple after being rushed to FMC, however, she later passed away while doctors had been battling to save her husband.
