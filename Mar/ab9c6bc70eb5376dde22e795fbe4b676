Manchester United legend, Gary Neville, has predicted that the Red Devils will finish in the second position on the Premier League table this season. Neville said this while insisting that Man United’s rival, Man City will win the title this season. Providing his predictions on the Overlap, Neville said: “That is my inkling earlier in the season, what normally happens is one team gets so close they realise they can’t win it and then they just go like that in the last two or three games. You lose two games and then all of a sudden, someone else goes above you. “I thought [Manchester] City would win the league and United would finish second two or three months ago. To be fair, I’m not going to change my mind about it. “I still think City are going to win the league even though Arsenal, the closer it gets… but 14 games is still a long way to go. I still think United will finish second.”
