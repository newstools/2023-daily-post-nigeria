President Muhammadu Buhari has given a reason why Nigerians living in Doha, Qatar, should support President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. Buhari said Nigerians in diaspora should support Tinubu’s government so that Nigeria will continue to be the beacon of hope and prosperity in Africa and an example for other African countries to emulate. The President’s media aide, Malam Garba Shehu, in a statement on Wednesday, said the President made the call at a town hall meeting as part of his visit to the State of Qatar on Tuesday. Buhari, therefore, called on them to “support the incoming government of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, so that Nigeria will continue to be the beacon of hope and prosperity in our continent and an example for other African countries to emulate.” DAILY POST reports that Tinubu is expected to take over the reins of government on May 29. The former Lagos State governor was declared the winner of the Feb. 25 presidential election after he defeated the likes of Peoples Democratic Party’s Atiku Abubakar and Labour Party’s Peter Obi.
