The statement said Flutterwave collaborates with other financial institutions and law enforcement agencies to keep the ecosystem safe and secure. “During a routine check of our transaction monitoring system, we identified an unusual trend of transactions on some users’ profiles,” it reads. “Our team launched a review (inline with our standard operating procedure), which revealed some users who had not activated some of our recommended security settings might have been susceptible. “We want to confirm that no user lost any funds, and we take pride in the fact that our security measures were able to address the issue before any harm could be done to our users. “Our commitment to keeping our users’ financial information secure is why we invest heavily in security initiatives such as periodic audits, certifications, and licenses such as the PCI-DSS & ISO 27001. “We want you to continue to trust us and feel secure in using Flutterwave for your business needs.
