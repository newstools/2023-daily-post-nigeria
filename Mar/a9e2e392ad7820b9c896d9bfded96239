Manchester United legend, Peter Schmeichel, has pinpointed the mistake manager Erik ten Hag made during his side’s humiliating Premier League 7-0 defeat to Liverpool on Sunday. Schmeichel believes Ten Hag made a mistake by not substituting Wout Weghorst and Antony at half-time during the encounter at Anfield. He said it was clear Ten Hag’s game plan was not working, with Weghorst struggling in the No 10 role and Antony ineffective against Liverpool. A goal from Roberto Firmino and a brace each from Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah and Darwin Nunez gave Liverpool the victory against Man United. “I was quite alright at half-time because we’ve been behind before, we have had a team talk and Ten Hag has made a few changes and then the second halves have been different,” Schmeichel said on BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast. “I was expecting changes at half-time, I was expecting two changes and he did not do them, which was disappointing. The same team came out, but for me, it was evident it was not working with Weghorst, it was not working with Antony. “I think if you play with Antony, you have to play Wan-Bissaka behind him because he doesn’t take part in defending. Dalot is in for a fair bit of criticism today, which I think is unfair.”
