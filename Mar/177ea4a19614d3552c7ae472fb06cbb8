Former Ekiti State Governor, Peter Ayodele Fayose on Friday denied a viral report about him quitting the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP and insisted that he remained a bonafide party member. Fayose in a statement signed on Friday, stated that he only stepped aside for a purpose but did not resign. “I’m still a bonafide member of the PDP. I only said I stepped aside because I needed to speak the truth to power without fearing my view being tainted by party colouration. Resigning from a political party has a procedure, and the same will be followed if I find the need to leave the party. “It is important that we have someone who can tell the truth without wearing any party toga. “I am a member of the PDP, a member of the party caucus, a member of the PDP NEC and a member of the board of trustees based on my position as the former chairman of the party governors’ forum. It’s a lifetime membership. But Nigeria is bigger than any party. “I’m not an APC member and will never be. I have never hidden my respect for Tinubu. Notwithstanding, I believe the 2023 presidential election is free and fair, and I’m entitled to my views. “I’m not interested in contesting for any political position again. Even if I will contest not under APC. I have repeatedly said that I can never join APC, and I am still saying it now. “Again, may I conclude here that the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi, is the man of the season. Tinubu won the election, but PDP was too fractured to win any election at the federal level. “However, please continue to support and vote PDP at the state level elections are local level, especially in the houses of assembly and governorship elections.”
