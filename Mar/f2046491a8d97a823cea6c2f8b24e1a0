Pastor Johnson Suleman of the Omega Fire Ministry has slammed those attacking him for showing a preference for a particular candidate in the election. Suleiman questioned why it is an issue for a pastor to have a preferred candidate. The cleric, who tactically endorsed the Lagos State Labour Party, LP, gubernatorial candidate, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, made the statement in a post via his verified Twitter handle on Friday. Suleman disclosed that his family members in Lagos were asking for his opinion about whom they should vote for in the state guber election. “There is something I don’t get..when things are bad in the nation, they call out pastors for being quiet. When pastors speak, they say why are they being factional.
I want to ask an honest question, as a pastor can’t I have a preferred candidate for me and my family? “I am asking because my family members in Lagos are asking me who they should vote for, if I say they should all vote @GRVlagos, people will say I have started again, that as a pastor I should support everyone.
So I won’t say anything,” he twitted.
