Gunmen have killed Reverend Musa Hyok and two of his male children in the Ganawuri community of Riyom Local Government Area of Plateau State. Plateau Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Alfred Alabo, confirmed the sad incident to journalists on Monday in Jos. Alabo said the clergyman who was a priest of the Church of Christ in Nation (COCIN), was murdered on Sunday morning. He said,” The command has commenced an investigation to unravel those behind the attack.” NAN reports that Mr Song Moro, the Youth Leader of the community, alleged that the sad incident was a reprisal attack after the killing of three Fulani youths in the community. Moro said,” Trouble started when some suspected Fulani kidnappers were arrested last Wednesday, which is our market day but later escaped in the hands of Fulani Vigilante who were to keep them before the arrival of security operatives. ‘The situation degenerated into an argument and later escalated to a clash leading to the death of three Fulani youths despite several meetings and appeals for calm. ” We suspect that the situation led to this attack on an innocent family that knows nothing about last Wednesday’s incident.”
