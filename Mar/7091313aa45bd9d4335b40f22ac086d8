Bauchi State Governor, Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed has commiserated with the people of Duguri town in Alkaleri Local Government Area of the state over Wednesday’s violence, leading to the death of one Malam Maiunguwa Shata and 15 others sustaining varying degrees of injuries during the visit of the gubernatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the area. While commiserating with the family of the deceased and other victims, Governor Mohammed described the incident as ill-motivated and unfortunate. According to the governor, an indigene of Duguri, the incident came at a time when the state government and relevant security agencies were making concerted efforts to protect the lives and property of citizens of the state. “Honestly, it is a very unfortunate incident. On Wednesday, we were in Bauchi at the instance of the Commissioner of Police and all the security agencies to sign a peace accord. I was the first to be there. When I came back, I was alerted that the APC gubernatorial candidate was coming to my home town,” he explained.
