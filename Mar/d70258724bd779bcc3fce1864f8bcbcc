Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, governorship candidate in Lagos, Azeez Adeniran (Jandor), has refuted a possible alliance with the Labour Party, LP. The governorship and House of Assembly poll will be held across the country on Saturday, the 11th of March 2023. Jandor said he was not in talks with the LP flagbearer Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour nor “the real owners of PDP structure” in Lagos. Head of Media, JandorFunke 2023 Campaign Council, Hakeem Amode issued a statement on Monday. Amode said the claim credited to Rhodes-Vivour was disrespectful to the PDP, “as no one can lay claims to the ownership structure”. “Whoever the LP candidate is talking to represents themselves and not Lagos PDP,” the spokesperson asserted. “No official conversation across the two-party lines at the moment, and Jandor is not planning to step down.” Amode said Adeniran became a household name on his own merit due to immense hard work, not “sudden waves”. The PDP added that it expects to see the decision of the people of Lagos to break free “respected and defended” on March 11. The statement said efforts to liberate the state “from the present oligarchy of the APC cannot be undermined or subjected to social media cruise” The ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, has intensified campaigns and consultations for Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s reelection.
