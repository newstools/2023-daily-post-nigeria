Real Madrid boss, Carlo Ancelotti has described as ‘strange’ Barcelona’s style of play in their 1-0 win in the Copa del Rey on Thursday evening. Eder Militao’s first-half own goal separated both sides and gave Xavi’s men a slim advantage going into the second leg of their semi-final at Nou Camp. Ancelloti’s side did not register a shot on target at the Bernabeu as the Catalans produced a ‘strange’ defensive display against their hosts. And Ancelotti feels Barcelona do not deserve to win the game as they refused to play attacking football which they are known for. “It’s been a bit strange to see them [Barcelona] play like this,” Ancelotti said of Barcelona after Madrid’s defeat. Asked if he felt their archrivals deserved their victory, Ancelotti replied: “No, it’s pretty obvious. “There have hardly been any occasions. I think it’s been one of our best games defensively all season.”
