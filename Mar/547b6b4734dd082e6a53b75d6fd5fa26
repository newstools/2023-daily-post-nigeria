The South-East leadership of the African Democratic Congress, ADC, has reacted to the widespread speculations that it has collapsed its structure to the Labour Party. The party described it as unfair and unkind to the support it massively gave to the main presidential candidate of the LP, Dr Peter Obi, at the concluded february 25 presidential election. Very Rev P. C Okeiyi, the southeast Publicity Secretary of the ADC and the Secretary of Abia State ADC Campaign council, who made the clarification in a statement on Saturday, said the claims were untrue. He appealed to every eligible voter in the zone to troop out en-masse and vote for the African Democratic Congress in the forthcoming march 18th 2023 in all states in the region. It further maintained that all her candidates for the coming gubernatorial and State House of Assembly polls are fully in the race. According to the party, “do not be deceived that ADC has adopted anyone. ADC never adopted any candidate as Bishop Dr Sunday Ndukwo Onuoha remains in the race for Abia gubernatorial and all our state House of Assembly candidates.” DAILY POST reports that before the conduct of the presidential and National Assembly elections, the Governorship candidate of the ADC, Bishop Sunday Ndukwo Onuoha endorsed Peter Obi, and hinged his decision on the capacity and competence of the ex-governor of Anambra state.
