Nasarawa State governor, Abdullahi Sule, has called for the sustenance of the peaceful coexistence among the diverse religious groups in the state while urging the people of the state to guard against anything that could result in religious intolerance. Gov Sule, condemning the provocative and inciting videos trending on social media, cautioned those seeking to use religion to cause division ahead of the March 11 governorship and House of Assembly elections. The governor gave the warning during a meeting with leaders of the Jaamatul Nasril Islam (JNI) and Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), at Government House on Saturday, saying that it is detrimental to the peace, unity and development of the state and country. The governor explained that Nasarawa State cannot afford a religious war because of its heterogeneous composition whereby members of the same family belong to different religions, stressing that the state has always been seen as peaceful. According to him: “The essence of the meeting, in reality, is because of a very unfortunate situation that is beginning to unfold in our state.” He admonished religious leaders to intercede by using their offices to caution their followers on the use of inciting utterances for political gains and rather work together for the development of the state.
