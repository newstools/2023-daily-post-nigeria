The pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, has waded into the controversies surrounding the indigeneship of the Labour Party governorship candidate in Lagos State, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour. Since the Labour Party won the presidential election in Lagos State, the party’s governorship candidate has been facing issues over his source of origin as many described him an Igbo man from the South East. But, Afenifere in a communique after its Special General Meeting at Isanya-Ogbo in Ijebu-Ode Local Government Area of Ogun State on Wednesday, said Gbedebo is a Yoruba man. According to the communique jointly signed by the Acting National Leader and the Secretary-General of Afenifere, Pa Ayo Adebanjo and Chief Sola Ebiseni, Afenifere said Gbedebo’s great-grandparents were Yorubas and co-founders of Lagos. The group called on Nigerians to troop out en masse and participate fully in the governorship and state houses of assembly elections slated for Saturday, March 11. “With particular reference to Lagos State, Afenifere confirms that the governorship candidate of the Labour Party, Mr. Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour is a person of Yoruba origin, whose great-grandparents are not only Yoruba, but definitely one of the notable founding families of Lagos. “We unequivocally endorse and urge the people of Lagos to vote for him,” the communique read in part.
