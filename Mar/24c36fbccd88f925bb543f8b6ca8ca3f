The police in Niger State have nabbed four youths in connection with the restiveness that rocked the Minna metropolis and its environs which resulted in several residents sustaining injuries and the wanton destruction of properties. In the last four days, restive youths had unleashed terror on residents of Barkin Sale, Kpakungu, Stadium Road, Limawa and Mobile roundabout. During the attacks, many people were injured, maimed, harassed and intimidated. Likewise, properties were destroyed. Confirming the incident, the Niger State Police Command Public Relations Officer, DSP Wasiu Abiodun said those arrested were picked from Morris and Stadium Road locations in connection with the attacks. He also explained that police personnel had been drafted to blackspots in a bid to curb the menace. DAILY POST correspondent learnt that the restive youth groups who were alleged political thugs unleashed their well-coordinated attacks on residents without any action from appropriate security operatives. Armed with different dangerous weapons, the youths blocked major roads and streets making it difficult for human and vehicular movement. A Minna resident, Malam Ibrahim Abdullahi, who decried the increasing attacks by unruly youths in the city, said: “We are calling on the government and security agencies, especially the Nigerian Police to do the needful before this situation gets out of hand. Parents also need to step up in bringing up their children/wards [properly] or face the wrath of the law.” Another resident, Mohammed Tanko said: “These youths have been disturbing the peace of residents of Minna. During the recent attacks, they injured many people and destroyed and looted property. We are calling on government to rise up to this situation and address the trend before it gets out of control.”
