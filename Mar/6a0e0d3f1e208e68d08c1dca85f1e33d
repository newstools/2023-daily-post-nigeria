NYCN National President, Sukubo Saraigbe Sukubo, in a message signed by the National Public Relations Officer of the Council, ‘Dotun Omoleye, said the youths received Tinubu’s victory with much enthusiasm. “The Nigerian youths are confident of the President-elect’s exceptional capacity to engage the youth population in creative and other resourceful enterprises to lower the bar of insufficient jobs, fight insecurity, and stimulate the intellectual assets required to develop our nation. The NYCN implored the President-elect to immediately put measures in place towards tackling the menaces that have constituted existential hurdles to our innovative efforts by forming a strategic partnership with the private sector, as it remains the most significant job provider in any country. “In addition, we implore the incoming President to implement the critical part of his manifesto that touches on the Students Loan and the promise to guarantee a hitch-free academic calendar. “The Council said the interventions are crucial to funding the education of younger people from vulnerable homes and also serve as an encouragement to motivate younger minds to be productive and develop strong ties with their nation as responsible citizens. “While assuring the incoming government of our unflinching support, we urge the President-elect, in the spirit of sportsmanship, and his avowed acceptance of dissent choices, to work closely with other co-contestants in a bid to run an all-inclusive government and reunite the nation”.
