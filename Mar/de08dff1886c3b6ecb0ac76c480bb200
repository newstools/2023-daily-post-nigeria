Former Arsenal midfielder, Cesc Fabregas has backed Mikel Arteta’s side to win the Premier League title this season. Fabregas also singled out four Arsenal players, Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Martinelli and Emile Smith Rowe. Arsenal is currently five points ahead of second position Manchester City in the Premier League table. When asked if Arsenal can win the Premier League title, Fabregas said on Kammy and Ben’s Proper Football Podcast said: “Yes, I really hope so because I feel a bit identified with this group of players – with the Odegaards, the Sakas, Martinellis, Smith Rowes. I can see myself in their eyes…I was at the training ground recently and I saw them and they are super good kids. Humble, they want to work hard. “There’s a lot of chemistry between them and we really had that. It is just once we were getting into March… April, March, it was always [at] that moment where we could not keep up because of injuries.”
