An attack on the acting Deputy Chairman of All Progressives Congress, APC, in Adamawa State, Alhaji Saidu Naira, has pitted the party against one of the senators in its fold, Ishaku Abbo. Abbo, accused by the executives of the party of masterminding the attack, dismissed the accusation, saying he could not stoop that low to commit such an act. The Adamawa State APC executives in a press statement in Yola on Wednesday said Naira was brutally savaged with a knife in the night last Friday during a stakeholder meeting in Mubi North LGA. “He (Naira) was later bundled into the booth of a vehicle and taken away, with his car ransacked and his personal belongings taken away. It took the intervention of the military before he was dropped unconscious at the Mubi police station,” the APC said in the statement signed by its chairman, Hon Samaila Tadawus. The party leadership said the incident was perpetuated by Senator Ishaku Abbo and his thugs, as attested to by Naira himself and the Mubi North local government party chairman, Alhaji Usman Isah. The party had urged the relevant security agencies to arrest and prosecute Abbo for kidnapping and attempted murder. Reacting to the charge, however, Ishaku Abbo said he could not descend so low to attack people just because they disagree on certain issues. Making his point through his Media Aide, Micheal Bolgent, Abbo said he had no hand in the attack in whatever form, stressing that he did not sponsor anybody to attack the state party deputy chairman or anyone. DAILY POST reports that Senator Abbo won the Adamawa North Senatorial election last Saturday, but he travelled a rough road to the victory. He had been in court fighting off a suspension slammed on him by the Mubi North executives of the party. It took the Court of Appeal just last week to lift the suspension and grant him the right to participate in the election on Saturday.
