Former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has said Peter Obi of the Labour Party is following in the footsteps of Nnamdi Azikiwe, Arthur Nzeribe, by calling for the cancellation of a free and fair election. Fani-Kayode, a Tinubu, Shettima Presidential Campaign Council member, disclosed this on Friday through his verified Twitter page. Reacting to the rejection of the President-elect, Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s victory at the just concluded presidential poll by Peter Obi and Atiku Abubakar of the People’s Democratic Party, the APC chieftain wondered why Nigerian politicians were calling for the annulment of a free and fair election. “Why do Nigerian politicians call for the annulment of a free & fair election after losing & for the scrapping of the Electoral Commission that conducted it? Zik did so after Shagari’s 1979 election, Nzeribe did so after Abiola’s 1993 election & Obi did so after BAT’s 2023 election,” he said. DAILY POST reported that Peter Obi, Atiku Abubakar, has headed to the Presidential Court of Appeal Tribunal to challenge Tinubu’s victory. Tinubu, the former Governor of Lagos state, was declared the 25 February presidential election winner by the Independent National Electoral Commission.
