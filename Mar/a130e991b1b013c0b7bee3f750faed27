Famous Nigerian social critic, Aisha Yesufu, has claimed that many of the polling unit results in last Saturday’s Presidential election were changed. Yesufu, who was a guest on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Thursday night, said that even Lagos State, where the Labour Party (LP) won, was rigged. She claimed that the All Progressives Congress (APC) got lower votes than was officially allocated to them by the INEC. Yesufu said, “What we are saying is that even the Lagos State [figure] was rigged, the number that APC got is much lower than what we finally have. And one of the things we are talking about is that in a lot of polling units, results were changed. “And I think one of the things they forgot was the fact that there is going to be an iReV where polling unit results were going to be uploaded; it is not what they normally have where they just collate and have everything in a lump. And so people can see and a lot of people have the results.” Recall that APC’s Bola Tinubu was announced the winner of the February 25 presidential poll on Wednesday morning. He defeated the main opposition candidates, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP’s Atiku Abubakar and Labour Party’s Peter Obi and New Nigeria Peoples Party and NNPP’s Rabiu Kwankwaso. The former Lagos State governor received his Certificate of Return in Abuja on Wednesday.
