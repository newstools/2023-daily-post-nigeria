Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to disclose details of the measures his government is taking to effectively obey the Supreme Court decision extending the validity of the old N200, N500, and N1,000 notes. SERAP also urged Buhari “to disclose the measures that his government is taking to direct the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to immediately re-circulate the Naira notes, as ordered by the apex court. In the letter dated on Saturday and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organization said, “There is an overriding public interest in disclosing the details of the measures your government and the CBN are taking to effectively and satisfactorily obey the Supreme Court decision. “The public should not be kept in the dark on what your government and the CBN are doing to implement the decision. Widely publishing the implementation measures would also improve accountability of state officials and public confidence in the rule of law and Nigeria’s democracy.” Recall that the Supreme Court had last week extended the validity of the old Naira notes until 31 December. The apex court stated that the CBN must continue to receive the old Naira notes from Nigerians. The Court held that Buhari’s instruction on the redesign of the new Naira notes without due consultation was illegal.
