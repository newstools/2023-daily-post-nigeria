Former Liverpool star, Danny Murphy, has urged Manchester United to sign Barcelona’s Frenkie de Jong and revealed who the midfielder would replace at Old Trafford. Man United were heavily linked with a move for De Jong last summer. But De Jong ended up staying at Barcelona. However, Murphy believes De Jong would be a ‘really big addition’ for Erik ten Hag’s side and reckons the Netherlands international would at once slot in beside Casemiro, pushing Christian Eriksen out of the team. “In effect, De Jong would play where Christian Eriksen is playing alongside Casemiro and Eriksen would be used more of a squad player,” Murphy said on the FIVE YouTube channel. “That is probably why they went for Eriksen when they didn’t get De Jong because they are both creative. De Jong is more athletic and a bit better at receiving the ball, but they are similar. “Frenkie de Jong is a super talent and he would be a big, big addition for them. It would be a really big addition for Manchester United.”
