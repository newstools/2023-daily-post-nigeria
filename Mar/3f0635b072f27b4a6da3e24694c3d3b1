A former Governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole has said that either Atiku Abubakar or Peter Obi is lying for claiming victory in last Saturday’s presidential election. Candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and that of the Labour Party, LP, addressed the press separately for the first time on Thursday after the announcement of the election result by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, on Wednesday. INEC declared on Wednesday that Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the APC was the winner of the Saturday, 25th February, 2023, presidential election. During their separate briefings, the two politicians vowed to go to court to challenge the victory of Bola Tinubu and the APC, insisting that their mandates were stolen by the ruling party. Obi categorically told the press that he won the presidential election in an earlier press conference and Atiku made the victory claim later on Wednesday evening. But a former Chairman of the Nigerian Labour Congress, NLC, who won the Edo North senatorial election on Saturday, said the two men are accusing themselves of rigging each other out. “Between His Excellency Peter Obi, my very good friend and His Excellency Atiku Abubakar, one of them must be lying,” Oshiomhole told Channels TV. “So, between the two of them, they must be trying to rig each other out, so one of them must be lying and when they go to court, I am sure that is one thing that will be shown when you have two people claiming victory. “So, they are indirectly accusing one another of rigging each other out even for the second position,” he added.
