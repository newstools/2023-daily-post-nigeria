Nigerian singer, Bankole Wellington, aka Banky W, has spoken on his loss to the candidate of Labour Party in the just concluded Lagos State Eti-Osa Federal Constituency election. Banky W lost to Labour Party’s candidate, Attah Thaddeus. Attah won the election with 24,075 votes, beating Banky W with 18,666 votes, and Babajide Obanikoro of the All Progressives Congress, APC, with 16, 901 votes. Reacting on his Instagram page on Monday, Banky W said if things had gone according to plan, he would have travelled to get an apartment and office space in Abuja. Speaking in his church, Banky W said faith in God does not mean that you won’t get hurt. “For anyone who’s ever suffered through a loss, a disappointment or a situation where things just didn’t work out the way you hoped.. ‘Faith after a fall’ is for you, for me. “This was to be our Thanksgiving service. After the election is over and we come and we are celebrating, thanking God. And I was going to give a short charge to say see what the Lord has done. “And then, we use that to build up your faith and give God some praise. Then we finish the service and I go to Abuja to start looking for apartment and office space. “Your faith in God does not stop you from hurting, but it helps you heal, and it helps you deal,” he added.
