The gubernatorial candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, in Jigawa State, Malam Aminu Ibrahim Ringim, has debunked the rumour of his withdrawal from the race ahead of the 11th March poll. He described the rumour as the work of political desperados to achieve their political interests. Three gubernatorial candidates are in the race for the Jigawa governorship seat, including the All Progressives Congress, APC, candidate Malam Umar Namadi, Malam Aminu Ibrahim Ringim of NNPP and Mustapha Sule Lamido of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Rumour had it that Ringim was plotting to form an alliance with two other parties. He said the upsurge of fake news and misinformation was due to the popularity and acceptance of the party by the people of the state. Ringim noted that the two other political parties are jittery over the looming defeat in the 11th March general election. According to him, “we are neither for any candidate nor any political party therefore, the claimed alliance with any other political party is false and unfounded.” “NNPP is the only party which is capable of considering the yearnings and aspirations of the common man.” Ringim, therefore, urged the good people of the state to come out en mass and vote for the NNPP and all its candidates on the 11th March 2023 polls.
