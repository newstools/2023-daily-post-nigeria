Chelsea manager, Graham Potter has opened up on midfielder Masan Mount’s contract situation at the club. Mount is likely to leave Chelsea this summer transfer window after talks between his representatives and the Blues hit a wall over a contract extension. The England international has less than 18 months left on his current contract with Chelsea, and he has made it clear that his preference is to remain at the west London club. But Potter believes the situation surrounding Mount’s contract is complicated, adding that he is not naive and it is important for the player to make the right choice for himself. Speaking ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League tie with Leicester City on Saturday evening, Potter said, “It is between the club and Mason. I have spoken to him several times about life in general. My feelings for Mason are clear and I think he is a fantastic person. But sometimes, these things happen. It is complicated there and it is best I speak a little about it. “I am not naive and I know it is an important contract for him. These things have to be right for him and his family and it is important he makes the right choice for him.”
