President-elect, Bola Tinubu has hailed the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, for the conduct of the 2023 Presidential elections. Tinubu stated this while giving his acceptance speech on Wednesday, shortly after he was declared the winner of last Saturday’s presidential election. The former Lagos State governor said, “I want to commend INEC for a credible election. We recognize the election as credible and the international observers also acknowledged the credibility of the election. “With this election, we’ve created the biggest democracy as Nigerians and we must be proud of that.” DAILY POST recalls that the Chairman of the INEC, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, had declared Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress as the winner of the 2023 presidential election. Tinubu defeated PDP’s Atiku Abubakar and Labour Party’s Peter Obi, among other presidential candidates who took part in the election.
