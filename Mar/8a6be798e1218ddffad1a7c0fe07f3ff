Italian agent, Guiseppe Pisano has backed Ademola Lookman to improve his performance at Atalanta. Lookman had a strong start at Atalanta but seems to have struggled in recent outings. The 24-year-old has failed to register a goal in his last six league games. But despite the drought, Pisano is upbeat that the Nigeria international will hit top form soon. “Thanks to Gasperini, he is growing week after week, and we are sure that he will be even more of a protagonist.” he was quoted by Tutto Atalanta. Lookman linked up with Atalanta from Bundesliga club, RB Leipzig last summer. The winger has tallied 12 goals and recorded five assists in 24 league appearances for La Dea.
