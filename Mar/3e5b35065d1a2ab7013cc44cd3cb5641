The Premier League returns this weekend after European football in midweek. This weekend, matches in Game Week 27 will be played in stadiums across England. Which of the fixtures are we likely to see shock results? 1. Bournemouth vs Liverpool: Saturday’s early kick-off sees Liverpool travel to Bournemouth. Jurgen Klopp’s men pulled off what is probably the result of the season, when they hammered rivals Manchester United 7-0 at Anfield. But they have to let go of that euphoria when they visit the Vitality Stadium, as they face their relegation-threatened hosts. 2. Man Utd vs Southampton: The Red Devils may have bounced back from the mauling in the hands of Liverpool with a 4-1 win over Real Betis in the Europa League. But the LaLiga side did not provide a stern test for Erik ten Hag’s men. You can trust Southampton, who are fighting for their topflight status, to give them a proper game of football at St Marys. 3. Crystal Palace vs Man City: Pep Guardiola’s men are not the most convincing in away matches. Last season, they failed to score a single goal against Crystal Palace in the two games they faced each other in the league. City cannot afford to drop points as they are already trailing Arsenal in the title race. But they must put up a solid performance at Selhurst Park. 4. Leicester vs Chelsea: Graham Potter was able to buy himself some time with back-to-back victories against Leeds United and Borussia Dortmund. However, this weekend, he takes his team to the King Power Stadium. Leicester City have been unlucky to get anything from their last two games against Manchester United and Arsenal. So the Blues have to be wary as they seek to continue their fresh winning run.
