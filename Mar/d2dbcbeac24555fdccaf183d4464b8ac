Manchester United legend, Andy Cole has said that he cannot understand why Erling Haaland is still being criticised by many sport lovers and pundits. The Norwegian has scored 33 goals in 34 games in all competitions for Manchester City this season. This includes 27 strikes in 25 league outings. Manchester City trails Arsenal by five points. Some feel that City are trailing Arsenal this season due to the arrival of the former Borussia Dortmund’ attacker. “People say he shouldn’t have signed for Man City because he doesn’t fit in. But if I’ve got 27 goals by February, and everyone’s telling me that I’ve made the wrong move… what’s the right move, then?” He told Yahoo Sport. “You’ve got 27 goals by the end of February, and you’ve got the chance to get to 40 goals. I’m not sure what everyone expects for him,” he added.
