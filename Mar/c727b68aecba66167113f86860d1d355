Ahead of the March 11 governorship election, a spokesperson for the Labour Party Obi-Datti Presidential Campaign Council, Mr Kenneth Okonkwo has charged party supporters to come out en masse to vote LP. In a statement he issued on Thursday, the famous Nollywood actor allayed fears of being attacked and killed during the election, stating that it is irresponsible to fear death. Contrary to insinuations that the governorship election may also be rigged as allegedly done during the presidential poll, Okonkwo assured the supporters of the Labour Party, known as Obidients that their votes will count. The statement reads partly: “This revolution has just started. Let us use this opportunity to win all the gubernatorial seats for the revolution using the Labour Party platform. Don’t allow anybody [to] tell you that your votes will not count. Your votes will count. It may take time but they will count. If you don’t vote, there will be nothing to fight for, if you vote, we will have something to fight for. “Don’t allow anyone tell you that you will be killed if you come out. We are already dead in the face of tyranny if we keep quiet, so what are we still afraid of? Death must come one day so it’s irresponsible to fear what is sure to come. It’s better to invest someone’s life in a good cause and trust God for the best. “Come out on March 11th to vote for Labour Party. This will help in actualizing our mandate, which we obtained through Peter Obi.” Peter Obi on Thursday rejected the Saturday presidential election results, saying he has evidence that he won the poll. The former Anambra governor vowed to seek redress in court stating that his stolen mandate must be recovered.
