Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari has expressed optimism that Nigeria under the newly elected President, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu would prosper beyond measurable doubts. Masari who disclosed this shortly after INEC announced Tinubu as a winner of the 2023 presidential election said: “Tinubu is competent and capable of leading the country to the promised land.” The Katsina Governor said Nigeria under the former Lagos Governor would experience the needed socio-economic development, same as Lagos. “The man (Tinubu) has got the brain and the capacity. He is an effective manager of men and resources. “I have no doubt that he’s going to galvanise the nation and propel it to greater heights, making it a pride not only of Black Africans but of all Blacks all over the world. “He did it in Lagos and he will do it for Nigeria,” Masari said. Masari who recalled the horrible state of Lagos before Tinubu became its Governor said, “Lagos in 1999 was a city invaded by ‘Area Boys’ almost similar to bandits the bandits operating in the North. “Before Asiwaju came on board, in Lagos, you find dead bodies on heaps of rubbish and roads being crushed by vehicles by daytime, like 3pm. “Cars without air condition have to wind their glasses up because of ‘Area Boys’ but today Lagos is the safest city in Nigeria due to his efforts. “And what was the economy of Lagos before he became Governor? The revenue generation was barely N600 million but before he left, it was N6 billion.”
