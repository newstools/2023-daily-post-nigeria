The outgoing British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Ms. Catriona Laing, has been described as selfless in her service to the country in the past five years. Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiama stated this on Tuesday when the outgoing British Commissioner paid him a farewell visit in Abuja. Laing Andheri’s team was at the National Assembly to officially inform the parliament of the end of her tenure in Nigeria. Describing the meeting as “bittersweet”, Gbajabiamila said, the envoy was supportive to the lower legislative Chamber throughout her sojourn in Nigeria. He said: “We will miss you, Nigeria will miss you, and the Parliament will miss you,” Gbajabiamila said. “It’s a bittersweet visit, I’ll call it. Sweet because it’s always good to have you around, and bitter because you’re going. I personally enjoyed a great working relationship with you.” Gbajabiama spoke of having a robust discussion with the High Commissioner at all times, which he looked forward to seeing the same trajectory with her successor, particularly the legislative interest which she was known for. Adding: “One of the bills that the High Commission contributed to, was the Electoral Act (Amendment Bill 2022), which was passed and was eventually signed into law.” Earlier, Ms. Catriona told the Speaker that she witnessed two election cycles in Nigeria, having resumed as the British High Commissioner to Nigeria in 2018. She described her experience in the country as wonderful.”
