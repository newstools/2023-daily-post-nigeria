Nigeria forward, Victor Osimhen, has revealed his desire to play in the Premier League in future. Osimhen has been a subject of interest from Premier League giants, Chelsea and Manchester United following a stellar campaign for Napoli. The two clubs are expected to make a move for the striker this summer. The Nigeria international has scored 21 goals in 25 appearances across all competitions for Partenopei this season. Osimhen, however, admitted his focus is on Napoli at the moment. “I think it is an ambition of all players. And who knows, maybe one day,” the Nigerian told Corriere della Sera. “Right now, I can assure you that it hasn’t even crossed my mind. It would distract me from what has been a beautiful season. Only Napoli. That’s all.”
