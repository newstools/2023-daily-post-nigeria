Former Manchester United captain, Roy Keane, has blamed the “senior players” at the club for their 7-0 defeat at Liverpool. Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah and Darwin Nunez all scored twice as the Reds crushed Erik Ten Hag’s men at Anfield. Keane, speaking on Sky Sports, slammed the more experienced members of the United squad. “A shocking day. The senior players were embarrassing. They didn’t show any leadership skills. “A really tough day for Man Utd and thank goodness I have never been part of losing like that. “The players will be ashamed when the going got tough, they went missing,” Keane said.
