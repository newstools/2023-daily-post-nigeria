Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola has hailed the President-elect, Bola Tinubu on his triumph at the general election. The former Lagos governor was Wednesday morning declared winner by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, after a keen contest last Saturday. Aregbesola, who served as commissioner when Tinubu was governor, later contested in the Osun governorship election and won. The minister and Tinubu were at loggerheads over the choice of former Governor Adegboyega Oyetola for another term in office. Many believe the refusal of Aregbesola to openly campaign for Oyetola contributed to the loss he suffered at the hands of the PDP last year. In a statement on Thursday, he recounted the days of struggle with Tinubu before he emerged as Lagos helmsman. Titled “Jagaban: A call to duty”, Tinubu was linked to the journey from Primrose Circle, senatorial bid and victory, Justice Forum/June 12/NADECO struggle, among others. Aregbesola wished the victory would translate to the consolidation of the “eight years of massive infrastructure development and progressive policies of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration”. The minister charged Tinubu to ensure that Nigeria meets its historic responsibility to Africans and the Black Race as the leader of both entities. “I pray that God will give you good health and the wisdom needed for a successful tenure in office,” Aregbesola added.
