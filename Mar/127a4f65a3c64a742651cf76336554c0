Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara State has warned Nigerians that rejection of the old naira notes constitutes a criminal offence. AbdulRazaq also advised residents of Kwara State, particularly traders, to accept and spend both the new and old naira notes as both are still legal tenders in Nigeria. He stated this in a statement issued in Ilorin on Tuesday by his spokesman, Mr Rafiu Ajakaye. The statement reads in part: “Banks are now officially issuing the old naira notes (including N500 and N1,000). “This appeal especially goes to our marketers/traders. Further rejection of the old Naira notes is in breach of the Supreme Court judgment. “Citizens are to note that rejection of the legal tender, such as the old naira note, is a serious crime under our law.”
