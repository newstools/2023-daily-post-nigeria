The Football Association, FA, will not punish Manchester Unitedâ€™s Bruno Fernandes, following his push on an assistant referee during their 7-0 drubbing at Liverpool on Sunday. Fernandes could be seen pushing an assistant referee in frustration during the second half of the match. Tempers began to boil over as United conceded six goals in the second 45 minutes at Anfield. While the officials did not punish the Portugal midfielder, the FA can take retrospective disciplinary action for violent behaviour on the pitch. But the Daily Mail reports that the FA has decided that no action will be taken over the push, meaning Fernandes has escaped any punishment.
