The death toll of those killed on Saturday night’s fresh attack on Ungwan Wkakili community, Atyap Chiefdom in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State, has risen to 17, with about two others hospitalized for various degrees of injuries sustained in the attack. DAILY POST gathered that the recent attack might be a result of the killing of a Fulani herder four days ago in Ungwan Juju, apparently in retaliation for the killing of one of their locals last month. Mr Francis Sani Zimbo, the Zangon Kataf local government council chairman, while speaking to newsmen, condemned the attack in strong terms, saying that an investigation to ascertain the perpetrators has commenced with a view to bringing the culprits to book. He wondered why the mobile police checkpoints in the affected communities were withdrawn before last night’s attack, resulting in the attackers having a field day to carry out their nefarious activities. Some of the locals expressed displeasure at how the attack lasted for some time despite the presence of the military within the community.
