A suspect, Oni Samuel, was on Thursday ordered to remain in the custody of the correctional facility in Akure, the capital of Ondo State, by a Magistrate Court on Thursday for defrauding a commercial sex worker, Blessing Olaitan, of N120,000. Samuel was arraigned by men of the state command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC over the crime perpetrated on March 1, 2023, at the Alagbaka axis of the Akure metropolis. Olaitan who told the court that she was a professional sex worker, said the defendant allegedly collected the cash sum of N80,000 from her after having sex with her on a particular night. She further explained to the court that the defendant promised to transfer the cash to her together with another N15,000 which was her “professional fee.” The defendant allegedly utilised a fraudulent transfer for her, which the plaintiff said she later learned. A two-count allegation bothering on conspiracy and stealing was brought against the defendant in court. The charge sheet accused Oni Samuel and others at large of having committed the criminal offence of stealing the sum of N120,000 from Mrs Blessing Olaitan, an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 516 of the Criminal Code Law Cap 37, Vol. 1 Laws of Ondo State, 2006. The defendants entered a not-guilty plea to the accusations, as the Defence Attorney, Barrister E.O. Nifemi, urged the court to grant him bail. The NSCDC prosecutor, Mr David Ebriku, opposed the bail application and pleaded with the court to remand the defendant, stressing that he might jump bail and thereafter constitute a danger to society. In his ruling, Magistrate Tope Aladejana granted the defendant bail in the amount of N200,000 with two sureties in the same amount and adjourned the case for hearing until April 17, 2023.
