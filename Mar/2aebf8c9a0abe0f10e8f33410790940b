Aisha Yesufu, a popular socio-political activist and staunch supporter of Peter Obi, Labour Party candidate in the just concluded presidential election has revealed why she opted for the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, in Enugu State, Frank Nweke. Aisha, who is one of the key stakeholders in the Obidient movement is supporting the APGA governorship flagbearer for the March 18 polls. According to a tweet on her verified handle, Aisha said she had been campaigning for Nweke even before she joined the Obidient movement. She wrote, “So the Frank Nweke Jnr I have been talking about since himself and Peter Obi were in PDP I should abandon because he happened to pick a different party. “Anyway, I didn’t support Peter Obi because he was in Labour. I supported Peter Obi because he was competent. “I started campaigning for Frank Nweke Jnr even before I started campaigning for Peter Obi. Many didn’t pay attention. It is now that Labour Party is the reigning party that my campaign for @FrankNwekeII became an issue. I am not a person of long throat! I build not wait to eat!” Meanwhile, Peter Obi has asked all Obidients in Enugu state to vote for the LP candidate, Barr. Chijioke Edeoga.
