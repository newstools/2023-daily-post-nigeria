Seven state governments controlled by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Friday withdrew the suit they filed against the federal government of Nigeria over the conduct, collation and announcement of last Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections. The Notice of Discontinuance, which was signed by their lawyer, Mr. Mike Ozekhome, SAN, said, “Take notice that the plaintiffs doth hereby wholly discontinue this suit against the defendant herein”. The seven states had dragged the Federal Government of Nigeria before the Supreme Court over the conduct, collation and announcement of the outcome of the February 25 Presidential and National Assembly elections. The plaintiffs in the originating summons marked: SC/CV/354/2023 are specifically asking for an order of the apex court “directing a wholistic review of all results so far announced by the Federal Government of Nigeria through the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).” The suit was filed by the Attorneys General of Bayelsa, Adamawa, Akwa-Ibom, Delta, Edo and Sokoto State. According to the suit, the agents and officials of the federal government and INEC failed to transmit the collated result of the poll as prescribed by the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2022 and the INEC Regulations and Guidelines for the Conduct of Elections, 2022. Recall that APC’s Bola Tinubu won Saturday’s Presidential election after beating PDP’s Atiku Abubakar and LP’s Peter Obi. On Wednesday morning, INEC announced Tinubu as the winner of the Presidential election. The former Lagos State Governor has since received his Certificate of Return. He is expected to be sworn in as Nigeria’s next President next month.
