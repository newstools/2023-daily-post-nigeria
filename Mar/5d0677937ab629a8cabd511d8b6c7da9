The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has given reasons it postponed the governorship election by one week. The exercise, which was initially scheduled for this Saturday, will now take place on March 18. The National Commissioner & Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, Barr. Festus Okoye, confirmed this in a statement on Wednesday night. Okoye said the commission needed time for the reconfiguration of the BVAS used for the Presidential election held on February 25, 2023. “For instance, the BVAS can only be activated on the specific date and time of an election. “Having been used for the Presidential and National Assembly elections on 25th February 2023, it is necessary to reconfigure the BVAS for activation on the date of the governorship and State Assembly elections,” the statement read in part.
