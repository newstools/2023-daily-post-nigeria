The Delta South Senatorial Candidate of the New Nigerian Peoples Party, NNPP, Omatseye Nesiama has said he confronted alters and came victorious in the just concluded senatorial election. He made the assertion during a thanksgiving service at the First Baptist Church in Warri. Nesiama told newsmen that he vowed not to bribe anyone, especially, those he was going to lead or bow to any alters. The politician claimed he was going to the Senate to represent God but that his constituents were obviously not aware of his motives. In his words, “It’s not over. It’s possible I may not come back for elective office again. “I didn’t borrow any money. I am not owing anybody. I didn’t sell any property” for this election. “I’ve come across principalities and powers. I have seen betrayals.” Nesiama said he was pushed to meet someone he vowed never to meet when he was stifled of funds. He explained that if he had met the individual, he would have been made to sign an agreement to be loyal, probably take an oath or forced into a cult. “I refused to do all that. I maintained the message of hope, restoration and accountability. We are all living with our heads high.” Commodore Nesiama said his wife and children refused to stay abroad but instead decided to come and join him during the election where other politicians were flying their families out of the country for the election. The Minister In Charge of First Baptist Church, Warri, Rev.(Dr )Justin Okoroji, the officiating minister in his reaction, told Nesiama and his supporters that they are the true winners of the sensational election in Delta South. “You were the true winners in this Delta. Two strong alters controlled to make sure your votes never counted but your votes counted in Jesus Name. I salute all of you. God will remember you.” He urged Commodore Nesiama to do whatever he can to maintain the Hope Actualization and Restoration Movement. “Apart from you, God could raise many. You’re the winner.”
