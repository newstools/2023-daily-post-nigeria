Comrade Timi Frank, a former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has urged the Appeal Court to discard a request by the National Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, for an order of court to reconfigure the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) machines. Last Friday, the court in its ruling granted permission to the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi, his Labour Party, LP, counterpart to inspect the sensitive materials used for the conduct of last month’s presidential election. Yakubu had, in his motion before the court, said the order needed variation to allow it to deploy the machines for this weekend’s governorship and State House of Assembly elections. However, Frank, in a statement in Abuja on Tuesday, urged the Appeal Court not to change its orders nor grant INEC’s request to reconfigure the BVAS machines, insisting that it is ungodly. Frank’s statement partly read: “I hereby urge the Appeal Court not to vary its orders nor accede to the request of INEC to reconfigure the BIVAS machines. “The request of INEC in all its ramifications is anti-people, ungodly, preposterous, jejune and beyond imagination. “It is a ploy by INEC to hide and bury germane evidence that would enable the various opposition parties to prove their election petition cases before the courts.”
