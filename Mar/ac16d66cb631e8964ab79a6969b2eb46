Ahead of Saturday’s governorship election, Asari Dokubo, a former Niger Delta militant leader, has given a reason he is supporting Tonye Cole, the All Progressives Congress, APC, gubernatorial candidate in Rivers State. Dokubo said he is supporting Cole because he knows what the APC gubernatorial candidate can do. He stated this while speaking on Arise Television’s The Morning Show on Wednesday. Dokubo said, “In 2013, I was in Sao Paulo Brazil to watch the [2014] World Cup. My friend and I went out and we went somewhere and we saw a Mall in which we went to do some window shopping, and in one of the shops somebody told us that a Nigerian was one of the designers of this Mall and he told us that Tonye Cole was among the designers of this Mall and it struck me and I said if somebody like Tonye Cole can design a Mall like this in faraway Brazil why cannot he replicate it. “In 2019, when Tonye Cole came up to contest an election, I think my house was one of the first spots of call he came to. I have never met him and when he came, I told him in 2013 I was in Brazil, and I saw a Mall that you designed alongside other architects, and he just smiled and said my brother, this is what I will replicate in Rivers state. “A lot of our people, political campaigns, I am going to bring water, I am going to do that… we don’t want a government salt, we want to change, and that is why I am campaigning for Tonye Cole.” He added, “I was president of Ijaw youth. Whether I say I’m a Kalabari man or not, people will say Tonye is a Kalabari man. He is a Kalabari man that speaks Yoruba and Igbo. He cannot speak Kalabari. I know what he can do, and that is why I am supporting him.”
