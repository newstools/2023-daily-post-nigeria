The secretary to the Peoples Democratic Party Deaf Supporters(PDS), Yusuf Gusau has faulted Zamfara State’s political setup. Speaking with DAILY POST in Gusau, the secretary lamented Zamfara Central zone has never produced a governor in the state since 1999 when Nigeria regained democracy from the military. According to him, in 1999, Zamfara West produced Governor Ahmed Yarima, while Zamfara North produced Governor Mahmuda Aliyu Shinkafi in 2007. Both governors Abdul Aziz Yari and Bello Matawalle also came from Zamfara West, he noted. Gusau enjoined the Zamfara electorate to balance the political equation by voting Dr Dauda Lawal Dare of PDP in the forthcoming governorship election in the State. “We expect that the next governorship election will produce a governor from the Zamfara Central zone,” he added, citing Sokoto State as a model example where the governorship position was shared fairly from 1999 to date. “Governor Attahiru Bafarawa came from Sokoto East and governed the state from 1999 to 2007; Aliyu Wamakko came from Sokoto Central and governed between 2007 to 2015, [and now] Governor Waziri Tambuwal from Sokoto South has been in office from 2015,” he stated.
