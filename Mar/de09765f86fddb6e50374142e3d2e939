The ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, in Kwara State, has alleged that the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has perfected plans to hack into Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, portals to manipulate the process of next Saturday’s gubernatorial and House of Assembly elections to its advantage. A statement in Ilorin on Tuesday by the spokesman of the party in the state, Aro Tajudeen Folaranmi, urged the electoral umpire to be vigilant in the use of its various electronic platforms for the exercise. “Of particular concern is the information at our disposal that the opposition party has perfected plans to hack into INEC portals to manipulate the process to its advantage. “This is what the PDP is now banking on to re-impose an expired political dynasty on the state after its total rejection by the people. We therefore call for absolute vigilance,” the statement stated. The party also advised the electoral umpire to improve on the challenges of logistics that slowed down the conduct of the last Presidential and National Assembly elections. “We are convinced that INEC would have conducted some reviews of the last election to identify areas where it has to do better in the coming and future polls. “We feel especially compelled to call on the INEC to address the late arrival of its officials and materials to various polling units. Equally important is the rampant incident of insufficient electoral materials, including the ink,” the party said. “As the professional body, we are certain that INEC must have discovered some other things that should be improved upon, and we hope to see such improvements on Saturday. “All said, we commend the body for its exemplary conduct during the last election, and we seek a better outing on Saturday,” it added.
