Ahead of Saturday’s governorship election, Asari Dokubo, a former Niger Delta militant leader, has revealed what he wants from the next Governor of Rivers State that will take over from Gov. Nyesom Wike. Speaking on Arise Television’s The Morning Show on Wednesday, Dokubo said he wants the next Governor of Rivers State to divert the wealth of the state to investment. According to him, he doesn’t want the next governor to be building flyovers without investing in the people and investing to make them stronger. Dokubo said, “What I want the next governor to do is to divert the wealth of Rivers people to investment. To invest in the economy of Rivers State and to create wealth. “That should be first and foremost to create wealth and that is the direction of Tonye Cole [the All Progressives Congress, APC gubernatorial candidate in Rivers State]. I would not want a governor who will be building flyovers, and so on or who will be building skyscrapers without investing in the people and investing to make them stronger. “To send Rivers people to be skilled people. If you come to Rivers State today, our people, when they finish their tertiary education, they are not employable because the schools did not provide a good environment for them to be employed.”
