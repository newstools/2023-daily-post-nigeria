Gambia head coach, Abdoulie Bojang claimed his side deserved to beat the Flying Eagles of Nigeria in Monday’s semi-final clash at the 2023 Africa U-20 Cup of Nations. The Young Scorpions played second fiddle to the Flying Eagles for most of the game. Bojang’s side mustered two shots on target with the first one resulting in the goal scored by Adama Bojang on seven minutes. Nigeria missed several goal scoring chances in the game failing to make their dominance count. Substitute Ahmed Abdullahi also missed a penalty four minutes from time. “It is a deserved victory. We will fight for the title against Senegal,” Bojang told the media after the game. “Senegal is winning everything right now. We must prevent them on Saturday.”
