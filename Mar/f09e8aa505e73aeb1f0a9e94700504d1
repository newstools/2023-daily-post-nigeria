Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party for the 2023 presidential election shed tears on live television on Thursday while addressing the press for the first time after he lost the presidential election to the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu. Obi shed tears while narrating his meeting with a young Nasarawa lady, who finished university in 2018 and could not secure a job anywhere and did not have just N75,000 to buy an oven to start her bakery business. Narrating on live TV, Obi said: “One thing about me is that I always want to know what young people want. I went somewhere with my Chairman (Labour Party chairman) this afternoon and I needed to boil water for tea. I wanted to do it but she volunteered to do it. “Along the line, I asked her name, she told me. She said she’s from Nasarawa and a graduate of Nasarawa State University. About her school, [she] said she schooled in Nasarawa. She said she finished school in 2018 and has no work. I asked her what she was doing here and she said she wants to bake. “When I asked why she’s not baking, she said she doesn’t have N75,000 to buy an oven [he shed tears].”
