Candidate of the Labour Party in the February 25 House Representatives election in Abeokuta South, Tolulope Philips, has joined the governorship candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State, Ladi Adebutu, ahead of the March 11 polls. Philips said the Labour Party in Ogun Central would vote for the PDP during the governorship election in the State. While receiving Adebutu at his campaign office in Abeokuta, the LP candidate directed his supporters and Ogun residents to go out on Saturday and cast their votes for the PDP. According to him, this became necessary because the LP does not have a gubernatorial candidate in the State. He said Adebutu had been considered to be the most credible of all the gubernatorial candidates in Ogun, saying his support for the PDP leader was to ensure the dividends of democracy get to all and sundry. Philips, who lost the House of Representatives election to the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Afolabi Afuwape, said: “Labour Party has no governorship candidate. What we want in Ogun is progress. Don’t consider Saturday, let’s consider the aftermath. I didn’t collect anything from the PDP. I’m doing this because I want to get the dividends of democracy for our people in Ogun state. We must not allow our state to continue like this.” Speaking, Adebutu appreciated the LP candidate as he assured Ogun people of relief if he emerges. The governorship candidate also disclosed that his mission is to build the Ogun State that the people are yearning for. He said: “We want relief for Ogun state. We are after building the Ogun state of our dream. Let’s vote out those thieves. All our people in the Labour Party, you will not regret voting for the PDP.”
