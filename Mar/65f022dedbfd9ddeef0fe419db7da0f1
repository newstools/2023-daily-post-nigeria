The Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate, Peter Obi on Wednesday disclosed why he would be heading to the Court of Appeal. Obi said he was heading to the Appeal Court over the refusal of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to allow the LP inspect electoral materials used during the presidential election. He disclosed this while lamenting over his inability to campaign for LP governorship candidates across the country. Obi came third behind Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and the winner, Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress, APC. Following his defeat, Obi had approached the court to contest his loss and asked to be allowed to inspect materials used during the election. However, Obi, in a series of tweets, wrote: “I am supposed to commence our whistle-stop campaign for our various Labour Party Governorship and State Assembly Candidates today. Initially, my trip was to take me to Nasarawa, Lagos, Enugu, Abia, Delta, Edo, Rivers, Plateau, Borno, etc. “However, following INEC’s refusal to allow our party to inspect the materials (including BVAS) from the 25th February presidential elections, I am personally heading to the Court today with our lawyers. “As we pursue due process and defer to the rule of law, I urge all the Obidients in the various states to continue campaigning for our candidates, namely, Gbadebo Rhodes Vivour in Lagos, Chijioke Edeoga in Enugu, Patrick Dakum in Plateau, Alex Otti in Abia, Ken Pela in Delta, “Ibrahim Mshelia in Borno, to name just a few. It is also imperative that Obidients vote for candidates with Competence, Character, Capacity, and Compassion. I remain committed and will give more attention to our mission of retrieving our mandate. A new Nigeria is possible!”
