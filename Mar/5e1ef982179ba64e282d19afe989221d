Victor Osimhen will look to become the second player in history to score from open play in nine consecutive Serie A matches when Napoli takes on Lazio tonight at the Estadio Diego Armando Maradona. Former Juventus forward, David Trezeguet is the only player to have achieved the feat. Osimhen has scored in his last eight league outings for Napoli, who have established an 18-point lead at the top of the log. The Nigeria international is currently the top scorer in Serie A with 19 goals from 20 games. The 24-year-old was nominated for the Player of the Month award for February on Friday. Napoli will also look to win for the fifth time in a row without conceding, which will be a club record.
