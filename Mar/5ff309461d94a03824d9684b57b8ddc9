The Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate, Peter Obi, has been accused of nepotism following the composition of his legal team. Reno Omokri, a close ally of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, said Obi is a worse version of President Muhammadu Buhari. Omokri stressed that Nigeria avoided the Rwandan situation by not electing Obi. In a series of tweets, Omokri said Obi’s legal team should accommodate people from other tribes. Stressing that those who voted for Obi are not exclusively Igbo, Omokri said it would be hypocritical to criticise Buhari for nepotism. He wrote: “By the composition of Obi’s legal team, it is safe to say Nigeria dodged a Rwandan style bullet by not electing him President. “Now I see why he appointed an Igbo Christian as Labour’s state coordinator for Sokoto. Obi is just a worse Southern version of Buhari. “Peter Obi should have tried to broaden his legal team beyond his own tribe. He wants them to protect his votes in court. “Then why did they troll Buhari? After all, Buhari can make the same argument for his nepotism.” Following the outcome of the presidential election, the LP touch bearer had constituted twelve Senior Advocates of Nigeria as part of his legal team. The Senior Advocates of Nigeria are Dr Livy Uzoukwu, Chief Awa Kalu, Dr Onyechi Ikpeazu, P.I.N. Ikwueto, Chief Ben Anyachebe. Others include S.T. Hon, Arthur Obi Okafor, Ik Ezechukwu, J.S. Okutepa, Dr Mrs Valerie Azinge, Emeka Okpoko, and Alex Ejesieme.
