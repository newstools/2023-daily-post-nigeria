The Ohanaeze Ndigbo in Lagos State on Thursday denied calling for the resignation of Governor Sanwo-Olu. The group’s President, Chief Sunday Ossai issued a rebuttal at a press conference by the Lagos State Leaders of Thoughts. Ossai also said the people of South-East were supporting Sanwo-Olu’s re-election because he had fulfilled his campaign promises to them. The Igbo leader declared that any vote outside of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on March 11 would amount to a waste. “I am a representative of Ndigbo in the state and as their mouthpiece,” NAN quoted him “I hereby debunk the so-called statement that the Igbo body asked Sanwo-Olu to resign.” President of Igbo Speaking Community, Chief Sunday Udeh; President of Yoruba Council Worldwide, Aare Oladotun Hassan and State Women Leader, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Dr Chioma Okoro also addressed reporters.
