Aisha Yesufu, a diehard supporter of Peter Obi, has disagreed with the Obidients movement over who becomes the next Governor of Enugu State. The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi, had in a tweet called on the Obidients to come out en masse to cast their votes for their candidates in various states across the nation during their March 11 governorship and state Houses of Assembly elections. Obi wrote, “As we pursue due process and defer to the rule of law, I urge all the OBIdients in the various states to continue campaigning for our candidates, namely, Gbadebo Rhodes Vivour in Lagos, Chijoke Edeoga in Enugu, Patrick Dakum in Plateau, Alex Otti in Abia, Ken Pela in Delta, Ibrahim Mshelia in Borno, to name just a few.” Obi further called on his supporters to vote for candidates with competence, character, capacity, and compassion. But Aisha Yesufu, a supporter of the Labour Party, specifically believes that Frank Nweke Jnr of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, is the most qualified candidate to lead the State. “God forbid I become what I want to change. I can never sacrifice competence for partisanship!” She tweeted. “Frank Nweke Jnr @FrankNwekeII is the person for Enugu State. The people must be the winners and not individuals.”
