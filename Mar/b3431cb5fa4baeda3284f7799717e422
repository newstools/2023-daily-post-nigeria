The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has sent a message to Nigerians on the state of the country. The former governor of Anambra State polled 6,101,533 votes to take third place in the 25 February presidential election, and has appealed to Nigerians on the need to recalibrate their “Basic Values of Acceptable to Society,” dubbed ‘BVAS.’ “As the reconfiguration of BVAS has become our watchword today, I humbly appeal to Nigerians that it’s time to Reconfigure our own BVAS – “BASIC VALUES ACCEPTABLE TO SOCIETY. ” Have a nice Sunday and may God Almighty bless Nigeria,” he posted on his Twitter handle. Peter Obi rejected the presidential election’s outcome, which saw Bola Ahmed Tinubu emerging as the winner. Dissatisfied with the results, Peter Obi is trying to reclaim his victory through the judiciary. To this end, he hired 15 Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SAN) to pursue his case at the Presidential Election Court of Appeal Tribunal. Earlier, the court granted the request of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to reconfigure its Bimodal Voters Accreditation System, BVAS, ahead of the 18 March governorship and state House of Assembly elections, a situation which did not go down well with Peter Obi.
