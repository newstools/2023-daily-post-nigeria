Former Barcelona and Brazil star, Rivaldo, has given two pieces of advice to Manchester United after their recent Premier League 7-0 defeat to Liverpool. Recall that Liverpool humiliated Man United at Anfield as goals from Darwin Nunez, Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Fermino gave Jurgen Klopp’s side the victory over the Red Devils. Speaking ahead of Man United’s Premier League tie with Southampton on Sunday at Old Trafford, Rivaldo advised Man United to try to focus on their next Premier League game and keep working hard as they had been doing until the Liverpool defeat. “It was impossible for anyone to predict a 7-0 win for Liverpool over Manchester United,” Rivaldo told Betfair. “Fred and Casemiro had been doing a fantastic job, giving solidity to United, and suddenly everything collapsed in 45 nightmarish minutes.” He added, “My advice to them is to try to focus on the next Premier League game and keep working hard, as they had been doing until this game. The team seemed to be on the right track.”
