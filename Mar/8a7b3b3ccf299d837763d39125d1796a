Peter Ayodele Fayose, a former Governor of Ekiti State, has called for the resignation of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, due to his incapacity to take the party to the next level. Fayose stated this shortly after he congratulated the President-elect of Nigeria, Bola Tinubu, on his victory. DAILY POST reports that the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, had on Wednesday morning declared APC’s Tinubu as the winner of the 2023 presidential election. Tinubu defeated the PDP’s Atiku Abubakar and Labour Party’s Peter Obi to emerge as the winner of last Saturday’s presidential election. In a tweet via his Twitter handle on Wednesday, Fayose said, “As for the PDP National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, I call for his immediate resignation for his inability to move the party forward.” Fayosed had earlier tweeted, “I congratulate Asiwaju Bola Tinubu on his election as the next President of Nigeria. I urge other contestants, especially Atiku Abubakar to accept the outcome in the overall interest of our country. There will always be another day.”
