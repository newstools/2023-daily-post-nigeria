The Nigerian Army on Monday, said it has instituted investigations into the unfortunate incident of a soldier, who killed his colleagues and himself at Forward Operations Base (FOB) Rabbah, Sokoto State. Recall that a serving soldier shot his colleague and later shot himself on Sunday, March 5, 2023, at the FOB, where troops were deployed for internal security operations. Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, Director Army Public Relations in a statement, said that the circumstances leading to the incident could not be immediately ascertained, as the soldier who killed his colleagues also shot himself immediately. According to him, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 8 Division Nigerian Army, who also doubles as the Commander Joint Task Force Northwest Operation Hadarin, Daji Major General Godwin Mutkut and other senior officers have visited the location, and commiserated with troops for losing their colleagues in such an unfortunate situation. He urged them to be their brother’s keepers and report any anomaly observed amongst their colleagues in order to forestall such incidents, just as encouraged them to remain calm and committed in the discharge of their duties. “The authorities of the Nigerian Army are deeply concerned about this unusual and ugly development and have therefore instituted a Board of Inquiry (BOI) to unravel the circumstances surrounding the incident,” the statement added. According to the statement, it’s expected that the findings of the BOI will help forestall such ugly and bizarre occurrences in the future.
