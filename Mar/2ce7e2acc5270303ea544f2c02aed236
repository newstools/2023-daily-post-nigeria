Ahead of the Saturday governorship and state assembly elections, the Coalition of South East Youth Leaders, COSEYL, has warned against any plot to assassinate the Labour party candidate in Lagos State, Gbadebo Patrick Rhodes-Vivour. DAILY POST reports that there has been a series of video clips flying on social media threatening the LP candidate and those intending to vote for him in the coming poll. Some thugs had also threatened to attack Igbo traders in parts of the state if they failed to vote for the incumbent governor and candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Reacting to the threats, COSEYL in a statement issued by its President General, Goodluck Ibem warned against any attack, saying Lagos State is for everybody. The statement reads in part: “We condemn in strongest terms the evil plot by political thugs in Lagos State to assassinate the Labour Party gubernatorial candidate, Architect Gbadebo Patrick. We warn them to drop such evil plots. “We warn MC Oluomo and his thugs to steer clear of voting centres and stop harassing and intimidating innocent voters with dangerous weapons. The voters only want to exercise their franchise. “We condemn the undemocratic role played by the ruling party to rig the vote of Nigerians who came out en masse to vote for presidential and National Assembly candidates of their choices in Lagos State. We warn that such should not repeat itself in the forthcoming elections. “It is forward ever and backwards never. We as Nigerian youths are united in this fight to have a better nation where elected political office holders will be accountable to the people who elected them and not to any godfather anywhere.”
